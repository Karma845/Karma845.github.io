<h3>Chapter 1: The Other Side of the Maiden</h3>

<p>What would you do if you discovered a person who is seen by the rest of the world as the epitome of beauty and elegance, just like a mature maiden&hellip; But, in reality she&rsquo;s like a princess who loves pretty things and possesses childish thoughts?</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m asking this question because I&rsquo;m in that very situation. Right now, I am witnessing such a cute girl that breaks any barrier of such meaning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;*sigh*&hellip; I wish I had that kind of love life&hellip; I wonder if I will have my own prince someday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Said person who was whispering to herself while letting out a depressing sigh was sitting by a window of the restaurant. I was totally enraptured as I watched her place the book in her hands on the table with great elegance.</p>

<p>&mdash;She is&hellip; Himemiya-san?</p>

<p>Her name is Himemiya Kanade. Me, Okugawa Yuto are acquaintances&hellip; Well, to be more specific, classmates in high school. But there is something that puzzles me about all this, as the same Himemiya-san I see in high school, is very different from the one I&rsquo;m seeing right now.</p>

<p>This is because she is an extremely popular person not only among boys, also among girls, consequently, she is very idolized, to the point of being nicknamed as; &lsquo;The princess of Amanodate&rsquo; or &lsquo;The goddess of Amanodate&rsquo;, which is the name of the place where we studied.</p>

<p>Her eyes were just like two crystalline jewels, with a straight nose and a beautiful, otherworldly face. She has the perfect appearance of a princess in a fairy tale&hellip; Or in other cases, like a war goddess depicted in 15th century paintings.</p>

<p>Her black hair was as pure as Vanta black, reminding me of the clear night sky. Seeing Himemiya-san conveyed a lot of peace and serenity to me. Her fantastic beauty was reflected in her whole appearance, her good dress was undoubtedly exceptional. Her large, lushly shaped breasts were like the icing on the cake. It is no exaggeration to say that she possessed a beauty that transcended the human body. God was unfair to create a girl as perfect as she was.</p>

<p>Obviously, such beauty comes with a great weight to carry. And that was the harassment Himemiya-san received from boys who wanted her to be their girlfriend. Throughout the first year, she received confessions from many boys almost every day. And on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, she was given so many chocolates that it was impossible for her to hold them all with both hands.</p>

<p>However, Himemiya-san never accepted the feelings of her suitors, and all the confessions she received were rejected.</p>

<p>Because of this, the much-desired princess has another nickname behind the scenes. And that is &lsquo;The Cruel Goddess&rsquo;. This was the result of having generated bitterness and pain among the broken hearts of her suitors.</p>

<p>&mdash;Uh&hellip; This is so unfair&hellip; &mdash; Himemiya-san sighed for the umpteenth time as she leaned on the table.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have seen Himemiya-san looking so lazy and depressed. It&rsquo;s not the kind of attitude she usually shows at school, so I guess you can understand my astonishment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I were to take a picture of her and sell it to the boys who are madly in love with her, I could probably make a lot of money.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuto-kun, the order of pancakes with honey and coffee with milk is ready. Please take it to the customer.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, yes, I&rsquo;ll be right there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hearing the manager&rsquo;s voice coming from the kitchen, I came back to reality. I&rsquo;d better hurry up with this&hellip;</p>

<p>After hearing the manager&rsquo;s voice coming from the kitchen, I brought my consciousness back to reality and received the food to bring to the customer. Huh, maybe I should bring this&hellip;</p>

<p>The place I&rsquo;m at is a restaurant called &ldquo;Marble&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been working here part time before the school semester starts. The second year of high school is about to start in a week, so for me, who usually doesn&rsquo;t do anything productive, it&rsquo;s better than nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Himemiya-san had ordered the fluffy pancakes, they are very popular here, and no wonder. The manager is a very good cook, and most of the customers who visit the restaurant come here exclusively for that reason.</p>

<p>Therefore, I guess Himemiya-san would be a regular customer here too&hellip; Right?</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufu, she has been coming here for a long time, but this must be the first time you met her though, right? Well, you&rsquo;re in luck, besides, she&rsquo;s a very popular girl, since she started coming here, the sales of the restaurant have increased a lot.</p>

<p>The manager smiles as she says those words.</p>

<p>&mdash;Now, Yuto-kun, let&rsquo;s stop the banal conversations and quickly deliver the food. And be careful not to offend the goddess of this cafeteria, she attracts good luck. got it?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, I understand.</p>

<p>I took the tray and went to the table where Himemiya-san was sitting, needless to say how nervous I was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She continued to lie on the table as if she hadn&rsquo;t returned from her world of laziness. Obviously, it makes me a little happy to know that she has that side. But so as not to make her uncomfortable, I made an effort to suppress that emotion and speak to her very properly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sorry to keep you waiting, here&rsquo;s your order.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, thank you&hellip; It looks delicious, especially the whipped cream&hellip; Hey, do you mind if I take a picture?</p>

<p>Himemiya-san raised her head vigorously, watched me for a moment, but then her eyes were captivated by the pancakes.</p>

<p>The sparkle was noticeable in her pearly eyes, and a rapt expression invaded her face as she pointed her phone&rsquo;s camera at the food.</p>

<p>But for some strange reason she wouldn&rsquo;t press the shutter. I wonder what&rsquo;s wrong with her, could it be that he can&rsquo;t concentrate because I&rsquo;m around?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, I hope he enjoys his meal.</p>

<p>I bowed and turned on my heel. Even though we are classmates, she doesn&rsquo;t recognize me. It&rsquo;s kind of sad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey&hellip; Um, is it okay if I take a picture?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s weird. According to the manager, Himemiya-san is a regular customer, I think she should know by now that she&rsquo;s allowed to take pictures in the cafeteria. Or is she the type of person who asks for permission every time she comes here? I guess she is a very disciplined girl after all.</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course, you are free to take as many pictures as you want.</p>

<p>The power of internet advertising is immeasurable. I personally don&rsquo;t have adequate knowledge about whether Himemiya-san is using any famous social network, but if she does post such a photo on the internet, I&rsquo;m sure there will be people lining up at this place every day.</p>

<p>If that happens, obviously, sales will increase, the manager will be happy, and I will get a pay raise. It&rsquo;s a win-win all the way around.</p>

<p>&mdash;Um&hellip; Can I ask you one more thing?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, what do you want?</p>

<p>&mdash;Could you keep it a secret that I come to this place, Okugawa-kun? &mdash; she said while smiling with her cheeks dyed slightly red.</p>

<p>Huh? Does she really know who I am? No&hellip; It must be a mistake, I don&rsquo;t think the person in front of me is the same girl who in high school has many related nicknames about how to make a man&rsquo;s heart bitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have never seen a smile as sweet as hers.</p>

<p>&mdash;And one more thing&hellip; Could you take a picture of me? I&rsquo;m not good at taking selfies, so I&rsquo;d like you to help me with that, Okugawa-kun&hellip; Or don&rsquo;t you perform that kind of service?</p>

<p>Please, Himemiya-san, could you stop adding requests? But I had no choice but to nod my head silently without adding any comments.</p>

<p>Inevitably I saw the manager smiling at the counter out of the corner of my eye. It&rsquo;s okay, I don&rsquo;t care what she might be thinking about this.</p>

<p>&mdash;Okay, I&rsquo;ll take the picture if you want me to, but I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&hellip;..</p>

<p>&mdash;Yay! Thank you, Okugawa-kun!</p>

<p>Before I could warn her that I&rsquo;m not very skilled at taking pictures, Himemiya-san bounced in her seat happily and handed me her phone.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san&rsquo;s phone case is of the flip type, but the model itself was not what was interesting, but the particular design of a curious character with silver hair that has become very popular lately among various social circles.</p>

<p>For my part I recognized him and it was inevitable for me not to mutter his name.</p>

<p>&mdash;This character is perhaps&hellip; Ciel snow?</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh? Okugawa-kun knows Ciel-chan too? I mean&hellip; Do you like her too? &mdash; Himemiya-san asked while leaning forward.</p>

<p>Upon making such a move, her breasts swayed sharply, causing me to get a little nervous and unconsciously take a step backwards.</p>

<p>Ciel Snow is a V-Tuber who has become very popular lately. Her character design is of someone grown up, with beautiful snowy silver hair and fox ears. Her content is mainly dedicated to playing video games via streaming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason I know so much about said V-Tuber is not because I am a loyal follower, but because my sister is a huge fan, and whenever she starts her stream, she always goes to my room and takes over my PC and bed.</p>

<p>The other day at night she came up to me excitedly asking if I could give her money for her to donate so she could get Ciel Snow to play some video game with her. It&rsquo;s really quite an irresponsible attitude on her part, plus it&rsquo;s complicated to have to hide my money.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;ve recently started watching her, and I think she&rsquo;s really cute, I think I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with her. It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that watching Ciel-chan is my reason for living&hellip; Heck, why is she so cute!</p>

<p>Himemiya-san let out a sigh after finishing her explanation of love about a fictional character. I think it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to think that way, but in order not to create a conflict I decided to keep quiet and smile wryly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Now that you&rsquo;ve revealed your love for a V-Tuber, why don&rsquo;t we take the picture? The pancakes will be ruined if they get cold.</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh?! That&rsquo;s right! I forgot about the pancakes! Okugawa-kun, hurry up!</p>

<p>&mdash;Okay. Say, cheese.</p>

<p>Then I pressed the shutter and the photo was constantly generated on the phone&rsquo;s screen. Himemiya-san appeared in it with a big smile on her face while holding the plate with both hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it is worth noting that only her face was in focus and not the pancakes, this is because the facial recognition function of the camera as expected focused on her. So, it&rsquo;s not my fault.</p>

<p>&mdash;Himemiya-san, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to check the photo if it was taken correctly?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, it&rsquo;s perfect, thank you, Okugawa-kun.</p>

<p>For the first time in my young life, I discovered that when a beautiful girl smiles, it has a great destructive power for a man&rsquo;s mental health&hellip; And for my heart.</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/gashadokai.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/maiden-pic01.png?resize=770%2C1108&ssl=1" width= "345;" height= "480;"></img>

<p>&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ll get back to work, eat your pancakes before they get cold.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hmph. It&rsquo;s a little embarrassing to eat in front of a classmate, but I&rsquo;ll take your word for it.</p>

<p>Phew. With this I&rsquo;ve finally broken free. Talking to Himemiya-san, who is a girl as beautiful as a princess, is enough to make me feel like my sense of reason has completely vanished from my head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Good job, Yuto-kun. What did you think of the pretty girl in your class? She&rsquo;s very beautiful, right?</p>

<p>When I returned to the counter, the beautiful manager turned to me with a big smile on her face. Unlike Himemiya-san, the manager is also a very beautiful woman, but with the difference that she exudes a very mature sex appeal.</p>

<p>&mdash;I guess there&rsquo;s no need to say anything since you were eavesdropping. Also, how do you know Himemiya-san?</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, you know&hellip; Girls who are referred to as maidens tend to get along well. Despite our age difference, we&rsquo;re arguably the best of friends. &mdash; she replied as she folded her arms and with a triumphant smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I still find it hard to believe that a woman as beautiful as her is still single. And even more unbelievable is the fact that she still hasn&rsquo;t been able to get over her first love from high school, he must have been a great man for her to still be closed in her heart. No doubt about it, this world is strange.</p>

<p>As I was lost in my thoughts, the sound of the bell pierced my eardrums reaching deep into my brain, bringing me back to reality.</p>

<p>&mdash;So, this is the coffee shop that was so much rumored. It has a nice atmosphere.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, and I&rsquo;ve also heard it has a beautiful manager.</p>

<p>I clicked my tongue loudly in my mind. Two men who appeared to be college students entered the place, needless to say their appearances didn&rsquo;t give a good welcome in terms of wanting to interact with them.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Yuto-kun. In case of emergency, I&rsquo;m counting on you.</p>

<p>The manager, who was in a good mood, abruptly and suddenly changed her personality. In the hospitality industry, the customer should always be treated like a god. And this type of customer is the most problematic.</p>

<p>Although, for the manager it doesn&rsquo;t matter to her if the customer is a &ldquo;god&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re a person who infringes on the tranquility of the cafeteria, you can be sure that a painful death awaits you. Therefore, the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you&rdquo;, which I mentioned earlier, was a subliminal message to get rid of them in case something starts to go wrong.</p>

<p>A murderous aura begins to seep through the manager&rsquo;s body. At this point I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt whether the two college guys who entered the store are actually the real danger.</p>

<p>&mdash;Welcome, is it just the two of you? If so, please take a seat at one of the available tables.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, that now&hellip; Hey, look at that! That girl is very pretty!</p>

<p>One of the men notices Himemiya-san, who was tasting her pancakes with great pleasure. As a result of this fact, one of the guy&rsquo;s whistles at her and puts a strange expression on his face as they both proceed to approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hi cutie, are you alone? Would you like to eat with us?</p>

<p>&mdash;If you like, we can pay for your meal and get out of here to a more fun place, what do you say?</p>

<p>The attitude that both boys took did not please the manager at all. The simple fact of being at her establishment and trying to flirt with women and take them by force to another place is a despicable and not tolerated act.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuto-kun&hellip; Kill them. &mdash; Said the manager while gesturing with her thumb around her neck.</p>

<p>I let out a sigh and turned to Himemiya-san.</p>

<p>&mdash;Could you guys be a little quiet? Your annoying attitude is ruining the best pancakes I&rsquo;ve ever eaten.</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh?! You&rsquo;re so rude! Still, I like women who are hard to tame.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh, are you one of those tsundere? It would be nice to see when you take a submissive attitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As expected, the attitude the manager took gave a hint of her utter displeasure.</p>

<p>Even for me to hear that kind of comment was crossing a line. I&rsquo;m usually a mild-mannered person and try not to lose my temper when something bothers me. But, today was the exception. I have to intervene quickly before something bad can happen.</p>

<p>Or so I thought, because despite my worries, Himemiya-san grabbed a glass of water and without hesitation poured it on both men.</p>

<p>&mdash;I asked them to be quiet. Are they monkeys who can&rsquo;t understand human speech? Aah&hellip; Excuse me, I think it&rsquo;s an insult to monkeys to compare them to you.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san&rsquo;s reaction was somewhat excessive. I can understand her throwing water on them, which is not pleasant for anyone. But, provoking them with an insult wouldn&rsquo;t make things any less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the fact that she said it with a serious expression without a hint of remorse would only fan the flames of the problem. And this I can see for myself as both men&rsquo;s temples quiver with rage.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t think I won&rsquo;t do anything to you because you&rsquo;re a girl!</p>

<p>&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s time you learned a lesson. Come here!</p>

<p>&mdash;Kya!</p>

<p>Himemiya-san is grabbed by one of the men, who was very angry. And because of the scream she exhaled, it shows that even she was not prepared for the reaction of her harassers.</p>

<p>&mdash;Excuse me, customer, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t allow violence inside this establishment.</p>

<p>I positioned myself in front of one of the men, causing him to let go of Himemiya-san. I was currently in the middle of both of them.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey kid, stay out of this! This is between us and that woman! It&rsquo;s none of your business.</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s right! If you don&rsquo;t want us to hurt you, turn around and go back to work.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t allow conflict within this establishment. Let alone you disturbing other customers. This is not a place to pick up girls, it&rsquo;s a coffee shop. If you can&rsquo;t understand that, then I will ask you to leave&hellip; Even a monkey could understand that.</p>

<p>After saying that, I put a smile on my face and pointed at the exit to both men.</p>

<p>&mdash;You&hellip; You&hellip; You dare to mock us by calling us monkeys&hellip;?!</p>

<p>&mdash;You bast**d! Who do you think you are! Don&rsquo;t try to be a hero just because you&rsquo;re in front of a pretty girl!</p>

<p>Apparently, Himemiya-san and I hurt their pride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, one of the men raised his fist and directed it towards my face. Since Himemiya-san was behind me, I couldn&rsquo;t somehow dodge it&hellip; But I also didn&rsquo;t have the pleasure of taking a punch from a man for defending a beautiful girl. So, there was only one way out of this.</p>

<p>So, I used my left hand to deflect the trajectory of his fist, and in turn raised my right-hand heading towards his face&hellip; Of course, I didn&rsquo;t hit him. I stopped a few inches from his nose, and that made the man startle so much that he fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Silence fell over the cafeteria. Both men were speechless at the unexpected counterattack. On the other hand, Himemiya-san thought I was going to be hurt, but was so surprised by the turn of events that she put both hands to her mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the manager had a smile brimming with pride on her face.</p>

<p>&mdash;Even a monkey would be able to act rationally in a situation where it is overcome with anger. Please leave this establishment. And if you return to this place, I will not hold back&hellip; Understood?</p>

<p>&mdash;Understood! I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>

<p>Just like a couple of rabbits. The men left the cafeteria in a hurry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I exhaled all the air I was holding and shrugged my shoulders. This might appease the manager&rsquo;s tempers a bit, and the cafeteria would be a little quieter as a result.</p>

<p>After all, my father&rsquo;s advice that he left me still applies to this day. A man has to be strong enough to protect the people he cares about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so thankful I took those karate classes when I was a kid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;O&mdash;Okugawa-kun!</p>

<p>I suddenly felt a soft, lumpy touch on my back. That, adding the sweet scent I loved, made my brain melt.</p>

<p>It took me a few seconds to realize that the culprit was Himemiya-san who was hugging me from behind.</p>

<p>This is all quite confusing. Why is Himemiya-san hugging me? And why is her body shaking?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m so sorry. This is all my fault&hellip; Did they hurt you?</p>

<p>Himemiya-san addresses me in a soft and trembling voice. To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t concentrating on what she was saying to me, panic had taken over me. The prettiest and most beautiful girl in school was hugging me, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Okugawa-kun, are you okay? can you hear my voice? &mdash; she asked getting close to my ear&hellip;</p>

<p>Himemiya-san, excuse me, but for now I don&rsquo;t want you to worry about me, I just want you to get as far away as I can, it&rsquo;s impossible to think and look into your eyes when your breasts are on my back.</p>

<p>&mdash;Okay, you two. Save the flirting for when you&rsquo;re alone.</p>

<p>The manager clapped her palms together, causing Himemiya-san to come to her senses and turn away from me. Her face was as red as a tomato.</p>

<p>&mdash;Kanade-chan, are you okay? One of those guys grabbed your arm, does it hurt?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, I&rsquo;m fine. Okugawa-kun helped me right away. So, they didn&rsquo;t do anything to me.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that&hellip; Kanade-chan, no matter how upset you are, you can&rsquo;t just act on impulse and throw water at people like it&rsquo;s nothing. Just think about it, what do you think would have happened if Yuto-kun hadn&rsquo;t been here to help you&hellip;? You should think about it.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. &mdash; Himemiya-san replied while shrugging her shoulders. &mdash; I just&hellip; I wanted to eat the pancakes I had wanted so much, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but lose my temper&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;I see.</p>

<p>For a girl like her to be seen as a &ldquo;Maiden&rdquo;, and to lose her mind over something as banal as pancakes&hellip; It very much reflects that she&rsquo;s nothing more than a child. For my part, I averted my gaze since I couldn&rsquo;t look directly at her, my cheeks were burning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;What a remedy&hellip; Well, I&rsquo;m flattered that you want my pancakes so badly. So, as a special service, I&rsquo;ll make you some new ones, you must be really scared, and to get over this bad time, I want you to eat something delicious. What&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll give you toppings thanks.</p>

<p>&mdash;Really?! Thank you, manager!</p>

<p>Himemiya-san was so excited that she looked like a child being given a candy. Seeing her like this made the image she had of her as an unattainable Goddess, now only as that of a spoiled princess.</p>

<p>&mdash;By the way, Yuto-kun, your work schedule ends for today. You can go home.</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh? Why? I&rsquo;m not hurt, and I&rsquo;m physically fine.</p>

<p>Thanks to Himemiya-san, my heart is still beating like it&rsquo;s about to burst, but other than that, I&rsquo;m in remarkably good health. I&rsquo;m willing to work overtime today, let alone wish to go home early.</p>

<p>But the manager didn&rsquo;t seem to like the idea. When she heard my response, she shrugged and put her hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t act like a child. The men from earlier might be setting up an ambush somewhere, what do you think will happen? Are you planning to let Kanade-chan go home alone?</p>

<p>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think those two are going to do something stupid like that, in fact&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t contradict me. We adults always think of worst-case scenarios. So, Yuto-un, I want you to accompany Kanade-chan and then go home, got it?</p>

<p>I nodded involuntarily at the manager&rsquo;s pressure. This put doubts in my head. I doubt that she accepted out of fear of her&hellip; But there&rsquo;s something that sex appeal that dazzles make me act the way she wants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu. I&rsquo;m glad you understood, Yuto-kun. Then&hellip; You should prepare to leave immediately. Kanade-chan, sit down and wait for a bit, I&rsquo;ll bring you the pancakes right away.</p>

<p>The manager went back to the kitchen after saying that. Therefore, Himemiya-san and I were left alone, the atmosphere there turned out to be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Um&hellip; Okugawa-kun. So, you&rsquo;re going home early today?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, yeah, that&rsquo;s a pity, though after we leave here, I have the important task of getting you home safely.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, in that case, would you like to have pancakes with me? I&rsquo;ll have the manager make one for you too. My treat, of course. I want to thank you for what you did for me&hellip; &mdash; she said, as she had a slight blush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>She stared at me as if looking for my reaction to her invitation. Besides, her eyes were slightly moist. Is there any boy in this world who could refuse such a request coming from the most beautiful girl in the world? I doubt it&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do anything that deserved a thank you, but since you want to do it&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;You saved me from a dangerous situation. It&rsquo;s only natural that I want to thank you. I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you at my seat, so go change quickly.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Himemiya-san you&rsquo;re surprisingly insistent.</p>

<p>&mdash;Okugawa-kun, I hope you&rsquo;ll take this opportunity to realize that we girls have our secrets.</p>

<p>When my silly sister says things like that, I take it as a joke. But, when a pretty girl like her says it, it takes on a very different meaning. And sure enough, the temperature in my cheeks rose again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;.I get it. I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind. I&rsquo;ll go change then. But promise you&rsquo;ll wait for me, I don&rsquo;t want you to eat my pancakes first, okay?</p>

<p>Just like Himemiya-san, I love pancakes here too.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t promise you that. If you don&rsquo;t want me to eat it all, go change quickly and come back here. &mdash; she replied with a fearless smile on her lips.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today was the first time we had a conversation. And with everything that happened today, I&rsquo;ve come to understand her a little.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have one doubt, though. If she were to eat all the pancakes&hellip; Where in her body will all that food go? As if Himemiya-san read my head, she answered.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu. We women are not made to gain weight even if we eat a lot of sweets. Especially my case, and the nutritional content of the food I eat is going to&hellip; Well, I guess I&rsquo;ve talked too much already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said while deliberately hiding her breasts with both hands.</p>

<p>I see&hellip; So, that&rsquo;s where all that food goes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well. That makes a lot of sense&hellip; Although, being you, I wouldn&rsquo;t go around bragging that I can eat anything without getting a bit fat. You&rsquo;ll probably hurt a lot of women out there and they&rsquo;ll turn against you.</p>

<p>And among those women is my cute, lovely sister who would shed tears of blood if she hears that.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</p>


<p>&mdash;So, Yuto-kun. It&rsquo;s clear that you must protect Kanade-chan, right?</p>

<p>It was nice to be able to eat together with Himemiya-san. Although the manager was watching us the whole time with a smile on her face. And I couldn&rsquo;t taste the flavor of the berries at ease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not to mention that Himemiya-san was greedily looking at my pancakes made it more uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;I know, you don&rsquo;t have to repeat it. More importantly, are you going to be okay alone?</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I asked for help from a high school student who had some free time. I used to run this establishment by myself before you arrived, Yuto-kun. I&rsquo;ll manage without you.</p>

<p>The manager puffs out her chest with a triumphant expression after saying those words. Well, to a certain extent I can trust that everything will be quiet while I&rsquo;m gone, the fact that we&rsquo;re talking in front of the store right now makes that fact clear.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t worry about me anymore! Just focus on getting Kanade-chan home safely, okay? If anything happens to her, I won&rsquo;t forgive you.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;I understand. One question, why do you care so much about her? This overprotective character is not very usual for you.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t make fun of me&hellip; But, in a way, I see myself mirroring her in my high school days. So, I can&rsquo;t help but want to support her.</p>

<p>High school days&hellip; Could it be because the manager was being treated the same way as Himemiya-san?</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Himemiya-san was reading a book and mumbling things about a prince&hellip; By the way, she&rsquo;s not here, she&rsquo;s still inside in the bathroom, otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t be having this conversation.</p>

<p>&mdash;Sorry for keeping you waiting, Okugawa-kun. &mdash; Himemiya-san said as she was leaving the cafeteria.</p>

<p>Hmm? Is it my idea or does she look more beautiful than a while ago?</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu. In that case, be very careful both of you. Kanade-chan, if anything happens, don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask Yuto-kun to protect you, got it?</p>

<p>&mdash;You&rsquo;re very overprotective, manager&hellip; But yes, I will. I&rsquo;ll also do my best to be sweet to Okugawa-kun!</p>

<p>&mdash;Wait&hellip; What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>I know that if the time comes to protect Himemiya-san, I&rsquo;ll do it. But I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll have the courage to endure her being sweet to me. Even more so if she presses her breasts against my body again.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuto-kun&hellip; Just because Kanade-chan is cute and pretty, don&rsquo;t go turning into a wolf and pounce on her.</p>

<p>&mdash;I would never do something like that! Who do you think I am?!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not the same as the couple of idiots who came into the cafeteria. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m some pervert who takes my classmates into alleys to molest them.</p>

<p>&mdash;What you&rsquo;re saying is sad, Okugawa-kun. Am I that unattractive?</p>

<p>Himemiya-san&rsquo;s words caught me off guard. How should I respond to something like that? If I tell her that she is attractive, surely the manager will throw me a dismissive look, and if I say no, Himemiya-san might get angry.</p>

<p>This is the exact definition of being under siege.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu, it&rsquo;s fun to play with Okugawa-kun, her expressions are not wasted.</p>

<p>&mdash;Do you think so too, Kanade-chan? At first glance he looks like a cold and emotionless man, but in reality he&rsquo;s a person with a hundred faces, just like you. Try to talk a lot on the way, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get to know interesting things about each other.</p>

<p>Listening to both women talk with wicked smiles on their faces was psychological torture for me.</p>

<p>I never imagined that these two could get along so well. It&rsquo;s like watching two demons planning their misdeeds against angels, and unfortunately, they have me in their sights&hellip; I need a break.</p>

<p>&mdash;Okugawa-kun, shall we go home now? Will you protect me all the way?</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll protect you very well, princess, even if you don&rsquo;t ask me to. &mdash; I replied while shrugging my shoulders and with a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>The image of Himemiya-san in my mind has become distorted. She has gone from being an unattainable maiden to a devilish princess who loves to tease people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Did you just call me a princess? Why would you say something like that all of a sudden&hellip;? You&rsquo;re a born womanizer, Okugawa-kun. It&rsquo;s not right for you to go around calling every girl you meet that way.</p>

<p>&mdash;Womanizer? I&rsquo;ve never had a girlfriend in my life. Stop making jokes that aren&rsquo;t funny.</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh? You&rsquo;ve never had a girlfriend? Means you&rsquo;re single?</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s right. Unlike Himemiya-san, my age is equal to the number of times I&rsquo;ve never had a girlfriend. And don&rsquo;t make me say it because it makes me sad, da** it.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&hellip; I&rsquo;m also the same as Okugawa-kun, my age is equal to the number of boyfriends I haven&rsquo;t had.</p>

<p>A priori it may sound unimportant, but this is a shocking statement. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that Himemiya-san hasn&rsquo;t had even one partner in her entire life.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re taking my advice and having a conversation, but from now on, do it on your way home, not in front of the cafeteria. And don&rsquo;t flirt in front of me, just like you, my age is the equivalent of how long I&rsquo;ve been single.</p>

<p>Sure, you&rsquo;ve been single because you&rsquo;re still not over your high school boyfriend&hellip; That&rsquo;s being single because you want to be, not because you can&rsquo;t stop being single.</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s right, if we keep talking here, we&rsquo;ll be obstructing the business. Okugawa-kun, walking.</p>

<p>&mdash;All right, let&rsquo;s&hellip; Eh?! Why are you holding my hand so suddenly?! And don&rsquo;t pull me like that, it&rsquo;s dangerous!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Be very careful.</p>

<p>The manager seemed to be enjoying the fact that I was now the plaything of a beautiful girl. She said goodbye to both of us and we walked away from the cafeteria.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san&rsquo;s house is about a 30-minute walk from this place. When I asked her if it wasn&rsquo;t annoying for her to have to walk so far, she said that this way she would work up an appetite, and if you plan to eat pancakes, that should be the goal, to have a big appetite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Okugawa-kun, how long have you been working part-time at the cafeteria? The manager seems to trust you a lot.</p>

<p>&mdash;I started working in the summer vacation. At first, I was going to do it for a short period of time, but the atmosphere turned out to be pleasant. The manager turned out to be a nice and cool person, so I decided to continue a little longer.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hmm&hellip; I thought Okugawa-kun was working at that place since he was attracted to women with the manager. But that&rsquo;s not the case, right?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why do you think that about me, Himemiya-san? Do you still think that I&rsquo;m a womanizer?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not really. But the truth is, it&rsquo;s weird that the manager, such a beautiful woman, is not married, let alone has a boyfriend.</p>

<p>I would like to tell Himemiya-san the reason why the manager doesn&rsquo;t have a partner, but I think it would be very inappropriate of me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Okugawa-kun, do you have someone like that in your life? Even if you don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, you must have at least experienced your first love, right?</p>

<p>&mdash;My first love in my life was a kindergarten teacher whose name and face I no longer remember, and it&rsquo;s been many years since I&rsquo;ve been in love, how about you, Himemiya-san?</p>

<p>&mdash;I see. In my case, I haven&rsquo;t even had my first love yet, so I can&rsquo;t say anything about it, but I know it&rsquo;s very painful. That&rsquo;s why I have to do whatever it takes to make it come true. &mdash; she replied with a serious look on her face and with her fist in the air &mdash; By the way, changing the subject, do you have any plans after this, Okugawa-kun?</p>

<p>&mdash;Something to do&hellip;? Not really, I&rsquo;m still supposed to be at work at this hour, I guess I&rsquo;ll just go back home.</p>

<p>&mdash;Then, why don&rsquo;t you stay at my place for a while? I want you to stay for dinner as a thank you for saving my life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Huh?</p>

<p>I think I reacted in the most inappropriate way, but the shock got the better of me. I guess this doesn&rsquo;t count as a wolf attacking a defenseless damsel in an alley, does it, manager?</p>

<p>&mdash;Bu&hellip; But didn&rsquo;t you thank me by inviting me to eat pancakes with you? That was more than enough.</p>

<p>&mdash;The pancakes were cooked by the manager, right? So, in theory I haven&rsquo;t thanked you properly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, actually&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;And not only did you save me, but you&rsquo;re also walking me home. That means I should thank you twice as much, please Okugawa-kun, stay at my house.</p>

<p>I was pressured by Himemiya-san&rsquo;s impetus, my hands were tied, so I had no choice but to nod and accept her invitation. I guess I will be able to enjoy the bliss of spending more time with her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Perfect, then, could you tell me what your favorite food is, Okugawa-kun?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why do you want to know? What are you up to&hellip;? And I like hamburgers.</p>

<p>&mdash;You complain, but you keep answering my questions, how cute&hellip; You&rsquo;re not a tsundere by any chance? It&rsquo;s kind of cute that you&rsquo;re playing hard to get. You&rsquo;re like a cat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Himemiya-san covers her mouth and smiles gracefully. Her figure is as beautiful and elegant as that of a noblewoman in a painting. When I&rsquo;m with her, I feel like I&rsquo;m floating in the clouds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;By the way, the reason I asked about your favorite food is because I&rsquo;m going to stop by the supermarket to do some shopping for dinner.</p>

<p>&mdash;Are you really going to do that?</p>

<p>&mdash;Sure, I&rsquo;ll prepare a delicious home-cooked meal for y-o-u.</p>

<p>With a triumphant look, Himemiya-san puffed out her chest, and as a result, they swayed and I involuntarily turned my head elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This girl will make my heart explode&hellip;</p>
