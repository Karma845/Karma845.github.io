<h3>Chapter 3: A New semester full of Turbulences</h3>


<p>&mdash;Yuu-nii! Hurry and get up! What are you still doing asleep? We&rsquo;re going to be late and you&rsquo;ll make me look like an irresponsible girl!</p>

<p>&mdash;Why don&rsquo;t you leave me alone and go ahead by yourself? It&rsquo;s still early, there&rsquo;s still a lot of time before school.</p>

<p>Our house is about a 15-minute walk to school. So, it&rsquo;s not a crazy distance, and even more so if you&rsquo;re on a bike. So, I can leave the house at a relatively flexible time, and it gives me time to read the horoscope in the morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;You don&rsquo;t understand, Yuu-nii! It&rsquo;s very important to get to school early because then we&rsquo;ll have time to find out who our new classmates will be!</p>

<p>That didn&rsquo;t matter to me at all. I was more interested in making the most of my time in bed than going to school early to get acquainted with strangers.</p>

<p>&mdash;You&rsquo;re so uninterested, that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t have any friends! Have you forgotten how that song goes? I want to have a million friends, so I can sing louder&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s none of your business. Besides, I&rsquo;d rather have one best friend I can trust than a million strangers.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hmm, I admit you have a good point&hellip; Still, it&rsquo;s not just about that! You have to be a caring brother who&rsquo;s willing to walk his sister all the way to high school, don&rsquo;t you think the same way I do?!</p>

<p>How come you have so much energy so early in the day? Little sisters are very scary&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;All right! I&rsquo;ll be ready in a minute. Give me some privacy.</p>

<p>The new school year had only started three days ago. I still don&rsquo;t understand what Matsuri&rsquo;s immediate need is in wanting to make friends in her first week of school. Besides, she&rsquo;s a very outgoing girl, I have no doubt that she will be able to make friends very easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, what is her real goal?</p>

<p>While I was thinking about it and putting on my tie, the doorbell of the house suddenly rang, this was a clear indication that a visitor had just been pronounced. But&hellip; Who would come so early to visit?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuu-nii, I&rsquo;m a bit busy, could you get that?</p>

<p>&mdash;Haa&hellip; I guess I have no choice.</p>

<p>After fixing my tie, I hurried to the front door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry to keep you waiting&hellip; Ah, it&rsquo;s you.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good&hellip; Good morning, Yuuto-san!</p>

<p>As soon as I opened the door, a girl in a blazer uniform and a pure white skirt was standing in front of me. Her shoulder-length, semi-long, shiny silver-colored hair caught the attention of anyone who saw her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s so beautiful she looks like she stepped out of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning, Noel-chan. What are you doing here so early in the morning?</p>

<p>This Dream Girl&rsquo;s name is Yumeno Noel. She and Matsuri are best friends and went to the same elementary and middle school together. Since Matsuri and I became step-siblings, I&rsquo;ve seen her come to this house many times and even played with the both of them.</p>

<p>However, she is much smarter than Matsuri. The private school she attends is one of the most famous prep schools in the country, and Noel is a true beauty prodigy who was admitted there at the top of her class.</p>

<p>&mdash;I came to say good morning to Yuuto-san. Did I do something wrong?</p>

<p>&mdash;Ah, no&hellip; Don&rsquo;t think like that.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not fair to ask me that question when I&rsquo;m teary-eyed. It&rsquo;s impossible to say no, even though she took the trouble to visit me even if she risks being late for school.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hehehehe. I knew Yuuto-san would say that! In that case, I&rsquo;ll come every morning to wish you good morning from now on.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eh&hellip; Every morning? That&rsquo;s a bit exaggerated&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course, every morning. I don&rsquo;t mind at all! I&rsquo;ll be very happy to see you, Noel-chan!</p>

<p>I had no choice but to succumb to her silent pressure. It seemed that hearing that made her very happy, as she smiled happily at me. I guess it all ended up being a success.</p>

<p>&mdash;Noel-chan, good morning!</p>

<p>I heard Matsuri&rsquo;s voice coming from inside the house, and before I knew it, she ran past me and hugged Noel-chan.</p>

<p>&mdash;Guhehe&hellip; Noel-chan, your breasts are as big today as ever! They&rsquo;re the best!</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Matsuri-chan&hellip;?! It&rsquo;s embarrassing that you&rsquo;re doing it in front of Yuuto-san&hellip; And don&rsquo;t touch me like that&hellip;! Please&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, hey&hellip; The fact that you&rsquo;re reacting like that just makes me want to touch you even more!</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/gashadokai.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2.png?resize=770%2C1108&ssl=1" width= "345;" height= "480;"></img>

<p>&mdash;Stop acting like that! Don&rsquo;t sexually harass your best friend, let alone in front of our house&hellip;</p>

<p>I was so angry that I hit Matsuri on the head with my hand and then pushed her away from Noel-chan&hellip; Damn, I don&rsquo;t understand why she acts like that&hellip; Although it&rsquo;s not the first time she&rsquo;s done it. But things are different now, she&rsquo;s in high school now and she has to learn how to behave, or Noel-chan will get sick of her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Mou! I was enjoying Noel-chan&rsquo;s breasts before you interrupted me, Yuu-nii.</p>

<p>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care what you want! Stop acting like a sexual predator&hellip;! I&rsquo;m so sorry, Noel-chan.</p>

<p>&mdash;It&rsquo;s okay&hellip; I&rsquo;m already used to Matsuri-chan touching me.</p>

<p>Noel-chan&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed with a bitter smile as soon as she responded to my apology. I bet she feels very embarrassed, but she has no choice but to restrain herself. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for my sister to take advantage of her kindness like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t believe anything he said, Noel-chan. Yuu-nii acts like he&rsquo;s a saintly knight. But the truth is, he really wants to touch your breasts too, don&rsquo;t you, Yuu-nii? Be honest!</p>

<p>Matsuri punches me in the side with a vulgar smile on her face.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I&rsquo;ve never wanted to squeeze Noel-chan&rsquo;s pair of big, marshmallow-soft breasts. But she&rsquo;s like another sister to me, so such insolence is not acceptable.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m really sorry about Matsuri&rsquo;s attitude, Noel-chan.</p>

<p>&mdash;No&hellip; It&rsquo;s okay&hellip; Umm, Yuuto-san&hellip; If you want it that much&hellip; You can touch my breasts&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Huh?</p>

<p>&mdash;It&rsquo;s exactly what you heard&hellip; If you want to feel them so much, Yuuto-san. You&rsquo;re always welcome to do it! I&rsquo;d rather you touch me than read hentai&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;S&hellip; Stop! Don&rsquo;t say any more, Noel-chan! More importantly&hellip; Why would you say something like that?!</p>

<p>Why the hell does this girl say those kinds of things so suddenly! And her face is even redder than before, though, her eyes denoted seriousness in her words.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Wait a minute, Noel-chan. Judging by your tone of voice&hellip; Do you also know about the existence of my precious collection?</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course, she does. Noel-chan asked me what kind of girl you like, so I told her&hellip; &mdash; replied Matsuri with a blunt expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I consider myself to be a very relaxed person who is not prone to losing my temper. But there&rsquo;s only so much I&rsquo;m willing to put up with&hellip; And this was one of them.</p>

<p>&mdash;Kyaaa! Matsuri-chan, stop it! You promised you were going to keep it a secret!</p>

<p>However, Noel-chan, who was even more distressed than me, was so full of embarrassment that she was waving her hands violently and not only was her face already as red as a tomato, but her neck as well.</p>

<p>&mdash;Noel-chan, you can&rsquo;t stay in the shadows forever, if you don&rsquo;t attack at the right time, someone else will beat you to it and you&rsquo;ll have lost your chance!</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh? Matsuri-chan, what do you mean by that&hellip; Are you trying to tell me that Yuuto-san already has a girlfriend&hellip;?</p>

<p>Noel-chan&rsquo;s eyes darkened as she stared blankly into nothingness. I must admit that seeing her like that makes her look cute, I could spend all my time looking at her without getting tired of it. But today wasn&rsquo;t going to be that day, as I can&rsquo;t afford to be late.</p>

<p>&mdash;Let&rsquo;s clear some things up. Noel-chan, don&rsquo;t be swayed by Matsuri&rsquo;s words. I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, so don&rsquo;t worry.</p>

<p>After saying that, I walked over to her and stroked her head. It&rsquo;s quite sad to have to admit out loud that I don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hmm, Yuu-nii&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry to inform you that that will only have the opposite effect on Noel-chan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what Matsuri is talking about, it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve stroked Noel-chan&rsquo;s head, I&rsquo;m sure everything will be fine.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hehehehe. I like the way it feels when you pet my head, Yuuto-san. Please don&rsquo;t stop.</p>

<p>Huh, I guess I was wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was finally smiling with a bright red face. It was like watching a kitten being petted by its owner. I really don&rsquo;t want to stop doing it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, well, that&rsquo;s enough. Yuu-nii come to your senses, and you too, Noel-chan! We have to go to class and we&rsquo;re going to be late.</p>

<p>Matsuri hit Noel-chan with her hand sword. As cruel as it may seem, it turns out to be quite effective.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ugh&hellip; That hurts, Matsuri-chan. If you&rsquo;re going to do that again, do it softer&hellip;.</p>

<p>&mdash;Shut up. If I don&rsquo;t do it hard, then you&rsquo;ll never get out of your delusional world! If you stay in there too long it can be very harmful! Besides, it&rsquo;s already getting late.</p>

<p>While Matsuri was scolding Noel-chan, I took a moment to look at the time on my phone, and it was past 7:30 am.</p>

<p>Time is certainly running out, but luckily, our high school is very close to our home. That also includes Noel-chan, since the place where she studies is also about a ten-minute walk away.</p>

<p>&mdash;It&rsquo;s all Matsuri-chan&rsquo;s fault for sexually harassing me! If it wasn&rsquo;t for you, I could have had a little more time with Yuuto-san&hellip;!</p>

<p>&mdash;Noel-chan is right, it&rsquo;s all Matsuri&rsquo;s fault. You should give it some thought.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you both think you&rsquo;re being a little unfair?</p>

<p>No, unfair is that you wake me up early in the morning forcing us to leave early for school, but then you&rsquo;d rather waste mine and Noel-chan&rsquo;s time with one of your silly pranks&hellip; I can&rsquo;t say that in such a voice, though.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, Noel-chan, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re going to be very busy in your new student environment, but you&rsquo;re still free to come visit whenever you want. It would make Matsuri very happy that you two are still seeing each other and can play together.</p>

<p>&mdash;Thank you, Yuuto-san! I&rsquo;ll take your word for it and when I have free time, I&rsquo;ll come visit&hellip; Are we still going to have sleepovers on weekends again?</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course. No more staying up all night though, okay?</p>

<p>&mdash;Booo&hellip; That takes the fun out of it, come on, let&rsquo;s have another game of all-night endurance!</p>

<p>Noel-chan tugged on my shirt sleeve while pulling her head closer on me, as if she was a cat looking to be petted. It&rsquo;s really tempting to want to do that&hellip; But I&rsquo;m going to have to fight those urges.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how good that is. The last time we did it, Noel-chan couldn&rsquo;t hold off sleep in the wee hours of the morning and then cuddled up to me using me as a pillow. It was a difficult night for me&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;I told you before and I&rsquo;ll tell you again. If you want to be pampered so much, be direct, Noel-chan! With Yuu-nii, hints don&rsquo;t work, it&rsquo;s like talking to a clam.</p>

<p>&mdash;It&rsquo;s easy for you to say when Yuuto-san is your Onii-chan, Matsuri-chan. &mdash; Noel replied while her eyes were moist and her cheeks were puffy.</p>

<p>The destructive power represented by her image right now is truly extraordinary. And when a pretty girl like her does it, her power of tenderness increases to stratospheric levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but look away. If I had a stepsister as pretty as she is, I would have long ago succumbed to my carnal desires.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, we&rsquo;ll have a strategy meeting about that later. Now I have to go to school or I&rsquo;ll be late.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, we have to go too or we&rsquo;ll be late. Besides, we don&rsquo;t want you to be late for class.</p>

<p>&mdash;Thanks&hellip; And sorry for all the inconvenience this morning. I&rsquo;ll call you tonight, Matsuri-chan. Yuuto-san, it was a pleasure to have been able to talk to you, even if it was for a short period of time. I look forward to seeing you again.</p>

<p>After having tilted her head forward, Noel-chan extended her hand upwards and just as if she had given the signal to someone, in a matter of seconds a luxurious black car stopped in front of our house.</p>

<p>And without hesitation, Noel-chan proceeded to get into the car.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, it&rsquo;s time for me to go, Yuuto-san.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes. Be very careful, okay?</p>

<p>From the window, Noel-chan waved her hand with an affectionate smile just like a goddess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;I think we&rsquo;d better leave now.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;I agree.</p>

<p>Both Matsuri and I were trembling at the great financial power of the Yumeno family. This is the first time we discovered that crucial part of their personal life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</p>


<p>Today I learned how important it is to prepare everything in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all the commotion we had this morning at home, it was a little after eight o&rsquo;clock when Matsuri and I walked through the school gates. I don&rsquo;t want to be late again until I graduate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;You should be grateful to me, Yuu-nii. If I hadn&rsquo;t told you to get ready early, you&rsquo;d still be home right now.</p>

<p>Matsuri puffed out her chest and put her hands under it as if trying to show off her lethal weapons. But it was still unfortunate, as they seem to be more cute instead of something that instills fear. It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re equally developed as Noel-chan or Himemiya-san.</p>

<p>&mdash;By the way, Yuu-nii, in the class you&rsquo;re in, is Himemiya-san there too? Have you talked to her? Has a romantic comedy started between the two of you already?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh dear little sister. Reality is not as sweet as you think. It&rsquo;s only in light novels and manga that such situations happen when a man helps a damsel in distress.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Oh, it&rsquo;s a pity you think so. In that case, I&rsquo;m ready to start whenever you&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>Suddenly a rather peculiar voice was heard behind me. As soon as I turned around to corroborate whose it was, I found Himemiya-san, who was standing with a beautiful, elegant smile on her face.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning, Okugawa-kun. Who&rsquo;s that pretty girl next to you? She looks like a new student&hellip; Is she your girlfriend?</p>

<p>Himemiya-san watches Matsuri with an anxious expression on her face.</p>

<p>As a result, Matsuri hid behind me while trembling. Maybe she&rsquo;s scared by Himemiya-san&rsquo;s sudden appearance.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning, Himemiya-san. This is my sister, her name is Okugawa Matsuri. Hey, Matsuri, don&rsquo;t hide and greet Himemiya-san properly.</p>

<p>&mdash;Nice to meet you&hellip; My name is Okugawa Matsuri, and what I adore the most is my brother Yuuto and V-Tuber Ciel-chan&hellip;.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufu, thank you for your kindness. My name is Himemiya Kanade. Okugawa-kun and I have become classmates this year, so it&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you too, Matsuri-chan.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san holds out her hand to Matsuri with a smile on her face. Even her casual gestures are very colorful, things like that make her a beautiful girl.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Yuu-nii. Can I ask you something?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hm? What&rsquo;s wrong?</p>

<p>While tugging on my sleeve, Matsuri asked quietly in my ear so Himemiya-san wouldn&rsquo;t hear me.</p>

<p>&mdash;Did you really go to this big-breasted beautiful girl&rsquo;s house and had her cook for you?</p>

<p>Seriously, what&rsquo;s the need to ask something like that right now? Although I suppose I can understand the doubts this raises for you. Himemiya-san is some kind of Goddess, and for her to have done something like that with a guy like me is beyond belief.</p>

<p>&mdash;What&rsquo;s your point, dear sister?</p>

<p>&mdash;You know the saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame for a man if he doesn&rsquo;t eat when the table is set&rdquo;? I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve been dining with such a beautiful, big-breasted woman. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of tastes you have anymore, Yuu-nii!</p>

<p>&mdash;I really didn&rsquo;t understand anything you just said&hellip;</p>

<p>This morning hasn&rsquo;t stopped being somewhat chaotic. And Matsuri is responsible for it. Also, the belief that she has several screws loose in her head is getting stronger than not.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu. Okugawa-kun really gets along well with your little sister.</p>

<p>The fact that Himemiya-san is smiling amusedly with her hand over her mouth suggests that Matsuri&rsquo;s comments apparently didn&rsquo;t reach her ears.</p>

<p>&mdash;My little brother is cute, but Matsuri-chan is no less so. And she&rsquo;s a fan of Ciel-chan, right? Can I take her home with me?</p>

<p>Himemiya-san licks her lips as she gazes at Matsuri with the eyes of a predator that has spotted its prey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Sure, you can do that. But after school.</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuu-nii?! Are you selling me out?!</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t worry, Matsuri-chan, I won&rsquo;t do anything bad to you. I just want you to watch Ciel-chan&rsquo;s streams with me and tell me all your stories! Especially the ones about your brother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While saying that, Himemiya-san winks at Matsuri. I don&rsquo;t like the sound of that&hellip; The things that can come out of her mouth sure can be scary&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;.I see, so that&rsquo;s what this is about. I&rsquo;ll gladly do it.</p>

<p>Matsuri&rsquo;s expression became as sharp as that of a Samurai ready to go to his death upon hearing Himemiya-san&rsquo;s proposal. I guess with that exchange of words the two of them already hit it off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufu. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re so insightful. I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with you from now on, Matsuri-chan.</p>

<p>&mdash;Thank you very much. I didn&rsquo;t expect Himemiya-san to be a carnivore despite her appearance.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a carnivore. I just don&rsquo;t like to miss a good feast when it&rsquo;s right in front of me.</p>

<p>The two proceed to shake hands firmly while carrying on an uneasy conversation.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, we&rsquo;ll talk more later, Matsuri-chan, it&rsquo;s time for us to get to class, or we&rsquo;ll be in trouble. Let&rsquo;s talk more calmly another time, okay?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, with pleasure! See you later, Yu-nii! &mdash; exclaimed Matsuri as she walked away from us.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good that she&rsquo;s so cheerful and has a lot of pep, but it would be much better if she knew how and when to use it.</p>

<p>&mdash;So, Okugawa-kun, shall we go to class together? Will you accompany me like the other day?</p>

<p>The next thing Himemiya-san did was to hold out her hand for me to take. If this were a Hollywood movie, I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take her hand very gracefully&hellip; But it&rsquo;s obvious what will happen if I do that.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense and walk, Himemiya-san.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Hmm? Won&rsquo;t my prince take my hand?</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a prince, and if we were to walk together holding hands, I doubt I&rsquo;d make it to the end of the year at this school.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san is the most popular girl in the whole school. If people see me walking with her holding hands, it would create panic and hatred among all the students in the school, regardless of whether they are male or female.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And as is obvious, I will be everyone&rsquo;s target, that person they will want to see hanging in the schoolyard.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re overreacting a bit? Besides, you have nothing to worry about. If Okugawa-kun gets in trouble for walking hand in hand with me, I&rsquo;ll be willing to protect you.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;May I ask how exactly you will protect me?</p>

<p>&mdash;By claiming you as my first love and prince, isn&rsquo;t it obvious? If anyone tries to do anything to you, I&rsquo;ll hug you on the spot and shout at the top of my lungs that you belong to me, so no one can hurt you&hellip; Hey, Okugawa-kun, where are you going? I haven&rsquo;t finished my explanation.</p>

<p>Seeing Himemiya-san telling her fantasy story with flushed cheeks and fidgeting nervously&hellip; The situation&rsquo;s not very cute to say the least. And I don&rsquo;t want to have to listen to situations that will never happen either.</p>

<p>&mdash;What a terrible prince you are, leaving your princess behind without any protection&hellip; Weren&rsquo;t you a Tsundere, Okugawa-kun? It&rsquo;s okay, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, that makes you more attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;What the hell are you talking about, Himemiya-san?</p>

<p>The image of Himemiya Kanade that had formed in my mind over the past year is crumbling. Well, it had already happened after the incident at the coffee shop.</p>

<p>&mdash;I mean that the hero, who is usually very shy, only shows his sweetness in front of the heroine, and that&rsquo;s why I think you&rsquo;re very moe&hellip;</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand what Himemiya-san is trying to say&hellip; But if I allow this conversation to continue to escalate, there will be no going back and the situation will get out of control. So, I simply ignored her and went back to the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Wait a minute, Okugawa-kun&hellip;.! Okay, don&rsquo;t listen to my fantasy, just don&rsquo;t leave me!</p>

<p>Himemiya-san starts running after me while shouting with a tone of voice like she&rsquo;s about to burst into tears.</p>

<p>If I was a cool guy from a shoujo manga, I would have shrugged my shoulders and walked beside her, but unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not that kind of character, so I went to the classroom running away like a rabbit.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</p>


<p>I was pretty exhausted from everything that had happened since the morning started, so as soon as I got to my desk, I just let myself drop without wanting to think any more. We&rsquo;re not even halfway through the school year yet, and I already felt like I had used up all my mental strength I had in reserve&hellip;</p>

<p>As I was sinking into my misery, a boy sat down across from me and then turned around to greet me.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning, it&rsquo;s unusual for Yuuto to be on time for class. Did anything interesting happen this morning?</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning, Juri&hellip; Well, you could say so. I&rsquo;m really tired.</p>

<p>&mdash;That sounds like a real mess. &mdash; Juri replied with a chuckle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This person is Takanashi Juri, one of my few friends, and he was also my classmate last year.</p>

<p>Juri&rsquo;s appearance is really curious, he has a slim build and his thin shoulders, along with his neutral face makes him to be mistaken for a girl, even if he is wearing pants.</p>

<p>However, despite his appearance, he is usually a very frank person, and has such a direct personality that he makes people uncomfortable. But that doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all.</p>

<p>&mdash;If I had to bet, I&rsquo;d say Matsuri-chan is responsible for it, right? She loves you very much, that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s always looking for ways to get your attention.</p>

<p>Juri knows Matsuri due to the fact that he has visited my house many times, and naturally, the two of them met and quickly hit it off. Also, us having the same tastes in manga helped a lot.</p>

<p>&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t expect Matsuri-chan to be willing to study at the same high school as you. With how smart she is, wasn&rsquo;t it a natural thing for her to study in a better place?</p>

<p>Juri is right. Despite Matsuri&rsquo;s childish and careless attitude, she is a very smart girl. So much so, that her former teacher firmly believed that if she sat for the exams of the most prestigious high school in our city, she would be accepted without any problems.</p>

<p>&mdash;I think you&rsquo;re confusing things a bit, Juri. In any case, if Matsuri is chasing anyone, it&rsquo;s you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being objective and looking at it from a big brother point of view. Juri and Matsuri have similar interests and are very close, I don&rsquo;t doubt that they can be a good match.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ha&hellip; You&rsquo;re beyond repair, Yuuto. You&rsquo;re insensitive&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure Matsuri-chan is having a hard time with you.</p>

<p>&mdash;Huh&hellip;? What do you mean by that? I feel like I&rsquo;ve been made fun of, or is it just my imagination?</p>

<p>&mdash;Haha. It&rsquo;s just your imagination. I can&rsquo;t make fun of Yuuto, can I? More importantly, there&rsquo;s something I want to ask you&hellip; Did something happen during spring break?</p>

<p>Saying that, Juri approached my face with a fearless smile. Although the expression in his eyes denoted seriousness, as if he was hiding a demon within them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn&rsquo;t feel scared, this felt like some kind of interrogation instead of a question.</p>

<p>&mdash;Why are you acting like this all of a sudden? I didn&rsquo;t do anything interesting, besides going out with you&mdash;&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;Yuuto, don&rsquo;t lie to me. I heard that you were seen talking mysteriously with the Goddess of Amanortisu, is that true? Did something happen between you two?</p>

<p>Juri asks without hesitation, and the expression on his face was blunt, as if telling me that he was not going to allow me to deceive him in any way. I guess my plan to keep what happened between Himemiya-san and I a secret can&rsquo;t be carried out.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Okugawa-kun, why are you staying silent? Come on, tell Takanashi-kun that during spring break you went to my house for dinner.</p>

<p>While I was trying to think of the safest way to answer Juri&rsquo;s question, I heard a peculiar voice behind me. Needless to say, the owner of that voice was Himemiya-san. And as was inevitable I inescapably shouted in my head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey&hellip;? Did you have dinner at Himemiya-san&rsquo;s house? Hey, Yuuto, weren&rsquo;t you planning to tell me about it? Since when did you and Himemiya-san have that kind of relationship? I&rsquo;m really curious.</p>

<p>My best friend put his arm around my shoulder with a big smile on his face, like a kid who just got a new toy.</p>

<p>And after Himemiya-san&rsquo;s big statement, as expected, all the boys in the class gave me looks of murderous intent mixed with jealousy. While the girls were curious about my love affair with her.</p>

<p>It was no exaggeration to say that my social life in high school will be determined by the kind of answers I give, so I simply turned my head desperately and did the law of ice.</p>

<p>However, Himemiya-san continued talking as if she was unaware of what was going on around her.</p>

<p>&mdash;Okugawa-kun helped me when I was in trouble because two guys wanted to take me by force to a place I didn&rsquo;t want, and to say thank you, I asked him to come to my house and I prepared dinner for him. And of course, I had to insist many times, as he wouldn&rsquo;t even let me thank him.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san shrugged her shoulders after saying that. She said everything and just as it happened, but why on earth is she showing signs of depression? You&rsquo;ll only be giving people the wrong ideas. They&rsquo;ll think I didn&rsquo;t want to be with you.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t think the wrong things, Juri! To begin with, the place where Himemiya-san got into trouble was at the coffee shop where I work, so as an employee, it&rsquo;s natural for me to help customers in need, right? That&rsquo;s why I told her that there was no need to thank me for it.</p>

<p>&mdash;And I told you many times that it wouldn&rsquo;t make me feel any better. Besides, I wanted to spend more time with you after dinner, but still&hellip; You left and left me all alone&hellip;..</p>

<p>Himemiya-san puts her hand on her cheek and while quoting those words with a sad expression on her face too. This girl is definitely doing it on purpose. She likes to see me in trouble. There&rsquo;s no doubt about it&hellip;.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, objectively speaking, Yuuto is not the type of person who goes to other people&rsquo;s homes and obediently eats whatever food they put on the table. You should have seen what he was like when he first visited my home and stayed to eat. Now, just imagine the most beautiful and popular girl in school asking him for something like that&hellip; Sometimes I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a coward or just a gentleman. But I guess that&rsquo;s one of the nice things about him.</p>

<p>What do you mean I&rsquo;m a coward? If I have to do it, well, I&rsquo;ll gladly do it&hellip; I just didn&rsquo;t think it would be a good idea to take advantage of the false feelings Himemiya-san was experiencing at the time.</p>

<p>Besides, that was the first time she and I formally interacted.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufu, it&rsquo;s just as you said, Takanashi-kun. As expected of my prin&mdash;&hellip;.</p>

<p>Before Himemiya-san could finish her words, the school bell rang announcing the start of the school day and the homeroom teacher, Isobe-sensei entered the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that, Himemiya-san sat in her seat with her cheeks puffed out in dissatisfaction due to the fact that she could not finish saying her sentence.</p>

<p>I guess I was able to overcome that awkward moment due to fate.</p>

<p>&mdash;Good morning everyone, before we begin class, I have a suggestion to make to you. How about at the end of the day we make a change as to which seats you would like to sit in for the rest of the year? That way you can get along better with each other and make friends with the new students.</p>

<p>If there was a chance anything could get worse. This was one of them.</p>

<p>It has only been three days since classes began, and the changes from the current seating arrangement is partly understandable. Since the first day we have all been seated randomly.</p>

<p>Or in other cases, there are people like Juri and I who have been great friends since freshman year, and we&rsquo;ve been sitting near each other ever since.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, since I don&rsquo;t hear any opposition, I&rsquo;ll call the roll and we&rsquo;ll do the seating change.</p>

<p>Saying that, Isobe-sensei began to read out the names of all the students in a high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>Most of the students were excited about this, particularly the boys, as they fantasized a lot about wanting to sit next to Himemiya-san.</p>

<p>&mdash;I hope we can still be close when we switch seats, Yuuto.</p>

<p>&mdash;Me too. We were close all last year, and I hope we&rsquo;ll be close again this year.</p>

<p>&mdash;Exactly. If you&rsquo;re close, I can manage if I forget to do my homework.</p>

<p>I take back what I said before. I hope you stay as far away from me as possible&hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</p>


<p>Lunchtime had arrived. And it didn&rsquo;t take long for trouble to appear.</p>

<p>I was surrounded by all my classmates because they were curious about what Himemiya-san had said this morning.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Okugawa-kun! Is it true that you saved Himemiya-san from some boys? Tell me in detail how you saved her!</p>

<p>&mdash;You had dinner at Himemiya-san&rsquo;s house, right? What kind of dish did she prepare for you? Was it delicious?!</p>

<p>Apparently, the girls are still being nice, so in order for them to keep that attitude with me, I just have to answer honestly to every single thing they ask me.</p>

<p>Although I can&rsquo;t help but feel worried, because if I let Himemiya-san continue to talk as openly as it happened earlier. I might get involved in more situations like this&hellip;</p>

<p>Luckily, she&rsquo;s not here right now, she left the classroom as soon as the bell for lunchtime rang.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you for Himemiya-san inviting you to her house to eat her home-cooked food, Okugawa! Uggh! How my heart aches!</p>

<p>&mdash;I see that I&rsquo;ll never have a chance to be with a pretty girl like Himemiya-san&hellip; I thought all it took was money, but I realized that just one guy as cool as Okugawa was enough&hellip; Damn it! I&rsquo;m doomed!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing worse than having to listen to whining from guys about how they feel worse because Himemiya-san noticed me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay to be angry all you want, but don&rsquo;t do it in front of me. And no matter how many times I try to explain to them, it will be futile, it will only make them more jealous and angrier. I guess I&rsquo;ll just ignore them.</p>

<p>&mdash;Excuse me! I&rsquo;m looking for my brother&hellip; Is Okugawa Yuuto here?</p>

<p>While I was thinking of a situation to get out of here and go to the cafeteria, just as if it was a miracle from the sky, Matsuri appeared, her tone of voice was mixed between nervousness and fear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And as a result, all the boys in the classroom turned to look at me at the same time.</p>

<p>&mdash;What&rsquo;s wrong, Matsuri?</p>

<p>My classmates, who had been making a lot of noise around me, seemed curious about the girl who had suddenly appeared in our classroom.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eeeh&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t expect Yu-nii to be such a popular person. I thought Juri-san was your only friend, at what point did you make so many friends?</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh at my stepsister&rsquo;s unkind words. I thought she was going to be my savior, but she turned out to be a much greater force of destruction. I need a break from all this&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hello, Matsuri-chan! I see you&rsquo;re still in the same mood as always.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hello, Juri-san! Or rather, Takanashi-senpai&hellip; Please take good care of my clumsy brother this school year.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;clumsy&rsquo; in high school. You&rsquo;ll bring down the whole image I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard to create&hellip; And don&rsquo;t ask me what kind of image that is either, because it&rsquo;ll make me feel worse.</p>

<p>&mdash;Don&rsquo;t worry about that! I will take care of Yuto as usual. Besides, you don&rsquo;t have to be so formal with me, you can call me whatever you like. By the way, Matsuri-chan, what brings you here? Do you have a problem?</p>

<p>&mdash;Not at all, everything is in order, I came here because I want to have lunch with Yuu-nii! But he seems to be a very popular person and he&rsquo;s busy right now.</p>

<p>Matsuri drops her shoulders and puts on a sad expression. Everyone around me is surprised at this fact. I have to do something fast.</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s not true, Matsuri! I&rsquo;m available, come on, let&rsquo;s go get something to eat together. Juri&rsquo;s coming too, right?</p>

<p>&mdash;Of course. Even though it&rsquo;s been a long time since the bell rang, there are probably no more seats available in the cafeteria.</p>

<p>Amanoritsu High School&rsquo;s cafeteria is very popular among the growing number of hungry students as well as the teaching staff, as their food is very affordable and the taste of the food is amazing.</p>

<p>Therefore, every day there is a battle for who manages to get a seat at this place.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu, don&rsquo;t worry about it, Juri-san, I&rsquo;ve taken care of reserving a table for 5 people today.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Matsuri, what do you mean by a table for 5 people? Will there be 2 others besides Juri, you and me?</p>

<p>&mdash;That answer will be answered as soon as we get to the cafeteria, Yu-nii. They&rsquo;re waiting for us right now, and it&rsquo;s no good wasting time like this, so let&rsquo;s hurry!</p>

<p>Matsuri took us by the hand and led us towards the cafeteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After we arrived at the cafeteria, all my doubts about who was waiting for us were cleared.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hello! I&rsquo;m Shiina Fumika, Kanade-chan&rsquo;s best friend. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you!</p>

<p>Shiina Fumika, you could say she was the celebrity of this high school. If Himemiya-san is a mature, cool and beautiful girl like a princess, Shiina-san is the opposite.</p>

<p>If I had to use one word to describe her, that would be&hellip; &lsquo;Legal Loli&rsquo;. Her features are adorable just like a baby&rsquo;s face, and her eyes were adorable just like a puppy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Besides that, her personality was charming, she always wore a smile on her face. But&hellip; There was something that made her very different from Himemiya, and that was her two large breasts, which as you can imagine, were much larger than those of the goddess of Amanoritsu.</p>

<p>As a result, the students came to nickname her &ldquo;The Mother Goddess of Amanoritsu&rdquo;&hellip; These nicknames are getting worse and worse. Who comes up with this kind of embarrassing stuff?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, little sister, can I ask you something?</p>

<p>&mdash;Yes, brother. What do you want to know?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why are you with Himemiya-san and Shiina-san? You just met her this morning. So how did you get them both here?</p>

<p>No matter how good Matsuri&rsquo;s communication skills are, it&rsquo;s very strange for those two girls to sit and have lunch with us. There must be a hidden reason in all this.</p>

<p>&mdash;The reason is simple, Okugawa-kun. I invited Matsuri-chan to have lunch with us when I asked for her contact information during the break. &mdash; Himemiya-san replied with a serious expression on her face.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kind of surprising that she would have suggested it, and I also had no idea that she went to Matsuri&rsquo;s classroom to ask for her contact details. Is it time to panic already?</p>

<p>&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t ask for them this morning since we were in a hurry, so I took this opportunity to approach her. I don&rsquo;t intend to let a valuable comrade and source of information like her slip away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What does Himemiya-san mean by &lsquo;source of information&rsquo;? Well, I don&rsquo;t plan to ask that question, as it will surely generate another kind of awkward conversation that I don&rsquo;t want to deal with&hellip;</p>

<p>&mdash;I, too, am happy to find a comrade besides Yuu-nii. But I don&rsquo;t think coming to my classroom and asking for my contact details was the smartest thing to do coming from you, Himemiya-senpai. Everything turned into chaos when all my classmates saw you!</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m so sorry, Matsuri-chan. &mdash; Himemiya-san replied, slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine all that Matsuri experienced being approached by Himemiya-san like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can also guess that her classmates bombarded her with many questions about what kind of relationship she has with Himemiya-san. I just hope she didn&rsquo;t say something crazy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, even now, as we speak, I am getting sharp looks from students, even some who seem to be new students. I want to go home, I don&rsquo;t feel safe here.</p>

<p>&mdash;I know we have a lot to talk about, but can we eat now? I&rsquo;m starving.</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking the same thing. Hey, Yuuto, if you want to skip lunch, that&rsquo;s fine, I won&rsquo;t stop you. But I do want to eat something, I&rsquo;m not going to resist all day on an empty stomach.</p>

<p>As soon as Shiina-san and Juri voiced their complaints, I looked at my watch and could tell that we were indeed wasting time. If we didn&rsquo;t hurry up, lunch time would come to an end and I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to enjoy it.</p>

<p>&mdash;Come on, Kanade-chan! I want to eat my beef stew! It&rsquo;s really delicious!</p>

<p>&mdash;Right! Let&rsquo;s hurry before it&rsquo;s gone! Yuuto, I&rsquo;ll go first!</p>

<p>Shiina-san and Juri got up from their seats at high speed over the vending machine like two hungry beasts.</p>

<p>&mdash;What are you planning to eat, Okugawa-kun? The daily choice? Curry? Or maybe pasta? If you want, we can share our lunches.</p>

<p>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t plan to share my food, and don&rsquo;t say such things so lightly. My school life depends more and more on a fine, thin thread.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, you don&rsquo;t have to say boring things like that. Besides, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s more fun to have some stimulation than a quiet life? &mdash; Himemiya-san replied as she brought her face closer to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get so nervous in many ways that I can&rsquo;t even contemplate her, I wish she would stop.</p>

<p>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so. To my misfortune, unlike Himemiya-san, I am an ordinary man who loves peace and quiet.</p>

<p>&mdash;People like you are not encouraged to take risks, you just push them into the lion&rsquo;s cage and wait for them to feel the adrenaline in their bones. But rest assured, I will always be there for you and protect you.</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>At Himemiya-san&rsquo;s words, it was inevitable that my cheeks would not heat up, so I quickly averted my gaze, and as a result, she laughed happily at my reaction.</p>

<p>&mdash;Well, enough chit chat and let&rsquo;s go buy something to eat. At this rate they won&rsquo;t leave us with anything.</p>

<p>Himemiya-san takes my hand and starts running towards the vending machine. And as expected, all the people around us shouted in shock.</p>

<p>Both Shiina-san, Juri and Matsuri shrugged their shoulders with a dismayed expression. I would like to tell them not to look at me like that, but it&rsquo;s impossible, as my heart was racing at Himemiya-san&rsquo;s sudden act.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey&hellip; Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed because we&rsquo;re walking hand in hand, holding hands. You&rsquo;ll only cause me to feel embarrassed too&hellip;</p>

<p>Both Himemiya-san&rsquo;s cheeks and ears turned red as she pursed her lips.</p>

<p>&mdash;If you&rsquo;re embarrassed, then why are you holding my hand&hellip; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if you let go of me so that no one gets the wrong ideas about us? If this goes on like this, the rest of my life will be hell.</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu, don&rsquo;t worry. As I told you before, as long as I&rsquo;m by your side, nothing bad will happen, I&rsquo;ll protect you. &mdash; Himemiya-san replied as she wrapped her hands in mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her charming and dazzling smile made her look like a goddess in a painting.</p>

<p>I was so captivated by her beauty that I had only thoughts about monopolizing that beautiful smile for myself alone. Is this the charm Himemiya-san possesses who attracts men and women alike?</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Okugawa-kun, could you say something instead of keeping quiet? Maybe you didn&rsquo;t want to hold hands with me?</p>

<p>&mdash;No, no! It&rsquo;s not like that! I was just admiring Himemiya-san&rsquo;s cute smile&hellip; Huh, I mean, I just kept thinking about what happened today in class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What the hell just came out of my mouth? I wish I could crawl into a hole and never come out&hellip; If only I had the power to turn back time, I&rsquo;d punch myself in the face a few tens of seconds ago.</p>

<p>I certainly admired her, but I didn&rsquo;t plan on telling her, let alone in front of all the people at school. What kind of crazy thing did I just do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Heh, heh&hellip; So, Okugawa-kun was fascinated by my smile&hellip; &mdash; she replied while looking down with a shining face.</p>

<p>Not to mention that she is now moving her body in a shy manner. A moment ago, you were cool like a prince in a fairy tale. Now you look like a princess in love.</p>

<p>&mdash;Hey, Takanashi-kun, what do you think those two are doing? I think they&rsquo;re replicating a scene from some romantic comedy.</p>

<p>&mdash;What a coincidence, Shiina. I vote for a romantic comedy too. What do you think, Matsuri-chan?</p>

<p>&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking the same thing. Yuu-nii has a habit of speaking his mind. Noel-chan also fell victim to it, but I didn&rsquo;t think Himemiya-senpai would also fall into his trap.</p>

<p>I wish I would complain at the silly comments of those three. But it&rsquo;s impossible to take my eyes off Himemiya-san, who laughs happily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;Fufufu. Thank you for saying such nice things, Okugawa-kun. I feel so happy that I&rsquo;ll buy you lunch.</p>

<p>&mdash;You don&rsquo;t have to buy me anything! Just forget what I just said&hellip;! It was a crazy spur of the moment and&mdash;&hellip;.</p>

<p>Before I could finish my words, Himemiya-san puffed out her cheeks and looked at me seriously in protest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t keep making those cute gestures. My heart won&rsquo;t be able to bear such tenderness.</p>

<p>&mdash;I can&rsquo;t pretend I didn&rsquo;t hear that. In the past you&rsquo;ve said I&rsquo;m beautiful and cool, but this is the first time you&rsquo;ve told me I&rsquo;m cute. So&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think I can forget that easily.</p>

<p>My body shudders as soon as Himemiya-san expresses herself that way with a muffled voice and melancholy. This girl has a high destructive power in terms of having an ability to go from being a cute girl, to moe and pretty in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this rate I will end up completely mesmerized by her charms.</p>

<p>I looked around in a desperate attempt to seek help from Juri, Shiina-san and Matsuri. But to my surprise, they were happily chatting with each other with their food trays in hand, as if they didn&rsquo;t care what happened between me and Himemiya-san&hellip; They are heartless people.</p>

<p>&mdash;Or&hellip; Were you lying when you said I was cute? &mdash; she asked while squeezing her chest tightly and with tears in her eyes. &mdash; I should have guessed that, unlike Fumika, I&rsquo;m not cute at all&hellip;.</p>

<p>Saying that, Himemiya-san sighed heavily as if she was in despair after the end of the world was announced to her. I can&rsquo;t understand how she came to that conclusion.</p>

<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s not true. I think Himemiya-san is&hellip; not only are you beautiful. I think you&rsquo;re cute too.</p>

<p>I scratched my cheek while looking in another direction. I was too embarrassed to have to look directly at her when I say things like that.</p>

<p>Ah, I wish I could go home right now and wrap myself in my futon to escape this cruel reality.</p>

<p>&mdash;Ugh&hellip; Okugawa-kun, you idiot. That was too direct&hellip; Do you really enjoy hurting my heart that much like that? Or are you just a natural lecher?</p>

<p>&mdash;Why do you say I&rsquo;m an idiot? For starters, it was you who started all this, saying you weren&rsquo;t cute at all&hellip; When in reality you&rsquo;re the cutest girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>&hellip;I think I said things without thinking again. I&rsquo;m sure the hostile looks from the guys will be increasing. Goodbye to my peaceful high school life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;&hellip;Do I have to forget those words too?</p>

<p>It would be a pity if this happened. I put my hand on Himemiya-san&rsquo;s head, who was anxiously asking me.</p>

<p>&mdash;You don&rsquo;t have to forget it. Well, if you want to forget it, you can forget it. You are free to do so, but you are not obliged to.</p>

<p>Life really is a box of surprises. I never imagined that one day I would say some clich&eacute; phrase like the dashing protagonists of a romantic comedy do.</p>

<p>&mdash;No, I won&rsquo;t forget what you just said. I won&rsquo;t forget even if you ask me to! &mdash; Himemiya-san affirmed with a big smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That angelic smile&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be able to forget it either.</p>
