<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>(Directional Terms)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Superior or Cranial &#8211; </strong> toward the head end of the body; upper (example, the hand is part of the superior extremity).</p>

<p><strong>Inferior or Caudal &#8211; </strong>away from the head; lower (example, the foot is part of the inferior extremity).</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>(Directional Terms)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lateral Orientation &#8211; </strong>is a position away from the midline of the body. For instance, the arms are lateral to the chest, and the ears are lateral to the head.</p>

<p><strong>Medial Orientation &#8211; </strong>is a position toward the midline of the body. An example of medial orientation is the eyes, which are medial to the ears on the head.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>(Directional Terms)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anterior or Ventral &#8211; </strong>front (example, the kneecap is located on the anterior side of the leg).</p>

<p><strong>Posterior or Dorsal &#8211; </strong>back (example, the shoulder blades are located on the posterior side of the body).</p>

<h3>Exercise Prescription for Beginners</h3>

<p>Prescription is basically based on how <i>intense or intensity,</i> <i>frequency,</i> <i>time,</i> and <i>type</i> of the exercise or FITT Principle.</p>

<p>1. Frequency: three days per week.</p>

<p>2. Intensity: (Moderate) 60 to 90 percent of heart rate reserve.</p>

<p>3. Time: 20 to 30 minutes per session.</p>

<p>4. Type: running or bicycling.</p>

<p>5. Volume: 60 to 90 minutes per week.</p>

<p>6. Progression: gradually increase the intensity or duration of exercise.</p>

<h3>Warm-up and Cool-down</h3>

<p>The purpose of warming up before physical activity is to prepare mentally and physically for your chosen activity. Warming up increases your heart rate and therefore your blood flow which enables more oxygen to reach your muscles. A warm-up also activates and primes the connections between your nerve and muscles, which improves the efficiency of movement. Additionally, your range of motion (flexibility) should be increased by dynamic stretching.</p>

<p>Cooling down after your workout allows for a gradual recovery of preexercise heart rate and blood pressure. Cooling down may be most important for competitive endurance athletes, such as marathoners, because it helps regulate blood flow.</p>

<h3>How do I warm up before exercise?</h3>

<p>A warm-up for light physical activity will take around 10 minutes and involve light aerobic activity and some dynamic stretching movements appropriate for the activity you’re about to perform. This could include:
</p>

<li>fast-paced walking</li>

<li>walking up and down stairs</li>

<li>fast-paced side stepping</li>

<li>jogging on the spot</li>

<li>arm swings</li>

<li>squats</li>

<h3>How do I cool down after exercise?</h3>

<p>Simply reduce the intensity of the activity you have been doing – if you have been jogging, then walk; if you have been running, then jog; fast swimming then easy swim. This will help you gradually reduce your heart rate and begin the process of recovery. Gently stretching each of the main muscle groups for 10–15 seconds will restore their length and can help bring your mind and body back to a resting state.</p>
