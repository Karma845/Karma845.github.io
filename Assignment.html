<h2>Chapter 68: Audience</h2>


Three days had passed since the enthronement ceremony. The capital itself was still under lockdown, but it was impossible to completely stop the flow of people. It was unrealistic to contain the information about the purge of the major nobles and the mass arrests of the aristocracy. The population of the capital was simply too large for that.

Instead of using spies, what I needed now was information. I instructed them to investigate the movements of the lords in the absence of their masters and the movements of Raul Aki-Karl.

By now, the information about the enthronement ceremony should have reached the Raul Duchy and the Aki-Karl Duchy. It is expected that they will rise up in rebellion immediately.

Furthermore, on the day after the enthronement ceremony, Count Chamno requested to disclose information about the purge. As I mentioned before, it was not something that could be concealed, and if they could make good use of it, I gave permission to disclose it.

Count Chamno, who received permission, seems to have informed the commanders of the Prime Minister faction and the Regent faction who were leading their troops during the ceremony. In addition, Count Chamno added false information that many nobles had fled and that the army was suspected as their escape destination, and that they might be attacked by the private army of the Emperor and the army that surrendered under Duke Waren.

Many of the commanders of the feudal troops in Count Chamno's forces are vassals... They are close to the lowest ranks among the aristocracy. Unable to comprehend the situation, they decided to return to their own territories for the time being. It is only natural for them not to be able to stay near the capital, which is like being in enemy territory.

In this way, Count Chamno effectively neutralized the feudal armies. Rather than disarming them, it was more appreciated from my side to have them flee. It is troublesome to have people who could potentially become "enemy soldiers" near the capital for too long, and if an attempt to disarm them is resisted, it would result in the depletion of valuable military strength.

Although they are unreliable mercenaries, they are currently valuable forces.

Above all, the last thing I want is to have to recapture the captured nobles. It would be better for them to return to their own territories than to go on a rampage. As long as we have captured the heads of the nobles, it is as good as sealing off their subordinate forces.

Then, Duke Waren, who received my letter, doesn't seem to intend to be hostile to us. He has already returned to the Empire and sent a letter of loyalty to the Emperor. So today, Duke Waren is coming to the court. Count Chamno and Fabio will also attend the audience.

I actually wanted him to come yesterday, but it was simply impossible. After all, Duke Waren's forces were facing off against Count Chamno's forces. They were enemies until yesterday. Even if Duke Waren himself agreed to pass through in front of them and head to the capital, his retainers would not consent.

So first, I had both armies move. Count Chamno's army... which is now mostly composed of mercenaries, was moved to the south of the capital, and Duke Waren and Fabio's army was moved to the west of the capital.

This is because the defense on the south and west sides of the capital is strong due to its structure. It's only natural not to let them go to the east side, where there are no city walls, even after a few days of ceasefire (there hasn't been any fighting in the first place).

Duke Waren, accompanied by his escort, passed through the gates of the capital. The citizens apparently welcomed
