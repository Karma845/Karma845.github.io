<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Yayoi Shirou. Thank you for picking up this novel.</p>

<p>So, Boy Meets Girl, abbreviated as BMG! It's been about five years since I wrote a pure BMG. This genre is my favorite, and my debut work was in the same vein, so it feels quite nostalgic.</p>

<p>Throughout my novel history, I think boys have met various girls, which woven's my works</p>

<p>Whether it's a foreign princess, a fantasy different race, or even an android. Because she's so different from oneself, there's a desire to know more. I believe when different perspectives meet there are more stories born.</p>

<p>For me, the girl who is very different from myself shouldn't be a princess, or from different race, nor an android; she must be a devilishly charming girl who's used at guys, just like Mimori-san.</p>

<p>No, I'm serious.</p>

<p>Back in high school, I didn't have a girlfriend, and I didn't even have any female friends to talk to properly. From my perspective as someone who spent most of his time in the library, the cool girls in class were completely incomprehensible. The fictional girls from novels felt much closer to me.</p>

<p>That's how strange it is for a girl to know a man.</p>

<p>That's why I wanted to make such a girl as the heroine.</p>

<p>A boy who had never really talked to girls before and a girl with a bad reputation that anyone would avoid if they were a guy. I wrote a story about these high school students meeting.</p>

<p>In the end, Riku and Mimori got along well, but I think they'll continue to be different from each other while still wanting to be closer.</p>

<p>If their BMG touched someone's heart, I would be greatly honored.</p>

<p>It's a bit late, but I want to express my gratitude. To the editor-in-chief who stayed with me until the end, to the illustrator who gave life to the characters, to the designer who handled the cover design, to the proofreader who provided sharp feedback, and to the printing company and all the bookstores nationwide.</p>

<p>And above all, to you who read this novel. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Well, that's it for now. Until we meet again, take care.</p>
