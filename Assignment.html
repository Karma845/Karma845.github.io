<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It has been a while. My name is Hama Kazushi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">First of all, thank you for picking up this book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s been a year since my last book, “My Tutor Is Too Aggressive, I Can’t Study!’ This is the first new work in a year since the last one. It seems like it was long, short, or just right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I came up with the idea for this piece last summer. A street piano was to be installed in my neighborhood, and I thought it would be cool to play the piano there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This small idea grew and took the form of weaving this story in a retroactive manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi refuses to communicate with Satsuki because of her secret. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki struggles to communicate with Yayoi because he knows her secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Communication is not only about words. There should be many ways to convey your feelings. I hope that Satsuki and Yayoi’s feelings and actions to communicate with something other than words will reach your hearts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now, I would like to thank the many people who helped me this time as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mr. Koyama, the person in charge. Thank you again for all your advice from the planning stage. The decision to separate the Satsuki part and the Yayoi part was also something I came up with based on Mr. Koyama’s advice. We are delighted if the work has turned out as we originally intended.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Thank you to Mr. Pulp Piloshi for the illustrations. I was trembling when I saw the character design, which fits the image perfectly in every way. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">To the editorial department of Gaga Bunko and everyone else involved in this book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And to the readers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can only express my gratitude. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have written an unprecedentedly serious afterword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The epilogue of the book ends in a significant way, but God only knows if a second volume will be published. I hope to be able to write the continuation of this story, but we will see what happens.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Your support will be a great help to me, and I would be very happy if you could give me some feedback. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wish you all good health and hope to be able to publish the second volume. See you soon!</span></p>
