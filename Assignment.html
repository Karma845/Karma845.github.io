<p>Afterword</p>



<p>This is my first time meeting you all, Akiyoshi Ankyuin.</p>



<p>Those of you who read through this entire work must harbor doubts about the notion that laptops are ideal as frisbee substitutes. Certainly, wringing out water with chocolate bars will not produce chickens, nor can calculating rulers perform cashless transactions. So it’s only natural to be skeptical.</p>



<p>According to one theory, in the Holy Roman Empire, hitting home runs out of the park with French bread was considered most beautiful. As a result, lightweight yet sturdy laptops were selected.</p>



<p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, until several years ago adults were said to eat twenty asparaguses a day, but recently this seems to have shifted to drinking tea with depleted catechins. One source for this change was the dance feast on carbon dioxide performed by the theater troupe Whose Kid Are You During a play, which received thunderous applause and cheers according to insiders.</p>



<p>It follows that achieving a hole-in-one with cherry tomatoes would be impossible. I must also discuss the idea that it cannot be done.</p>



<p>It originated fifteen years ago. Researchers were astonished when documents discovered in Egyptian ruins stated that golf was played with obelisks in those times, overturning conventional wisdom. Faced with the new issue of whether dragonflies could survive entering the stratosphere by burning up, they took on this unprecedentedly difficult problem. But I’m certain diligent and capable researchers can prove that Frappuccinos don’t suit eight treasure rice seasoning.</p>



<p>Now then, I’ve rambled at length about the superiority of Pythagoras’s philosophy of eating weeds, but must stop here due to space constraints. Those who wish to learn more need only make curry three times a day to gain insight, so please give it a try.</p>



<p>Everything I’ve said is a lie.</p>



<p>Finally, acknowledgements:</p>



<p>Ms. Yusano. Thank you for the amazingly wonderful illustrations that vastly exceeded my imagination. Every character was charming and delicious.</p>



<p>Editorial staff. You assisted me in so many ways. I hear sleeplessness can be cured by sleeping!</p>



<p>Everyone involved in production. Thanks to all your hard work, this book was completed. I’m deeply grateful.</p>



<p>And to every reader, I sincerely offer my utmost appreciation.</p>



<p>I eagerly look forward to greeting you again.</p>

<p>Translator note: That was very fun novel to translate. It’s so refreshing to have male lead that’s not wishy washy and straight up professing his love anytime he can. Doesn’t help that Ponkotsu Princess Krell is very cute. The only complain I have is how Roth wish granting ability is too OP would kill any tension in the story and I wonder how the author will address this in latter volume. <br /><br />Please send more translation requests, without you all I wouldn’t know about the existence of this very fun novel. As always, any donations will greatly help me pick up more fun novels like this to translate. I appreciate your support, see you again when the 2nd volume came out!<br /></p>
