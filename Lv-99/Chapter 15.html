<h3>Chapter 15: The Prince&#8217;s Apology</h3>

<p>There’s a girl in a rural elementary school who doesn’t have someone else in the same grade as her. The closest thing is a boy two years older than her. He didn’t hate her and listened to her stories, and he also teaches her how to study.</p>



<p>He will be her first love.</p>



<p>「My situation is the same as that girl, I guess. 」</p>



<p>「What? Who’s the girl? 」</p>



<p>「Since I didn’t have to interact with many people, I think I am mistaken between affection and love. 」</p>



<p>「So, what are you talking about? 」</p>







<p>I let Linus, the neighbouring kingdom’s spy escaped, and I also used the same route to escape.</p>



<p>When I returned to the academy, I thought with a cool head, and I concluded that I misunderstood my feelings for Patrick.</p>



<p>Right now, I’m speaking to him. I’m so embarrassed I didn’t say the last part. Naturally, it didn’t make sense, and he couldn’t understand it, so he asked me what I’m talking about.</p>







<p>「Etto, I told you I wanted to be friends with Patrick. 」</p>



<p>I muster up my courage to say that, and he replied with a tone of disappointment.</p>



<p>「Did you never thought that we’re already friends? 」</p>



<p>「Eh? 」</p>



<p>「We are friends already. 」</p>



<p>Combined with his appearance, his answer made him look even cooler.</p>



<p>No, such a person didn’t exist. There must have been something behind it, I won’t get tricked.</p>



<p>「I’m not going to attack Remrest, but I’ll defend from it if it’s necessary. 」</p>



<p>His hometown lies along the border. I’m sure the Count Ashbaton territory’s utility is immeasurable.&nbsp;</p>







<p>「Considering your distrust about other people&#8230; Will it become a bad influence?</p>



<p>I’m ashamed to have to repeat this, I won’t take advantage of Yumiela’s strength. In the first place, I don’t want to do that myself, and I know if that’s happening, you will run away. 」</p>



<p>Patrick says as he stares fixedly into my eyes. Even when his face began to turn red a little, he keeps looking at me.</p>



<p>「Even if you became Level 1, I’ll still stay by your side. 」</p>



<p>「It’s okay. I can raise my level from the start again. 」</p>



<p>「That’s not&#8230; haa. 」</p>



<p>Patrick sighed heavily.</p>



<p>Is it embarrassing to raise your level again? Well, I can understand if he feels embarrassed.</p>







<p>「Right, I want to tell you something. Someone wants to meet and talk to you. 」</p>



<p>How unusual, it’s not every day Patrick tried to introduce me to someone. Do they know me?</p>



<p>Right now I’m in a good mood, so I’ll meet with anyone and let’s have a conversation.</p>



<p>「Sure, who would you like me meet? 」</p>



<p>When I asked who I should meet, Patrick seems to have a hard time answering me.</p>



<p>「I know you don’t want to see him and didn’t trust him, but he’s reflecting on it&#8230; 」</p>



<p>Who? Tell me quickly.</p>



<p>「&#8230;His Highness Edwin. 」</p>



<p>When I heard the prince’s name, it suddenly gave me a terrible feeling.</p>




<p>In the school parlour, this is the room that used when the principal summoned me. And now we sat face to face in silence.</p>



<p>The prince doesn’t seem to like to start talking. He supposed to speak when he’s the one who wanted to meet me, especially when he asked Patrick for help.</p>



<p>「So, what’s the story? 」</p>



<p>It was unusual for him not to bite when I asked, when he’s ready to answer, he opened his mouth in a determined manner.</p>



<p>「&#8230;I’m sorry. 」</p>



<p>「Eh? 」</p>



<p>「I’m sorry for my disrespectful behaviour to Miss Yumiela. My assumption was wrong, and my stubbornness also didn’t help at all. 」</p>



<p>My thoughts stopped when I heard his words. He keeps saying his piece even with my confusion.</p>



<p>「From the start father already explained to me that there’s no way you can be the Demon King. I dare say myself understand what it means.</p>



<p>But I couldn’t bring myself to admit what I said was wrong. And all those conversations around me, I only heard things that were convenient for me.</p>



<p>Due to my immaturity, I must have caused trouble for Miss Yumiela. It would have been unpleasant. I’m terribly sorry about that. 」</p>







<p>There’s no anger when I heard Prince Edwin’s apology, it was just a feeling of resignation that I wasn’t a child.</p>



<p>He wasn’t the only child; every student in the academy are basically children. They’re swallowing all those groundless rumours, rejecting those who stand out being conspicuous and the minorities.</p>



<p>Because the class leader dislikes me, everyone just ignores my existence. What I experienced here could also happen in Japanese senior high school.</p>







<p>「Why the sudden apology? 」</p>



<p>I questioned what the reason for the sudden change of mind was.</p>



<p>「I listened to Patrick. 」</p>



<p>Patrick? Why did you mention his name here? Speaking of which, he was also the one who told me the prince want to meet.</p>



<p>Prince Edwin continues to answer my question.</p>



<p>「Patrick told me what Miss Yumiela said. That&#8217;s your strength is based on efforts that are incomparable to us. I&#8217;ve been hearing everyday stories about you, and I finally understand that you were an ordinary person.</p>



<p>I was blind to believe that I was making the most effort, but deep down in my heart, I was scared that you weren’t normal.</p>



<p>I know it sounds like a poor excuse. And how selfish is this, but can you forgive me? 」</p>







<p>「I understand his Highness situation. I was also aware that I lack common sense myself. Please treat me well. 」</p>



<p>I don’t know whether to forgive Prince Edwin or not, and it’s not that I don’t want to get along with him, nor do I want to retaliate. I don’t think this will change my behaviour in particular.</p>



<p>「I’d like to do something to make up for my mistakes, is there anything that I can do for you? I&#8217;ll try my best to make it happen. 」</p>



<p>「Then, will you allow me to accompany to the subjugation of the Demon King? 」</p>



<p>Every time he did something, my peace became distant, so I don’t need anything else. If possible, I don’t want you to get involved as much as possible.</p>



<p>「Ah, just like what Patrick said. 」</p>



<p>Prince Edwin looks satisfied. What did Patrick tell him?</p>







<p>「Your Highness, may I ask a question? What did Patrick have to say about me? 」</p>



<p>I hope I can ask this much. I’m worried to hear it.</p>



<p>「He said that Miss Yumiela has no interest in power and fortune, basically a good-natured person with a strong personality and even though you have a bad reputation you didn’t give up. 」</p>



<p>It was way more than I expected. There&#8217;s just one thing that worries me.</p>



<p>「Basically&#8230; What do you mean? 」</p>



<p>「Patrick said that&#8230; Sometimes your mind and behaviour are strange but you are a good person. 」</p>



<p>&#8230;I knew it, I shouldn’t have said anything. The prince, who felt my gaze, explains.</p>



<p>「I’m answering your question sincerely&#8230; 」</p>



<p>You can’t help but be serious in a strange place. Somehow, I found out what Patrick thought about me&#8230;</p>







<p>When Prince Edwin finished with our discussion, he left the room, passing Principal Ronald who came in.</p>



<p>「How was your talk with His Highness? 」</p>



<p>「I thought he was a different person. It’s not his body double, right? 」</p>



<p>When I gave him my honest impression, he gave me a wry smile and said.</p>



<p>「It’s been a strange year, from the start Prince Edwin was a well-informed and flexible child. I’m relieved that he finally opened his eyes. 」</p>



<p>「Well, I can cooperate and help to raise his level, will he managed to take care the Demon King? 」</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel grateful to Patrick for his intervention, and I might be able to spend a decent school life.</p>



<p>「However, the other three are still being their usual self. 」</p>



<p>The other three that being mentioned here would be Alicia and the two capture targets.</p>



<p>「It would be good if his Highness could convince them&#8230; 」</p>



<p>「I did that, but it’s not working. Alicia-san is stubborn, and the others are blind to her. So, I decided to intervene by forcing Alicia-san, even if she didn’t want to level up.</p>



<p>But, I’d like to ask is this okay? As long as she didn’t die, it’s fine, right? 」</p>







<p>That stupid prince, since you apologize, I wanted you to persuade the others. Looking back a little, I feel the same way.</p>



<p>I don’t mind with Alicia’s power levelling since I’m the one who suggested it to the principal earlier.</p>






<p>Alicia may be a little bit more reasonable if she learns the fun and joy of leveling up.</p>
