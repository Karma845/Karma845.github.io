<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 15 - Like</h1>


<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Saturday night when I came back from a date with Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remembered that I had kept a toy piano in the closet, and so I pulled it out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A tiny piano for children to use.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at the box again and saw that it was for ages three and up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so impressed by Satsuki-kun’s performance at the school festival last year that I wanted to try playing the piano myself, so I bought it secretly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to connect with Satsuki-kun, who was out of my reach at that time, in some sort of way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This cute little red piano was a small piece of my wish.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought if I could play the piano, I could express my feelings clearly, but it wasn’t that easy and I gave up right when I began.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had a job as an agent, and I didn’t need to play the piano nor express my true feelings to anyone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I wasn’t lying about my desire to play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After half a year, it was Satsuki-kun who revived that feeling in me once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pressed the keyboard for the first time in a long while.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Tink, tink, tink </span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The light sound, which wasn’t even a melody, echoed in the room for a short while before it quickly disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun was playing melodies much more skillfully and tenderly. He was expressing himself with the sound. That sound was filled with emotions that could not be expressed verbally.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I closed my eyes, I saw Satsuki-kun in a beautiful forest, on the surface of a clear lake, with a white cloud in a bright blue sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to exist in that world with him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The scenery that the piano had showed me, it was hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I found hope in Satsuki-kun, who was doing what he truly wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This sound that keeps ringing in my heart was played by Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Not yet, please, I wish I could hear it again…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But that wish didn’t come true. Satsuki-kun couldn’t play the piano anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time I have to be the one to do it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What can I do for Satsuki-kun?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I change, Satsuki-kun will most likely have the courage to play the piano again. I thought I could push him to play the piano again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So I practiced the piano diligently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But as a complete beginner, I couldn’t play it at all. I couldn’t read music, I had no sense of pitch, and my right and left hands moved very awkwardly on the toy piano. I couldn’t even seem to play simple pieces on it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My father and mother were away for a while doing some agent work. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This was a common occurrence in the Kinoshita household, and it was not unusual for me and Uzuki to be left alone to look after the house from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Taking advantage of this, I decided to skip school for once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For now, I just wanted to learn to play one song and have Satsuki-kun listen to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It had been the third day since I took a day off from school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I could play it slowly, but I managed to properly finish it. It was a piece called “Canon,” which was a piece that even a beginner should be able to play. I had heard this song somewhere before, so it was easy to remember when trying it out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then, Uzuki brought Satsuki-kun home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He seemed to be worried about me because I had been absent from school for three days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I had not yet improved enough to let Satsuki-kun hear me play, and I wanted to keep it a secret that I had started playing the piano for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I lied to Satsuki-kun that I wasn’t feeling well to cover it up and get him to leave for the day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course I couldn’t say anything about my agent work and I couldn’t dig up the fact that Satsuki-kun couldn’t play the piano anymore. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew it was hard to not say anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then Satsuki-kun told me about himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He told me what really happened at the festival and why he could no longer play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had never thought that his performance at that time was such a failure that it would drag on for that long. It was just that I was naive. For Satsuki-kun himself, it was a big shock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘I want you to do what you want to do, Kinoshita-san.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun told me that so many times.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He exposed his past and trauma and pushed me as if he knew about my problems.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So I confided in him. About how I was practicing the piano. I wanted Satsuki-kun to listen to me wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to push Satsuki-kun too, you know?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now that I think about it, we’re essentially doing the same thing. I was thinking about Satsuki-kun, and Satsuki-kun was acting with me in mind. We’re kind of similar, aren’t we?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So far, I never fully pushed my boundaries. I always prepared an excuse first and protected myself from a safe distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Once I had something, I was afraid of losing it. So I never wanted anything specific from the beginning. I gave up with the excuse that’s, ‘I’m an agent, it’s what I have to do.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But when I heard Satsuki-kun play the piano, I felt hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun taught me that just because I am an agent, it doesn’t mean that I can’t do what I want to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Is that what you really want? Not doing something you really want to do?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun kept asking me that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was just running away from my feelings. That wasn’t a sense of responsibility now, was it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t know why he cared about me so much at first, but I didn’t dislike it. I was rather happy, and I was no longer afraid to open up to him, little by little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A flower blooms because someone gives it water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I see the moon because the sun illuminates it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can be honest just because you were there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No more excuses. I won’t make excuses for my feelings now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to be your hope this time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was very nervous to play the piano in front of Satsuki-kun. As I expected, I forgot the sheet music and made a major mistake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I hope Satsuki-kun felt it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hope Satsuki-kun can play the piano again, though it’s different from my failure as a beginner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There is only so much that I can do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">B-But you know what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I realized for the first time how good it feels to be able to do what I </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">really </span></i><span class="calibre8">want to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When Satsuki-kun left, I opened the curtains that I always leave closed the entire day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was dark outside, but the moonlight shone into the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had always tried to stay in the darkness myself, but now there was light in front of me. I can walk toward the light that is hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Satsuki-kun who showed me that light of hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Everything changed when I met Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The sound of my heart has been ringing ever since I met Satsuki-kun six months ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I became honest, I finally understood what this sound was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is what you call heart pounding, isn’t it? My heart has been pounding this entire time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I see. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I like you, Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to do something for you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to see you smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s what ‘liking’ someone means, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hope I can convey this feeling to you properly someday. ……</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, the mirror on my desk caught my eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the reflection was a high school girl with a red face and a bright smile on her face. </span></p>
