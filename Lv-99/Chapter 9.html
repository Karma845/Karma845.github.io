<h1 class="calibre3">9Chapter 9 - The Most Important Thing</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I got back home from school and began changing my clothes to prepare to go jogging, I heard some voices outside my house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I opened the door to see if Uzuki had come back, and for some reason I saw Satsuki-kun was standing there too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said that she had met him by coincidence after school, but that couldn’t be true. It must have been all planned by Uzuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember the last time we argued and she yelled something like, “I’ll support you on my own.”  Was that what it was all about?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, Uzuki, explain what happened to me, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When Satsuki-kun left, Uzuki had also changed out of her school uniform and was just lying on the sofa watching the TV.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was wearing an oversized light blue parka and shorts. The hood of the parka has cat ears on it, and the fact that she can wear this kind of clothes without any </span><span class="calibre8">embarrassment is what makes her different from me. I can’t believe we are sisters, she has such different taste and guts compared to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was shocked that Satsuki-kun had seen me in a jersey, and I’m still dragging my gloomy feelings within me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I picked up Japii, who was spinning around in the living room, and stood between Uzuki and the TV.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Argh, sis, you’re in the way!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do I mean…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I asked slowly and calmly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are you talking about, sis?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-…It’s about Fukase-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even though Uzuki knows what I’m talking about, I can’t help but speak louder when it comes to saying his name</span><span class="calibre8">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“When I was changing my shoes at the shoe closet, I saw Satsuki-senpai come in at the same time. He said he was free, so I asked him if he wanted to go home with me. It was a </span><span class="calibre8">natural thing to do, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki flaps her legs as if she wasn’t offended at all, and I try to stay calm, but I’m actually filled with anger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun’s house is in the opposite direction of ours, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh, sis, you know Satsuki-senpai’s house? That’s great!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-I don’t know! I’m asking you, why are you bringing him to our house!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I interrogated Satsuki-kun the other day, I heard that he commutes to school by a monorail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I mean, sis, you seem pretty angry since quite a while ago. I’m sorry for what I did with Satsuki-senpai. Do you hate me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m just mad at you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If Uzuki had forced him to come with her, it was out of line for me to lash out at Satsuki-kun. But I wasn’t prepared for it and so I couldn’t welcome it either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was really embarrassing to be seen in such a lame jersey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Why don’t </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">you</span></i><span class="calibre8"> ask him to come over next time, sis?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I won’t!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was nothing more I could say to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know that Uzuki is always thinking about me. I know she doesn’t mean to offend me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She also knows that I’m always alone at school. Not only that, but she also knows that I may be interested in Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure Uzuki is thinking of me in her own way, but I don’t appreciate it at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai, he’s a nice guy. He’s too good for my sister, isn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…You’ve been doing a lot of things to provoke me lately, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m doing this for you, sis. I told you, I’d support you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s in it for me? You’re just embarrassing me by inviting my classmates to my house without my permission.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re all alone at school, right, sis? You have to take care of those who befriend you too. Satsuki-senpai said that he doesn’t have a girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Y-y, you two talked about that stuff?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reflexive stiffening of my body caused Japii, who I was holding, to startle and run away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wanted to ask him some more questions, but he left because of you. Isn’t that right, Japii?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She stroked Japii’s tail as he ran away to Uzuki, and repeatedly provoked me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know why Uzuki is so excessive when it comes to me and Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You should be more honest with him. It’s obvious how you feel about him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“W-What do you mean, how I feel about him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Your face is always red in front of Satsuki-senpai, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><span class="calibre8">I-It’s not, not at all! Are you stupid or something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I quickly cover my cheeks with my hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s a lie, of course it’s not true. See, my cheeks are so cold right now!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Think about Satsuki-senpai. Wasn’t he cool when he caught Japii just now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki was grinning, placing her hands on her cheeks as if she was imitating my actions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know I shouldn’t be provoked by her, but the image of Satsuki-kun from earlier comes to mind with a flutter of excitement. When he picked up Japii, our hands touched each other for a little bit…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…See, you’re turning bright red! Sis, your body is so honest!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I did feel my cheeks getting a little hotter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, no! It’s not!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Eh, wait a minute? Are you saying that my face has been red in front of Satsuki-kun this entire time? That’s a lie, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Does that mean you’re aware of how I look, Satsuki-kun?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, no, no, no, no, no!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t tease me! You’re in high school now, you should be more mature.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I turn around and throw out a discarded line, unable to face her properly anymore after receiving a startling revelation from Uzuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My cheeks are still piping hot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hmph~ I’m angry at you, sis.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki, who had been playing and focusing all her attention on Japii, teased me half-heartedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘”Enough! I’m going back to my room. “</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I leave the living room so that Uzuki can’t see my face any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Even my sister can be a normal high school girl sometimes!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard Uzuki’s voice say something about me as I walked out into the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I returned to my room and stood in front of the mirror at once, my face really was red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really? No way…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had been trying to be as normal as possible so that Satsuki-kun wouldn’t know how I felt. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As an agent, having a poker face is a fundamental part of the job. It’s not that I </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">can’t </span></i><span class="calibre8">be honest, it’s just that I shouldn’t be honest with myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not that I can’t be straightforward either, it’s that I’ve been too frank in ways I didn’t know were possible, which is stupid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I collapse on the bed and don’t move an inch. I shouldn’t have been embarrassed to be seen in my jersey. I was unknowingly doing something even more embarrassing!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What kind of face am I supposed to make when I go to school tomorrow?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Hah~…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I sighed out naturally which made me feel a little depressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to talk to him normally in the classroom and go home with him too, I don’t want to just fantasize about it by myself all the time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just like Uzuki, I want to be called Yayoi-chan too. I want to hear Satsuki-kun play the piano again as well…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There are so many things I want to do with him. So many things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I can’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Because as the eldest daughter of the Kinoshita family, I have to take over as an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I had put everything inside my heart and locked it away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But now my heart’s so shaken that I can’t help it.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My job as an agent was when I was five years old.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The job itself was very simple. All I had to do was attach a transmitter to a target, and because I was a child, I could do it without arousing any suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even then, I had a vague understanding of how an agent’s job works. I also had a bare-bones sense that I was not allowed to tell other friends about my father’s occupation at</span> <span class="calibre8">all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mother explained to me that it was a job to protect important things, and I believed her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Protecting important things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was enough magic for a young girl like me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I successfully completed my first task, my mother and father were very happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well done! Let’s buy Yayoi’s favorite cake on the way back home!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mother was praising me and Uzuki was clapping her hands in excitement, although she was clueless about what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The Kinoshita family will be safe now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Seeing the look of satisfaction on my father’s face was enough to make me happy too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I helped my father with his work even more, he would praise me more. My mother would be happy too. It would also help my little sister. If I did that, the Kinoshita family </span><span class="calibre8">would always be safe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That is why I worked so hard. I wanted to be praised, for the sake of my family.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That year, on Tanabata (the Star Festival). (TLN: <a href="https://www.globetrottinkids.com/discover-tanabata-the-japanese-star-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre3">How is Tanabata Celebrated? People celebrate by <b class="calibre13">writing wishes on small pieces of paper (called tanzaku) and hanging them on bamboo branches with hopes they will come true</b>. Other decorations including origami designs and colorful streamers may also be part of the display</a>.)</span> <span class="calibre8">It was our family tradition to hang strips of paper with wishes written on them on the bamboo branch decorated in the living room. The previous year, I think it was ‘I want a </span><span class="calibre8">stuffed bear.’ I remember Uzuki imitating me and writing ‘I want a bear.’</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This year, my wish was….</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘I want to be an agent like my father.’</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Seeing this strip of paper, my father, who usually does not smile at all, smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi is so kind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My father said and patted my head. I innocently responded with a smile, and now I had a reason to work hard again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That wish was not a lie. It was not out of consideration for my father, but my honest and true feelings at that time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When my sisters and I became elementary school students, we no longer decorated the bamboo branches with our wishes, and that was the last time I had made a wish. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Gradually, I stopped smiling as time went on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If the bamboo branches were still displayed on Tanabata, what would I wish for right now?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Would I be able to write my true wish on a strip of paper like I did back then?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, I’m sure I cannot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The words ‘Work to protect what’s important to you,’ as they were explained to me back then no longer fill me with a sense of joy, now it pierces a hole in my heart with how empty it feels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Important things? Who is it important for? For whom are we protecting those ‘things’?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve not been able to answer that question that’s been recurring in my mind for quite a while now. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I go about my work, a sense of discomfort gradually builds up inside my heart. I search for someone else’s secret and uncover the truth about them. Secretly, without being found out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As a result, I’m destroying someone’s life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not protecting something important. I’m just taking it away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, there are jobs to help people as well, to thwart wrongdoings in the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I don’t have the right to choose my work. Not everything in the world is so pretty. This is especially true for dark work such as being an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Do I have to separate myself from what I want just because it’s my job? Am I lost because I can’t grow up normally? Is it okay for someone else to be unhappy as long as someone else is satisfied?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want a job where I have to dig into other people’s secrets.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><b class="calibre13">I don’t want to be an agent.</b></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure Uzuki is already aware of that. That’s why she says things like that from time to time. She knows why I don’t make any friends, and she knows that I’ve been holding </span><span class="calibre8">myself back for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki is a girl who can act honestly on her thoughts. She’s the type of girl who can go after what she wants to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But, I can’t be like Uzuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t be honest with myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to see my mother and father sad, and I can’t force myself like Uzuki to do what I want.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know I have to do it. On top of that, I’m worried about myself too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As a sophomore, I can finally feel the lid of my locked-up heart moving. Various things I have been holding back and giving up are about to overflow out of my heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t like to be alone all the time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When someone says good morning to me, I want to smile and say good morning back to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to keep away from the things I like.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to be closer to Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What should I do…? </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki is right. I know it myself, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve always been a wimp and a coward. I always pretend not to see or hear my true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No matter what I write on the tanzaku, no matter what the Milky Way says, my wish will never come true.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><b class="calibre13">I want to be a normal high school girl. </b></p>
