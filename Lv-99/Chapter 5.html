<h1>Chapter 05: Tea party with the Queen</h1>

<p>I was taken to the room where the Queen is in the inner part of
the palace, where the private space of the royal family located.</p>



<p>The Queen and a maid were waiting in a room with a cozy and
relaxed atmosphere arranged for the tea party。</p>



<p>「Yumiela-san,
thank you for coming.</p>



<p>I was hoping for his Majesty to join us, alas, he was busy with
work. 」</p>



<p>The Queen had this youthful and calm air around her.</p>






<p>「My
name is Yumiela Dolknes. I feel honored for the invitation. 」</p>



<p>「This
is an informal occasion, so you don’t have to be so formal about it.」</p>



<p>Said the Queen as she smiled softly and wink at the maid. The
maid was leaving the room after she finished brewing black tea for me.</p>



<p>「The
conversation in this room wouldn’t leave the room. I won’t share it with
anyone. 」</p>



<p>What? I can smell the trouble already. Please, I want to go
home.</p>







<p>「Fufu,
you know you don’t need to worry, right? His Majesty and I, both of us like
you?</p>



<p>Your response to the audience was praiseworthy. I was relieved
that someone with a good head on your shoulder like you got strong power. 」</p>



<p>「Th-thank
you for the compliment? 」</p>



<p>I’m surprised at the unexpected high opinion. </p>



<p>「Yumiela-san
think it’s troublesome to have power, right? And you seem like a sharp young
lady.</p>



<p>I’m afraid to imagine that you are an ambitious person with an empty
head. 」</p>



<p>「Ano,
why her Majesty trust me so much? 」</p>



<p>「There
are many nobles who approach the royal family by pretending they have no
desire. </p>



<p>You don’t think you’re not involved with the royal family, do
you? I’m afraid I can’t trust that kind of person. 」</p>







<p>She was silent. She couldn’t tell her that she doesn’t want to
be involved with the royal family in front of her, right? And the Queen continued.</p>



<p>「Let’s
get down to business.</p>



<p>This information is only known to the royal family and some of
the nobles, but the demon king will come back in 2 years. 」</p>



<p>What the Queen said surprised me.</p>



<p>It’s not about the demon king&#8217;s resurrection that surprises me,
but how accurate that prediction is.</p>



<p>In the game, when the heroine became a third-year student, the
demon king was resurrected without notice.</p>



<p>The royal family may have information about the demon king that wasn’t
revealed in the game.</p>







<p>「The
demon king&#8230;? 」</p>



<p>「Yes,
I want your cooperation in defeating the demon king.</p>



<p>When the army in charge of suppressing the demon king’s monster
army, we need a small team to defeat the demon king. 」</p>



<p>「I
understand. Since the kingdom was in danger, I’ll cooperate. 」</p>



<p>I replied immediately, also in case of emergency, I was planning
to defeat the demon king myself.</p>



<p>「Thank you, Yumiela-san.</p>



<p>I feel bad for asking you to risk your own life like this&#8230; </p>



<p>And it’s bad for the kingdom if you are the one who defeats the
demon king. 」</p>







<p>It’s bad for the kingdom if I defeat the demon king? I tried to
think about what she means by that, and I remember something.</p>



<p>「Is
it about the king’s legitimacy? 」</p>



<p>The Kingdom of Balshine, created by the hero and saintess who
sealed the demon king, it said that the royal family is their descendants.</p>



<p>That’s the reason why the king ruled this kingdom.</p>



<p>But if someone not related to the royal family defeats the demon
king, that theory will fall apart. </p>



<p>「Yumiela-san
catch on quickly, it’s like that.</p>



<p>The hero’s descendant is only a formal reason; the king’s cause
is important. 」</p>



<p>The Queen says, astonished. </p>



<p>I noticed the prince had been involved in the demon king’s in
the game, how sneaky of them.</p>







<p>「Edwin
will be on his way to subdue the demon king.</p>



<p>I would be happy if Yumiela-san could join as a saintess&#8230;&#8230;」</p>



<p>But if they announce me as the saintess, that’s mean I will marry
Prince Edwin. And I don’t want that to happen because it sucks.</p>



<p>「Alicia,
who uses light magic, is more suitable for the saintess position.</p>



<p>And she seemed to get along well with his Highness Edwin at the
school. 」</p>



<p>Let’s sacrifice the heroine.</p>



<p>「Are
you refusing it? If you didn’t like it, you could frankly say it.</p>



<p>Ah, if you don’t like Edwin, how about marrying Morris? 」</p>



<p>「I’m
not trying to be ungrateful, but I will refuse. 」</p>



<p>When the first prince was recommended, I immediately refused. Well,
the Queen was the one who said that I must be frank if I don’t like it.</p>



<p>「Fufufu,
I won’t force you if you don’t like it. I don’t want you to run away to the
rival’s country.</p>



<p>All things considered, I will tell both of my sons. 」</p>



<p>Perhaps because I refused the marriage proposal with the princes
so firmly, the Queen burst into laughter.</p>







<p>After her laughter subsides, she changed the subject, and her
expression turns serious.</p>



<p>「We
will discuss the demon king in detail later.</p>



<p>Right now, the problem is the nobles who want to bring
Yumiela-san into their faction. </p>



<p>Since the information about your level has been circulated, tomorrow,
they will begin to try to win you over. 」</p>



<p>「It’s
not a problem to join the King or the Queen’s faction, isn’t it?」</p>



<p>「My
and His Majesty factions are the main, but faction is not monolithic. The
struggle for Yumiela-san will start inside the main faction.</p>



<p>While the main faction is moderate, there are a few problems. Yumiela-san
seems to be able to get around very well. 」</p>







<p>The Queen continued to lecture me on the noble’s faction.</p>



<p>「You
should be careful with the radical faction led by Duke Hillrose.</p>



<p>Stay away from aggressive war proposals against other countries.</p>



<p>And please watch out for contact with intelligence agents from
other countries. If they make an attractive proposal, I assure you his Majesty
will offer more. 」</p>



<p>After hearing that gracious offer, I realize that I have become
a human strategic weapon. </p>







<p>When I realize that I don’t know anything about the House of
Dolknes’ faction, I asked her Majesty a question. She took her time to replied.</p>



<p>「House
of Dolknes that said pseudo-central nobles are part of the radical faction. </p>

<p>It was a coincidence since the Duke wanted to make the faction a
little bigger, and they wanted to join the central faction. 」</p>



<p>House of Dolknes is part of the radical faction, and my family
was probably under the influence of Duke Hillrose.</p>



<p>「What
would you do if they said you’re going to be adopted or became someone from
Duke Hillrose family’s fiancée? 」</p>



<p>「Sent
House of Dolknes a royal order not to transfer Yumiela-san’s register elsewhere.</p>



<p>The other nobles will criticize this, but this gave you enough deadlines
until the academy graduation. 」</p>



<p>「That’s
enough time, your Majesty. 」</p>



<p>Let’s do something about my relationship with my parents before
I graduate.</p>







<p>「Yumiela-san,
what do you think of your parents? 」</p>



<p>Just when I’m worried and thinking about my relationship with my
parents’, her Majesty asked me about it.</p>



<p>「As
far as I remember, I’ve never met them before, so I can’t say anything.</p>



<p>They don’t seem to be good people. If I can cut off our relationship,
I will. 」</p>



<p>Ah, no wonder, I didn’t think I’ve ever met my parents. Hearing
what I said, the Queen takes a deep breath and looks sad.</p>



<p>「Is
that so&#8230;&#8230; if it’s okay with you, I can adopt&#8230;&#8230; no, Yumiela-san will
refuse, won’t you?</p>



<p>But, you can think of me as a mother. Please come and play whenever
you want. 」</p>



<p>Even if you said that I’m the one that feels bothered since my
mental age was over 30.</p>



<p>「Once
again, I feel grateful. I appreciate the thought. 」</p>







<p>After that, I talked about my life in Dolknes’ territory.</p>



<p>As my story continues, for some reason, the Queen looks sad, and
when it reached the fun part of leveling up (dungeon edition), the tears spill.</p>






<p>「I
will send one of his Majesty’s subordinate to the academy. If you have any
trouble, please tell him. 」</p>



<p>Somehow I was under the Queen’s protection, and I left the palace with a large amount of sweets.</p>
