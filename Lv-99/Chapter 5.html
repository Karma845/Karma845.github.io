<h3 class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre11">It’s Not Like I Hate It</strong></h3>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey sis, welcome back!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I got home, I immediately heard Uzuki’s voice calling out to me, which already sounded annoying even from a distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki was busy in the living room eating some snacks while holding her dog, Japii.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought about ignoring her and going back to my room quietly, but I felt like I would get in trouble if I didn’t say anything back, so I turned towards the living room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, Uzuki.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What is it, sis? Is it about Satsuki-senpai?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, It’s not!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I let out a loud voice, which startled Japii “</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Woof!</span></i><span class="calibre8">” He barked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh, it isn’t?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, you’re not that far off….. So I guess you’re not mistaken in a way?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As a big sister, I have to say this. Uzuki has a habit of jumping to her own conclusions and doing many unnecessary things in return. She’s made a couple mistakes solely due to this in her agent work, and dad gets quite mad at her for it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I cross my arms and stand in front of Uzuki with a serious face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That thing today was just me working on something the teacher had asked me to do, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I know. Satsuki-senpai is just a classmate, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, we’re just classmates.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki giggles, and says nothing more and nothing less.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It just so happens to be that Satsuki-kun is a member of the library committee and I just so happen to be on day duty today as well. There is nothing to cover up at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But you were blushing in the classroom, weren’t you, sis?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It was just very hot in the classroom!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Sure it wass!</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki teases me by pretending to slap my face with her hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I get emotional here, I’ll be in the exact position where Uzuki wants me to be. I put a piece of candy in my mouth to show that I have the presence of a big sister. In times like this, I need sugar to help my brain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah! That’s Japii’s snack!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought it was a snack, but when I bit into it, it felt strangely fishy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Ugh, </span></i><span class="calibre8">what’s wrong with me!?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Anyways! Stop messing around, Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Which one of us is the one messing around here? You ate dog food at the spur of the moment!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On Uzuki’s lap, who’s trying her hardest to hold back her laughter; Japii squealed, as if she thought her snack had been taken away from her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wh-Who’s getting full of herself here! </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Mou~!</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The bitterness of the coffee washes away the discomfort in my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">This is not right.</span></i><span class="calibre8"> I slap my cheeks, thinking that this will ruin my dignity as an elder sister. My face isn’t red, and I’m not flustered at all!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I posture myself neatly again and give my attention to Uzuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki. Don’t act so goofy when that’s the first time you’re meeting him. Isn’t that disrespectful to Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t care. It’s a good way to communicate with someone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki flatly retorts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It sounds like an insult to my poor communication skills, and I felt annoyed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Even if it </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is</span></i><span class="calibre8"> a good way, isn’t that a bit much? Fukase-kun was in distress the entire time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s normal. Are you a jomon or something?” (TLN:</span><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jomo/hd_jomo.htm)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre3"><span class="calibre8"> This is a jomon or smt https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jomo/hd_jomo.htm )</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She brazenly asked Satsuki-kun so many questions and, to top it off, she even held his hand when they had parted. I almost screamed when I saw that, but in Uzuki’s case, it was </span><span class="calibre8">a little too close for communication.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“All I did was hold Satsuki-kun’s hand by accident when he fell down!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, there’s an order to do so!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean, ‘order’? Do you want me to start an exchange diary with him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t nitpick at my words!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Saying this and that. That’s Uzuki’s usual way of speaking, and I always end up not being able to talk back with these moves of hers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai, he seems like a nice, cool person, don’t you think? He’s kind to a sister like me too and above all, he’s cool.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki, who was dressed in half pants, sits cross-legged on the sofa and looks up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry I’m like this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, boys like Satsuki-senpai are your type, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know!! What are you talking about!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So you don’t like Satsuki-senpai?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not that I don’t like him, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then why don’t you just?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s that supposed to mean…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What does Uzuki want me to say?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s as if I’m being subjected to a guided interrogation. I’m not the kind of person to have an agent as a sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You should be more honest with him. You’ve been like that since junior high school, haven’t you? That kind of attitude isn’t cute nowadays! It’s already 2021, right?” (TLN: Cute to me, but idk i’m an incel) (EDN: you probably are, yeah)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t deserve to have you talk to me like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Just because you’re an agent doesn’t mean you have to always be one, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That has nothing to do with this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt as if someone was looking straight inside my mind, and I turned my face away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘It’s your business, sis, but you don’t have to deny everything. You’ve been tsun-tsun all day, haven’t you? And not just about Satsuki-senpai.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki lowers her tone a bit from the bouncy-like voice she had earlier and talks as if she </span><span class="calibre8">understands how I feel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was supposed to be teasing me, but before I knew it, she had lowered her eyebrows and made a concerned face at me. I can’t get mad at her when she looks at me like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Do you enjoy teasing me that much?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not teasing you. I’m just trying to support my sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, Uzuki’s face turns into a serious one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is that a new kind of sarcasm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Unable to take Uzuki’s words in stride, I pout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not being sarcastic. It’s the first time I’ve seen you with someone else at school. You’ve always been alone since junior high school, and you don’t have any friends. You’ve always turned down requests from teachers, right? But today you’re…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew what Uzuki was going to say, so I stopped her from going on with it in a louder voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At this, Uzuki bent her mouth into a heel and hugged Japii to her chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I always try to break the air when something bad is said about me. It was the same when Satsuki-kun asked me so many questions after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m just trying not to show myself. I don’t want him to find out who I really am inside my heart, so </span><span class="calibre8">I deny him and everything he asks.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you know about this, Uzuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I know what I’m talking about! I want you to do what you want to do, sis! I don’t want you to be </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">forced to be alone! That’s why I say I’ll support you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s none of your business. I’m going back to my room.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took Uzuki’s last words in stride and left the living room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t get you sis! You’ve had too much coffee, you’ll never fall asleep!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With Uzuki’s childish abandonment in the background, I put my hand on my chest as I try to </span><span class="calibre8">climb the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">What I want to do–</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t want to understand what Uzuki was trying to tell me, but I knew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The person I was at school wasn’t me. Uzuki’s aware of that, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s why I didn’t want to see Uzuki at school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reason why I’m always alone at school is because it’s easier for me to work as an agent that way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Ever since I entered high school, I’ve been monitoring the vice principal and trying my utmost to not get involved with anyone else. Calling It professionalism may be an exaggeration, but this was my clumsy way of dealing with what I was given.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But Uzuki always acts the same, both at home and at school. She will always be the Uzuki I know. She doesn’t seem to take her work as an agent seriously, and it feels more like a part-time job when she does that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t blame Uzuki for that. I want Uzuki to remain Uzuki, and that’s why I, as the eldest daughter, have to take over the agent’s job in her stead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Even with her support, there’s nothing I can do about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I mumbled softly and leaned my head against the wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was happy to work alone with Satsuki today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki was right. If it wasn’t for Satsuki, I would have definitely turned sensei down. I’ve been running away from relationships like that ever since junior high school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I might have been in a good mood at that time, in that place being alone with him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But then Uzuki suddenly interrupted me and started to be friendly to Satsuki, so I was a little jealous. She even held his hand. What was that “</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">please call me Uzuki</span></i><span class="calibre8">“?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m jealous of Uzuki who can say something like that so casually. I was just taking it out on her, wasn’t I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I had been more honest, would we have had a more normal conversation with each other?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe tomorrow I’ll have a little more courage and talk to him myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe I could at least say hey to him…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I thought about Satsuki-kun, I heard that sound again from the back of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My heart is screaming something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was beginning to realize that there was already a more positive feeling in my heart than when I last thought about Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
