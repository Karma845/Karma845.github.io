<h2>Prologue</h2>


<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Spring winds always haunt me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The breeze ruffles the classroom curtains, beckoning me to look at her as she quietly takes her class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m curious how many times I’ve looked at her. My heart skips a beat every time she sits by the window, her dark hair tucked behind her ear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I rest my cheek on my desk, listening to the ancient literature lesson in my ear, and keep an eye on Kinoshita-san, the school’s most beautiful girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san then slowly turns around, as if she had noticed something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When our gazes met, she looked surprised, but the next thing I knew, she was glaring at me with a wrinkle between her brows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san immediately turned her head forward and brushed her hair over her ears in a more exaggerated motion than before, and I awkwardly looked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I caught a glimpse of her ear, which was slightly reddish in color.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Are you paying attention, Fukase Satsuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The teacher abruptly calls out my name, and I respond in hushed tones. Laughter escapes the classroom, and I look down at my notebook quickly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretend to read my textbook as the class moves along with a fluffy feeling, but all the while I’m thinking about Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What am I going to do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I found myself following her back with my eyes during class and during breaks in second grade because we were in the same class. However, there was a reason for this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi Kinoshita might like me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s her secret, and I’m the only one who knows it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But the distance between me and Kinoshita-san appears to be both close and far. I can’t approach her now that I know her secret, and I can only hope for the best from afar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Today, too, all I can do is wait for something to happen in the back of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I just know that this feeling in my chest isn’t caused by the spring breeze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7">TL Afterword: I am currently working on more chapters to upload, same with Girl Who Can Read People’s Minds. The chapter upload rate has been really slow since me and my editor currently have exams rn, but I’ll do my best to churn out more so deal with it.</p>
