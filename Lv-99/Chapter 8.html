<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 8 - Uzuki's Request</h1>

<h3 class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre11">Uzuki’s Request</strong></h3>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The day after Kinoshita-san had done a sort of one-on-one stake out to Power Recorder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was lunchtime and I was on my way to the purchasing department when I heard someone call out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I turned around at the sound of the voice and saw a girl running up to me at a high speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, Uzu…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just as I was about to raise my right hand to greet her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Heyaaa!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Bwahhh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan rammed her way into my bare body at full speed. Her shoulder hit my crotch, and I fainted in agony.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What a bizarre attack, what a strange first contact to have!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai! You’re free right now, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hi… not that I’m not busy, but… What’s up?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I answer, rubbing my tackled belly. If it was after lunch had ended, I’m sure I would have thrown up…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So you’re not busy? Then let’s go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan, oblivious to the others around us, entwines her hands around my right arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wa-wa-wa! Wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not waiting!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She forcefully pulls me along with her, drawing attention to ourselves in the hallway during the lunch break.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is the second time we have met, but this familiarity and distance…! I was taken to the piloti on the first floor of the school building.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was cloudy and chilly today, and even though it was lunchtime, there was no one seated on the benches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so embarrassed that I didn’t know if I could take her with me or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was shorter than Kinoshita-san, and her blouse was unbuttoned at the neck-end, and her school uniform was well worn. Her skirt seems shorter than the last time I saw her. </span><span class="calibre8">She should be a first-year student who just entered the school, but her power as a high school girl has already increased even further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It really makes me think that this blushing Uzuki-chan isn’t an agent at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong, Uzuki-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I have a favor to ask of you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan folds her hands behind her waist and looks up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her bangs shifted, revealing a glimpse of her cute forehead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes! You, Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t feel like I can say no to anything she asks me to do, given her energy and the way she looks me in the eye like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean by ‘a favor’?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know if I should call it a favor or a suggestion actually.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Actually, it’s… Put your ear over here!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She put her hand to the side of her mouth and suddenly lowered her voice as if she was talking with someone secretly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I bend down and tenderly offer her my ear, and she pulls her face close to mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s about my sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan’s request. It was about Kinoshita-san it seems.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ki-Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I had returned the message calmly, but my voice had flipped a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I can’t talk about it here. You’re free after school today, right, of course?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan continues to speak softly with seriousness in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Apparently, she thinks I’m a guy who’s always busy. I’m actually a guy with a lot of free time on his hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I have some… free time, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then please go out with me after school. I’ll give you the details then!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I said I’ll go with you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yesterday after school I was with the older sister, and today I’ll be hanging out with the younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll be waiting for you just outside the shoe box! Oh, be sure to come carefully, so that my sister doesn’t spot you. It’ll be a lot of trouble if she notices you. Goodbye!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">All I could do was watch Uzuki-chan leave with her hair bouncing about as she struck a quick bow and ran off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the end, while I was being ambushed by Uzuki-chan, the bread in the store had sold out, and I was left without having my lunch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I stumbled my way back to class, the damage from the tackle and the conversation I had just had hit me hard on my stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A request about Kinoshita-san?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But why me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was walking through the school building at lunchtime, lost in thought, I saw a familiar figure coming from across the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That presence and aura, clearly visible even from quite a distance, made me stop in my tracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t believe I ran into her immediately after meeting with Uzuki-chan during my lunch break. I struggle to switch my atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When she finally got close enough to hear my voice, Kinoshita-san stopped, while paying attention to her surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without changing her expression, she responds back in a calm and composed manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her cheeks were flushed, and her gaze is going about here and there, it’s just on the edge of glaring at me and also not at the same time. It must be some kind of reflex action when she sees me. I wonder if this is intentional, Kinoshita-san?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, no, nothing…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I choke on my words at the sudden encounter with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yesterday’s events were still gripping me tightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember I had been upset because I remembered what happened at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then, it was Kinoshita-san who broke the silence between us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, I think I disturbed you yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san’s eyes were downcast while she brushed her hair over her ears. Her long eyelashes seem to bend downwards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m the one who made you come along though…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I touch my hair to hide my nervousness as she unexpectedly speaks to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was my fault for following Kinoshita-san. I wonder if she is no longer suspicious of me? We are careful not to touch each other’s confidential details after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, yes. The CD you recommended yesterday; I looked it up on the Internet and listened to it…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh, no bra?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uhm, yes… That.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps embarrassed to mention the abbreviation verbally, Kinoshita-san pauses her mouth briefly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I returned home, I found that my sister Sanae had already bought a CD by  Northern Brand, so we now had two copies of the exact same CD in our house. Of course, I couldn’t claim the money from Sanae after that, and she took the bonus clear file away from me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll lend you the CD if you like!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, thank you. Well then, see you”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san walked right past me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, I felt like I was having a real conversation with her for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This morning, Kinoshita-san greeted me again, and I wondered if this might mean that she had forgiven me a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Knowing Kinoshita-san’s true feelings, it has been difficult for me to approach her, but I am happy that we can have a normal conversation like this from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wonder if Kinoshita-san has had a change of heart…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe that has something to do with Uzuki-chan’s favor later today?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I looked back, Kinoshita-san was already gone. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was gone like the wind, without a single footstep echoing out loud, as usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san was the first to leave the classroom after SHR. (TLN: There’s like tons of stuff with the acronym SHR out there, maybe School Home Room?)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was thinking about how to avoid being noticed by Kinoshita-san since I was about to meet up with Uzuki-chan, but it seems like my fears were unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">During the afternoon class, I kept thinking about what Uzuki-chan was going to ask me to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know a lot about the Kinoshita sisters through my psychometry, but Uzuki-chan has no way of knowing about that. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She just happened to see me the other day, and she probably thinks of me as just a friend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Isn’t it strange that she wanted to talk to me though?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Being invited by Uzuki-chan at this point in time is not a very positive thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not like she’s going to say, “If you mess with my sister, I’ll kill you,” or something like that, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I would derive the possibility of blackmail in the name of asking for a favor. No, I would be happy if it ended in blackmail actually.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The sisters are agents, after all. They must have many identities that they don’t want me to know about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder if Uzuki-chan has found out that I know that the Kinoshita family are agents. And they are trying to make me disappear to protect the family’s secret…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, Satsuki. Aren’t you going home now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As the word “assassination” came to mind and began giving me the chills, Mayama spoke to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t want to go home anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s up with that? Well whatever. See you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama, completely oblivious to the danger to my life, quickly left the classroom. He’s such a heartless man. Even though a friend of his is suffering so much over here!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, there’s no way I can even talk to Mayama about this kind of thing. The problem is that it’s a secret that only I know about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sitting at my desk in the classroom, I close my eyes and suffer in anguish. I never thought that I would be so troubled by the fact that my classmate is an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">An agent would have no trouble erasing a person who knows about their secret. They’ll take me to a warehouse or something in the harbor and dump me straight into the </span><span class="calibre8">ocean. Am I going to disappear with the red tide in the Seto Inland Sea?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to end up like a supporting character dying early in a crappy B-movie! (TLN: more like crappy Bee movie am i right, k i’ll leave)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Gahh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly a voice calls out to me, and I almost flip over from my chair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I manage to grab onto the desk and look up toward the voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It was getting late, so I came to get you. I’ve been thinking about you all day. What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It wasn’t the assassin… but Uzuki-chan was looking down at me with a smiling face and the same vivid smile she had shown me earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Was she unaware of the cause of my problems, or was she smiling despite knowing all that?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“U-Uzuki-chan.. Oh, no, I was just about to go to…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I reposition myself so that the other party doesn’t realize that I was a bit suspicious of them being an agent, I notice that I’m getting a lot of attention from my classmates altogether.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Who’s that girl?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Looks like a freshman. She knows about Fukase?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where would he go after school with a girl that cute? I smell a crime!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not what you think!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m rather freaked out by the smell of crime in a completely different way. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m about to get erased, remember?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But it’s no wonder the class is buzzing currently. I always hang out with boys like Mayama, but here was this cute underclassman who came and greeted me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But how should I explain this situation? Introducing her as. Kinoshita-san’s younger sister seems like a bad idea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If it were known that Kinoshita-san has a younger sister, she would surely be the center of attention tomorrow onwards. This would be the situation that Kinoshita-san hates the </span><span class="calibre8">most.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even if it were just a matter of time, the gap between the two sisters would attract attention. And she would be staring at me again. This much is certain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was pondering about what to do, Uzuki-chan stepped out in front of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m Uzuki Kinoshita, Yayoi Kinoshita’s younger sister. Everyone, my sister is in your care!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan began to introduce herself, bowing her head in various directions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At this, my classmates looked at each other in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really, Kinoshita-san’s…?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A nearby girl comes up to her, looking at Uzuki-chan seriously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I am! Please take care of my sister!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While the classroom was stunned by the gap between the Kinoshita sisters, Uzuki-chan was the only one who repeatedly greeted them with a charming smile. This is the natural sunny side of Uzuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I mean, is this all right? Isn’t your sister going to be mad at you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was fumbling around, she grabbed my bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Let’s go, Satsuki-senpai!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you all for your hard work!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uh, oh, yes…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She pulled my bag with a yank and I was forcibly led out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I finally settled down after a short run down the hallway and onto the escalator.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, Uzuki-chan. Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Those words included my concern for Kinoshita-san and, of course, my personal safety.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“As a little sister, I should at least say hello to everyone. She’s the one who’s out of place in class anyways, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I raised my eyebrows as I folded my hands behind my hips and saw nothing wrong with her words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She seemed to know all about her sister’s situation in class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then it’s too much to ask that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sure I’ll be fine. She’s a very caring sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki looks away a little after saying that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She doesn’t seem to be making fun of Kinoshita-san, although the relationship between the sisters is still hard for me to grasp. She was probably acting that way on purpose, whilst thinking of her sister. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There is a fine line between meddling and being considerate of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I changed my shoes at the shoe locker and walked out of the school gate, with Hiroshima Castle towering in front of me across the moat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“This way, this way!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I silently follow Uzuki-chan as she starts walking in the opposite direction of the station, having no idea where we were headed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Seriously, I have a faint fear in my mind that I might be taken to the harbor and get disposed of quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t think that the kind and sisterly Uzuki-chan would do that, but she </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is</span></i><span class="calibre8"> an agent, so she might keep her business and private life completely separate…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“By the way, what’s your request? You said it was about Kinoshita-san, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t stand still and so I asked Uzuki-chan, who was walking ahead of me, what she wanted of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t be in such a hurry. Right, please tell me about Otomachi High School, okay? You seem to have a lot of friends, don’t you, Satsuki-senpai? Are you enjoying your high </span><span class="calibre8">school life?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan starts to ask various questions as if to silence my hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t have that many friends.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re so shy. You don’t have a girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t have a girlfriend, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really? Good news, good news!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan claps her hands in excitement. What does that mean…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“How about you, Uzuki-chan? Are you enjoying being a high school student?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s hard for me to be bombarded with questions like this, so I ask her back in self-defense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Me? I’m having a lot of fun so far! I feel like I’m finally a high school girl!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan turns to me and spreads the skirt of her school uniform to show off her dress. My gaze was drawn towards the glimpse of her thighs. (TLN: No comments)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m Kinoshita-san’s little sister, so don’t even think about it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ack! it’s good that you are having fun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Isn’t it fun for you too, Satsuki-senpai?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I give back an ambiguous response, she immediately cuts me off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I’m not saying that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“If you don’t have fun, you’re missing out. If you don’t do what you want to do, your high school will be over before you know it, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, that’s right…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I manage to raise the corners of my mouth and show my composure as an upperclassman. I can’t let Uzuki-chan, who just entered the school, tell me off about my high school life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, what’s your request?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In an attempt to rewind back, I forced myself to get back on track.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not like Kinoshita-san, but I feel exhausted talking with Uzuki-chan. It’s as if she’s looking straight into my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well. It’s about my sister. Satsuki-senpai, have you noticed anything about her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a snap of her fingers, things finally got down to business, but then she started to say something cryptic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stopped in my tracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> “Noticed what…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I let out a choked voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You two are in the same class, did you notice anything strange about her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She looks me carefully up and down, and I let my gaze wander off into the sky to cover it up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure she’s talking about her job as an agent?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is she playing a trick on me to get rid of me now that I know the Kinoshita family’s secret?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Unwanted thoughts run through my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If this aggressive attitude of Uzuki-chan’s is a trap to get me to let my guard down, then I’m in trouble. Was the thigh glimpse I saw earlier also a honey trap?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What am I supposed to do? If I don’t keep my mind steady, I’m definitely going to faint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Are you okay, Satsuki-senpai?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I froze up, but Uzuki-chan was coming on to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I clutch my left hand tightly in my pocket. My palms were drenched in sweat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I didn’t notice anything special but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course I’m aware of it, but how can I tell the truth to her?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know too much. I know too much about Kinoshita-san, thanks to the psychometric abilities of my left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…I see. Sis, I thought she was only different whenever she was with Satsuki-senpai.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan, her shoulders slumped as if she had lost her mind, as she mumbled ruefully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Eh, what do you mean?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, she’s always alone at school, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The tone of Uzuki’s voice had dropped down a notch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Being alone… Yes, that’s true…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She’s just pushing herself too hard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Pushing herself? Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan nodded her head in a small way and blinked her eyes as she did so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The story is taking a completely different turn from what I had expected.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You’re not suspecting me, are you? Aren’t you trying to make me disappear from this world?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, she has always been alone at school ever since junior high school. She doesn’t make friends and intentionally keeps other people away from her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In response to my question, Uzuki started to up her pace as if she were searching for words to describe something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What she’s saying about Kinoshita-san is true. After all, she does have a “stay away from me” kind of aura emanating from her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But that’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I almost said, ‘That’s because she tries to act alone to make it easier for the agents to do their work,’ but I swallowed my words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have to pretend that I don’t know anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, Kinoshita-san, why would she do that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s because, well, circumstances…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was not sure what to say, but I had to pretend I didn’t know anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The circumstances are obviously about her work as an agent, but I can’t pursue the matter any further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“My big sister at school isn’t really my big sister. I want her to be more friendly with everyone, but she’s just not honest, so she’s like that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki’s words, “</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">really my big sister</span></i><span class="calibre8">,” were stuck in my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The back of Uzuki walking in front of me, I can see through her thoughts. She’s not acting as an agent right now, but as a caring sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For a while, I couldn’t find the words to say to her, so we walked at a leisurely pace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We were walking in the direction of a residential area without even knowing where we were going.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then, as if she were motivated, </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan turned around and called my name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Y-Yes!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so careless that I thought I was no longer in danger of being assassinated that I almost bumped into her and responded reflexively.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan stared at me, her mouth slightly twisted. Her eyes were strong and determined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you think about my sister?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wh-What do you mean…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t dislike her, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yeah, I don’t hate her, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is</span></i><span class="calibre8"> beautiful, isn’t she? Unlike me, she’s tall and beautiful with pretty long hair.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“W-Well…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her pure eyes were staring straight at me and her straightforward question left me at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What’s with all this angry sissy appeal?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The last time she was with Satsuki-senpai, she seemed to be having a good time, wasn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That time, she was just one-sidedly pissed off…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That time was when we were working together after school. I tried to make conversation with her, but Kinoshita-san just ignored me and glared at me, and I was dispirited by </span><span class="calibre8">that…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s not true. That day, when she came back home, she was so excited that she ate dog food by accident.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Do-Dog food?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Did Kinoshita-san get carried away and eat dog food by mistake?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t tell if that was a joke or the truth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She has never been alone with a boy like that before, working together after school. Not a single time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think this is something Kinoshita has consciously kept in mind as an agent. She doesn’t make friends and stays alone all the time because that’s her job as a professional.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I think she accepted the job because she was going to be with Satsuki-senpai”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, it was due to me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki nodded heavily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember the first time I met Kinoshita-san. On the day of the school festival, I heard that voice in her mind when our hands touched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Satsuki-kun, you’re so cool.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was sure she was thinking of me. (TLN: No s**t)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the middle of a quiet residential area, I just held my breath so that no one could hear my heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I think Satsuki-senpai can open my sister’s heart.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san’s… open her heart…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki crackled and blinked, looking a little lost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Yes. Currently, Sis is closing her heart from everyone. She’s been pushing herself all the time, and she’s definitely not having fun being like that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki’s voice is getting quieter as she continues on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not sure if that’s what you mean but, do you want Kinoshita-san to be able to blend in with the class?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“There’s that too… I’d like her to do what she really wants to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What she really wants to do…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I repeat the words back like an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I know she can’t do what she truly wants to do and so she’s always holding herself back. I’m sure that in front of Satsuki-senpai, she can be honest with herself. Because </span><span class="calibre8">you’re…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan bowed her head and said nothing more, or perhaps she couldn’t say anything else. She seemed to be silently pleading something to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is her job as an agent the reason she’s always alone, but is she actually holding herself back because there is something else she really wants to do? Is the real Kinoshita-san not </span><span class="calibre8">the real Kinoshita-san I know of right now…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan is also trying her best to communicate with me, despite the fact that there are things that she can’t say about her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I stitch together the pieces of her words, I reach a conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san, doesn’t want to be an agent?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But how can I…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even if she doesn’t want to be an agent, is there anything I can do to help her out? Knowing Kinoshita-san’s secret, that exact secret is getting in the way right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, don’t think too hard. I want you to be more friendly with my sister. If you don’t mind, Satsuki-senpai, then…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course I don’t dislike it! But being more friendly with Kinoshita-san is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course I want to get along with her. I know what Kinoshita-san is really thinking, so it’s a match I wouldn’t normally lose.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But that’s not the case here. The unique situation of her being an agent is getting in the way of me helping her out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san is trying so hard to be an agent that she always acts extremely salty toward me as a result. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even if I tried to be friendly with her, I don’t think she would go easy on me in the slightest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The face of Kinoshita-san that suddenly pops into my mind is always staring at me. The faintly reddening of her cheeks is my only hope, but the light of hope is too small at </span><span class="calibre8">present.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll be right behind you two, too!” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“They say you should never be in a hurry to fall in love, but I don’t think you’ll be hurt if you walk too fast in this situation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan clenches both her fists tightly and says something both sweet and sour.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, love is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was too embarrassed to go further into it, so I stopped talking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder how much Uzuki-chan is aware of this?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She is such a charming first-year student, but she is also an agent. It’s hard to take her words at face value, and so I ended up searching behind her words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, I think I can avoid being dumped into the Seto Inland Sea after being stuffed into concrete today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, this was my request. Please take good care of my sister from now on!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan bowed politely with both hands in front of her body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s my pleasure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not sure what the significance is, but I bowed back to her as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We smiled at each other, amused by this strange scene in a quiet residential neighborhood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am certain that Kinoshita-san likes me, and Uzuki-chan seems to be aware of her sister’s feelings as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In addition, she has declared that she will support Kinoshita-san, so that she can do what she wants to do, and what she wants to do is to… that is, get together with me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No-no-no, what does that mean?!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“By the way, would you like to come by our house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What? Your… Your house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, our house.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki raised her right hand and pointed towards a house. It was a stylish two-story house with white walls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is this your house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That is to say, it was also Kinoshita-san’s house. It was no surprise since they’re both sisters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before we knew it, we were in front of Kinoshita-san’s house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It never occurred to me that Kinoshita-san’s house was within walking distance from the school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I think my sister is probably home too. Since we’ve come all this way, shall we go and see her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan nodded her head, as if enjoying the surprise she put onto me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No-no, I’ll get in trouble if you do that!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, it was Kinoshita-san who would be upset.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wave my hands and instinctively back away from her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why doesn’t she make a move on Satsuki-senpai’s as soon as possible? They say love acts quite fast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What did you just say? Uzuki-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought you said that love was never rushed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What on earth do you expect from me and Kinoshita-san, Uzuki-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I think my sister would be thrilled, wouldn’t you be too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Looking up at the second floor of her home, Uzuki-chan murmurs disappointingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, you’d definitely get a kick out of that, wouldn’t you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If she knew that I had suddenly appeared at their house, she would definitely have stared at me like an Asura.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to leave here. Bye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But there was no doubt that she was inwardly interested in us meeting each other. This is Kinoshita-san’s house, and it’s also the house where the agent’s family lives. I wonder if there are any hidden doors or tricks present here?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry to hear that, but thank you for your time today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki did not seem to want to hold back any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s hard to judge what she’s actually saying and what’s a joke from her mouth…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to turn around to go back the way I came from.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki, are you home?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was messing around in front of the house when the front door suddenly opened. The voice coming from there made me and Uzuki-chan turn around at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ki-Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At the entrance stood Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and she was wearing a black top and bottom jersey. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was holding a small black dog on her chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the first time I had seen Kinoshita-san without her uniform, and it was a refreshing look, but I didn’t have time to take in the feeling right now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san was staring at me silently, as if she had just seen a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, sis! I’m home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki waved her hand in a cheerful voice as her sister greeted her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At the same time, the dog jumped out of Kinoshita-san’s arms, who froze, and ran to </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan’s feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? Ehhhh? Why…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san stares at me in front of her house. She looked at me not once, but twice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> “Um… I’m home. I mean, hi, long time no see?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was confused. We had met in the classroom just a few minutes ago, but I didn’t expect to see her again so soon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why is Fukase-kun at our house? What’s the meaning of this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san, who recognized my face, was clearly upset, unable to grasp the situation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san! Um, Uzuki-chan…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh yeah, I was just about to leave when I ran into him! It just so happened that we decided to go home together!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan interrupts my words and tries to put up a good front instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why are you going home with him? Why is he coming to our house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Unsettled, Kinoshita-san glares at me repeatedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew she was pissed at me! That sucks!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, what are you going to do about it? Do you want to ask Satsuki-senpai to come up?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are you talking about? I’m going to go change!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With that said, Kinoshita-san ran up the stairs in embarrassment, perhaps realizing that she was still in her jersey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The dog held by Uzuki-chan was also frightened, making a pathetic “</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">kuun</span></i><span class="calibre8">” sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, didn’t she look happy to see you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Pointing at Kinoshita-san back at the house, Uzuki-chan smiles wickedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What part of her looked happy to you? She was seriously pissed off, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She’s embarrassed that you saw her in her loungewear. Isn’t that kind of thing cute?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t respond back in any way and so I returned a drawn-out smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s now Uzuki-chan’s turn all the way. Please don’t agitate her any further!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m leaving while I still can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t worry about it. Oh, here’s Japii. Please give him a hug.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I waited for Kinoshita-san to return, Uzuki-chan forcibly handed me the dog, Japii.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Cu-Cute”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Strange name, isn’t it? My sister named him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I petted Japii’s head and her tail wagged in the air. Unlike his owner, he’s a very friendly dog.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, having the dog in my hands, I couldn’t go home. Had Uzuki-chan anticipated this? </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What a schemer! I’m being rolled in the palm of Uzuki-chan’s hand!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“By the way, this is what I was talking to you about earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put my index finger in front of my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I closed my mouth tightly and nodded my head again and again. Japii looked at me and barked a single “arff!</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the meantime, the front door opened again and Kinoshita-san had returned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, she was dressed in her school uniform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Why are you changing into your uniform again?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It doesn’t matter. Uzuki, can you explain this to me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san stared straight at me while talking to Uzuki-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What am I supposed to do? I was here completely uninvited, wasn’t I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Since he’s come all this way, don’t get mad at him. Please come in. There’s cake in the fridge, please come in and have a break.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki was trying to get me to come over to her house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s my cake!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t care, it’s just one cake. Satsuki-senpai is a guest. Right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why are you being so unreasonable…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan winks at me, but an endless glare comes at me from the other side. The sisters’ attitude is so gruesome! Just when I thought I was having a tropical vacation, I could </span><span class="calibre8">feel the tundra blowing right next to me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san! I’m leaving. It’s not your fault, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While protecting Uzuki-chan, all I could do was leave the place as fast as I could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, my god, Sis. Satsuki-senpai is going home. Do you really want him to leave?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So what? Totally… </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">mou~~!</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san was standing with her arms crossed. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had come to this house without her knowledge or consent, so it was only natural that she would lose her temper. The two sisters were now fighting without any honor and </span><span class="calibre8">dignity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uhm, well then, I’ll take my leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to give Japii back to Uzuki-chan when he suddenly popped out of my arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We both shouted at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><span class="calibre8">What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Japii was wearing a collar but not a leash. Japii landed on the road, and with the three of us panicking, he wagged his tail with a look that said, </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He could have run away at any time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Japii, come here!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san also came out of the doorway and called out to Japii.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt responsible for letting her escape from my arms, so I slowly approached Japii.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Surrounded by the three of us, Japii seems to have sensed the atmosphere and looks around at us with his tail perked up. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then he kicked his hind legs and tried to escape from in between me and Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan shouted and I jumped on Japii who was trying to escape from us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san’s hand reached out from the other side, but I caught Japii as I covered him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We did it…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I held Japii’s fluffy body firmly with both my hands so that he wouldn’t escape this time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai, niceu~!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry, Uzuki-chan. I was careless.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I had let him go, Kinoshita-san would have glared at me again. I glanced at her face and saw…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Either way, she was still staring at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, I’m really leaving now. I’m sorry, Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t let him get away this time, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to hand Japii to Kinoshita-san when suddenly…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My left hand touched Kinoshita-san’s hand on the fluffy Japii’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Psychometry never misses a single moment, does it. Regardless of my intentions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Why do you call Uzuki by her name, but me Kinoshita-san!’</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Eh, are you mad, is that it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I was puzzled, she snatched Japii away from me, and I looked at Kinoshita-san’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is she mad or jealous?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps it’s jealousy. I sure hope it is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san… no, Yayoi-chan, instantly glared at me with a grimace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t think I can call her Yayoi-chan under these circumstances, so from now on, I’ll call her that secretly inside my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, nothing. I’m sorry to bother you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I ran out in front of the Kinoshita house as if to escape from both of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai, please come again!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had a feeling that I would never come back here again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My stay here only lasted a couple of minutes. My first time in front of the Kinoshita family house was as fast as a roller coaster ride.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Under the sunset, I was back in front of Otomachi High School. I had no idea that Yayoi-chan’s house was so close by. As expected of an agent’s family, they live in a really nice </span><span class="calibre8">place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Putting aside the fact that I had psychometricized Yayoi-chan, Uzuki-chan asked me to do something for her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘I want you to open your heart to my sister.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was shocked. The Yayoi-chan I had seen at school was not the real Yayoi-chan this whole while.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The Yayoi-chan who’s always alone, closed-minded, and giving up on things she wants to do because she’s an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How can she not get along with anyone in class because of her agent job?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My heart aches when I think about how Yayoi-chan feels. If I could help her out, I definitely would.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But what should I do…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I look up at the sky and the beautiful sunset casts a long shadow on my back. I am sure that somewhere in this red sky, the moon is also floating somewhere in the skyline.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just like the moon in the daytime, the real Yayoi-chan is not visible right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Can I shine a light on her? </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Can I find the real Yayoi-chan that’s hidden behind her facade?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What I can really do for her is…</span></p>
