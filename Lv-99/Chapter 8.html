<h1>Chapter 08: The New Principal</h1>
    	
<p>After school, the teacher informed me that the principal
summoned me, so I went to the academy’s drawing-room. What does that old man
want? Perhaps he bought the story about me as the Demon King. </p>



<p>But the man who was waiting in the drawing-room wasn’t the old
man whom I had expected.</p>







<p>「Nice
to meet you, Yumiela-san. My name is Ronald, and I’m the new academy principal.
」</p>



<p>「Nice
to meet you too, my name is Yumiela Dolknes. Ano, where’s the former principal?
」</p>



<p>「Due
to some circumstances, the old principal decided to retire. You don’t need to
worry about it since you won’t see him again. 」</p>



<p>Said the new principal, Ronald, smiling sweetly. Compared to his
predecessor, he’s very young. He looks like in his thirty.</p>



<p>His smile looks fake; it’s the kind of smile you use to give
someone a sense of security, and he’s quick to give it. </p>







<p>「I
came to the school under her Majesty’s orders. You can rest assured that I know
about the rumored Demon King. 」</p>



<p>It looks like he was the person that the Queen was speaking
about. For him to know about the Demon King’s revival, it implies that he has
his Majesty’s trust. </p>



<p>「I
was troubled with Prince Edwin too. To talk about state secrets in the presence
of the general public&#8230; It will be a disaster. 」</p>


	


<p>I thought about the present situation where almost every student
in the academy physically avoiding me. Ronald keeps on speaking with a bitter
look on his facial expression. </p>



<p>「And
I can’t say that his Highness has a quick temper. How should I put it&#8230; Recently,
he’s been having a temper and grouchy? Those two guys that usually support him are
the same. 」</p>



<p>「What
happened to them? 」</p>



<p>Something that made them unstable must’ve happened recently. Most
likely, it was because of me.</p>







<p>「Hahaha,
why did you say that?</p>



<p>Well, let’s talk about their situation. His Highness and his two
friends didn’t have any problem. He had been an excellent child and was ahead
of his peers. At the same time, he had high self-esteem; it didn’t really have a
bad effect on him since he never knows defeat. </p>



<p>Then, a person who can destroy their pride appeared. And they didn’t
want to admit it. They think someone who can defeat themselves as the Demon
King, just to make it bearable in their mind. 」</p>







<p>As I thought, is it because of me?</p>



<p>I know the situation that happens is very different from the
game scenario.</p>



<p>I didn’t expect things would go according to the scenario, but
if it changed from the beginning, there might be more or less significant impact.</p>







<p>「I
could understand their situation, but how about all the students that become
afraid of me? 」</p>



<p>「Once
the rumor spread, it’s almost impossible to get rid of it. The official will deny
the story about the Demon King’s revival, and there will be many who still believe
it. </p>



<p>You better remember that it’s impossible to wipe out the rumor
about you as well. Not that I deny the credibility of your strength. And some
people in the royal palace fear that you’re a dangerous person. 」</p>



<p>Well, I can see from their perspective, I’m a mystery person
with Level 99 that suddenly appeared. </p>



<p>「I
don’t think there are many people who don’t fear you. Even I was a little
afraid of you. 」</p>



<p>Without showing any sign of fear, the principal said that. Now I’m
the one that afraid of his never-ending scary smile. </p>







<p>「Ah, rest assured his Majesty knows that you aren’t the Demon King. 」</p>



<p>When he said that, it was so sure that there was no question from
the beginning, his Majesty thinks that Demon King’s revival will occur in two
years after. </p>



<p>Was there any solid evidence that I’m not the Demon King?</p>



<p>「Does
the royal family know the details about the Demon King? 」</p>



<p>「No
comment. 」</p>



<p>He answered with a more profound smile. Are you implicitly
saying yes? </p>







<p>Principal Ronald has been around in Prince Edwin’s childhood,
and he is well-versed with the information that is only available to his
Majesty’s thought and the leaders of the country. </p>



<p>Maybe when he was young, he had a prominent position. It is also
bothering me when he didn’t use his family name in his self-introduction. </p>


	





<p>I was wondering who he was, and he seems able to look through
someone’s head. </p>



<p>「I’m
just an academy principal. I’ll also be your liaison to his Majesty.</p>



<p>If you have any questions to ask his Majesty, you can ask. Depending on your question, you can get an answer quickly. 」</p>



<p>Saying that I might get the answer immediately means that he is
authorized to have an audience with the King and have its own discretion. Ah,
he’s really someone in a higher position after all. </p>



<p>「You
are a human being, not just a weapon. The Queen was very worried about you. It
will make my job a lot easier. 」</p>



<p>I was like he was rereading my thoughts, I don’t answer, and my
facial expression didn’t change. </p>



<p>Uh, I don’t like this person&#8230; What if he found out about the
secret of my previous life?</p>







<p>「Now,
let’s talk about the future.</p>



<p>Today’s primary purpose is to get acquainted, so when the need arises,
we can work seamlessly. I wanted you to go to the field practice and managed it
from the side. 」</p>



<p>Field practice is basically leveling up. Thinking about the
students’ safety, the academy gave them a solution to hunt monsters safely.</p>



<p>I wonder if I will help to assist Prince Edwin and friends
raising their level for the Demon King subjugation. </p>







<p>「Hai,
I understand. Will I help to support his Highness? 」</p>



<p>「No,
that’s not your job. You will take part in a different party from his Highness.
」</p>



<p>It was odd, and he begins to question me.</p>



<p>「On
the other hand, can you cooperate and fight together with them? 」</p>



<p>Ah, so he was going to ask that. </p>



<p>「If
it’s a problem; it needs to be solved at some point. It’s hard to get along
right away. 」</p>



<p>As it is, we will not be able to defeat the Demon King together.
First, they have to realize that I’m an ally and I’m on their side.</p>







<p>「Okay.
But I had trouble with the grouping. 」</p>



<p>It’s obvious which one that will be selected, the group with the
popular prince or group with someone rumored to be the Demon King. </p>


	


<p>「I’m
going to divide the group using the usual way. I will divide it into central
nobles and local nobles. So, you’ll be in the local group. 」</p>



<p>「That’s
a broad way to divide the group. 」</p>



<p>「There’s
a good reason for it. The central nobles and the local nobles had a big
difference in their motivations to leveling up. 」</p>



<p>I understand, there are a few central nobles who proactive in
their endeavors to level up. After graduating from the academy, many of them
will be succeeded the family or became government officials. There are a few
advantages, no matter how high your level is. </p>



<p>On the other hand, the local nobles, particularly those with a
small territory, used to deal with the monsters on their territory by
themselves. The son who didn’t succeed in the family often became a soldier. </p>







<p>「Is
it fine to group his Highness with such an unmotivated group? 」</p>



<p>「I’m
planning to raise their level to level 40 in two years. 」</p>



<p>I’m unsure how you can fight against the Demon King at level 40.
Even the suitable level in the game was 60-70. </p>



<p>「Level
40&#8230; I’d like you to raise the level to 60 or so. 」</p>



<p>「Commander
Adolf level 60? It’s impossible in two years. 」</p>



<p>U—uhh, is it the best to raise their level to 40?</p>



<p>Well, with my support, it will be fine.</p>







<p>「I
understand. What exactly should I do? 」</p>



<p>「I
would like to ask you to lead the emergency support together with the teachers.
It rarely happens, but the place is in the forest on the outskirts of the royal
capital. 」</p>



<p>The forest in the suburb of the royal capital is the first stage
location in the game. All the monsters there look weak. I don’t think I’ll need
to do help with anything. </p>



<p>「I
just want to watch the battle without doing anything. 」</p>



<p>「That’s
right. I heard that your leveling up method is quite odd, please don’t do
anything strange? 」</p>



<p>Oh my, what’s wrong with my leveling method? Maybe it is strange
fighting alone without wearing protection charm. </p>





<p>It’s normal to blow the monster summoning flute, right?</p>
