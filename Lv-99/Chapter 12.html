<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 12: Gal and Sleepless Night</h1>


<p>It was already long past midnight. I got up from the sofa in the living room and conveyed this to Tsumakawa, my sister, who was in her pajamas.</p>

<p>“I’ve laid out a futon in the tatami room over there. Tsumakawa, you can sleep there.”</p>
<p>“…Is it not okay to sleep together in Yoda’s room?”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely not okay… I couldn’t just leave you alone, so I decided to let you stay at my place, but that’s different from this…”</p>
<p>“…Mm, okay.”</p>
<p>“You’re oddly obedient… yawn… Well then, I’m going to bed now…”</p>

<p>With a yawn, I said that and headed for the living room door, rubbing my eyes.</p>
<p>Apparently, after the eye-opening event of Tsumakawa-san taking a bath in my house, sleepiness has overtaken me.</p>
<p>As I left the living room and was about to exit, Tsumakawa stopped me in the corridor and said, in a voice that seemed like she was about to cry,</p>

<p>“Hey, where’s your goodnight?”</p>
<p>“Uh, goodnight…”</p>
<p>“Hehe… Well, goodnight.”</p>

<p>After taking ‘goodnight’ from me, Tsumakawa smiled faintly, then returned to the living room.</p>
<p>Watching her like that, I quietly let out a sigh and headed to my own room.</p>
<p>Upon entering my room, I flung myself onto the bed face-down.</p>

<p>“Sigh… Why did things end up like this?”</p>

<p>Staying overnight under the same roof as a cheerful gal classmate, Tsumakawa…</p>
<p>Even if I couldn’t abandon her when she was vulnerable, it might have been a bit rash. Actually, have I taken too much of a liking to Tsumakawa-san…?</p>
<p>She’s going to get tired of me and stop asking for me one day anyway————</p>

<p>“…Time to sleep.”</p>

<p>Before I started getting lost in unnecessary thoughts, I closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>Then, from somewhere, a soft, not too strong, citrusy fragrance wafted over——</p>
<p>Wait, what’s this smell?</p>
<p>For a moment, I wondered, but it was nothing more than the perfume Tsumakawa-san forcibly applied to me earlier, tickling my nostrils.</p>

<p>“…..”</p>

<p>Despite trying to ignore it, I became more aware of the scent, and in closing my eyes again, my sense of smell became more acute. The scent of her was even stronger now.</p>
<p>I was supposed to be sleeping alone, but I felt like Tsumakawa had climbed into my bed, and I was experiencing the sensation of sleeping together.</p>
<p>No, stop it! Don’t invade my brain, Imaginary Tsumakawa! ‘Hey, don’t get too friendly with other girls.’</p>
<p>…Why are you saying that now, Imaginary Tsumakawa?</p>

<p>And so, due to the perfume that Tsumakawa had applied, I spent over ten minutes in a restless state.</p>
<p>Gradually, I managed to get used to her scent, and the illusion of Tsumakawa sleeping next to me faded away.</p>
<p>I started to drift into a light slumber.</p>

<p>Then, from somewhere in the distance, I heard the creaking sound of a door opening.</p>
<p>Reflexively, I lifted my heavy eyelids slightly, struggling against drowsiness.</p>
<p>And then, there——</p>

<p>“…Huh?… Whoa!?”</p>
<p>“…yay….”</p>

<p>A ghost-gal who looked rather downcast was standing there, giving me a gal peace.</p>
<p>Wait, is that Tsumakawa…?</p>

<p>Just when I thought I could finally sleep, she enters someone else’s room without permission…</p>
<p>While I silently protested in my mind, she seemed to be continuing the scenario of standing at my dream pillow.</p>
<p>In a small, muffled voice, she said,</p>

<p>“…Stay where you are and listen to me. I am the ancestor of the Yoda family—My name is『Tae Yoda 』 and I’m about to grant you an important oracle…”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be kidding… My ancestor was a gal…?”</p>
<p>“Take good care of a girl named Miona Tsumakawa… She is your good luck charm… And surprisingly, she’s devoted… Even though she’s FJK, she’s still a virgin and doesn’t really restrict you, so become her boyfriend…”</p>
<p>“Aren’t the words you’re using a bit too modern…? Did the term ‘Boyfriend (Kare pi)’ even exist in your time?” (TN: She’s using Kare-pi instead of Kareshi.)</p>
<p>“Well then, I’m off to chill in the heavenly sauna… Take care and be well…”</p>
<p>“Huh… Wait, so heaven is like a sauna? Does that mean when we die, we go to a place called heavenly sauna?”</p>
<p>“No, Yoda… ‘Heaven’ is like a health spa where there are various facilities such as saunas, hot springs, banquet halls, and more…”</p>
<p>“So, heaven existed on Earth too!?”</p>
<p>(TN: First year students are referred to as “FJK” (first). 2nd year students are referred to as “SJK” (second). 3rd year students are referred to as “LJK” (last) )</p>

<p>Tsumakawa’s nonsense led me to reply with a silly remark, even in my not-yet-fully-awake mind.</p>
<p>In response, she let out a dry laugh, saying, ‘Ahaha.’</p>
<p>If you’re feeling down, don’t force yourself to be funny… I thought, rubbing my drowsy eyes a few times.</p>
<p>After that, I asked her:</p>

<p>“Um, Tsumakawa-san… What are you doing standing by my bedside?”</p>
<p>“…I can’t sleep, so I thought I’d be with you…”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to me like a kid who watches scary videos in the middle of the night…”</p>

<p>I sat up on my bed and looked at Tsumakawa, who was standing by the side.</p>
<p>With a somewhat gloomy expression, she gazed at my face with slightly moist eyes.</p>
<p>Worried about her fragile state, I said,</p>

<p>“Tsumakawa-san, have you checked your phone? It’s about to be past 2:30 AM.”</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. But… can you still stay with me for a bit longer?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>Seeing the clearly weakened Tsumakawa-san, with a face that looked like she might cry at any moment——once I had decided to support her, I couldn’t just do nothing.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, I can’t believe that just by being by her side, I can be of help.</p>
<p>But if Tsumakawa-san says she doesn’t want to be alone, then… Having decided earlier today to help her as much as possible, I should try my best to help her today.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I got up from my bed.</p>

<p>“Well, for now, should we head to the tatami room?”</p>
<p>“…Thanks, Yoda…”</p>
<p>“No problem, I don’t mind… I can tell you’ve had a rough day.”</p>
<p>“…Actually, could we sleep together in your bed instead of the tatami room?”</p>
<p>“Don’t get carried away just because I agreed to one request, okay?”</p>

<p>Upon my retort, she gave a small smile and said, ‘Since we decided to be together, I got a bit greedy… hehe.’ It was very much like Tsumakawa, a very gal-like way of extending her desires.</p>
<p>Thinking so, Tsumakawa and I left my room and headed to the tatami room adjacent to the living room.</p>
<p>Upon entering, she sat on the futon that was laid out, patting the space next to her.</p>
<p>I sat down cross-legged, slightly away from the spot she indicated.</p>
<p>She was sitting in a kneeling position on the futon, and with a voice that was almost pleading, she said,</p>

<p>“…Is it okay if I hold your hand?”</p>
<p>“Um, can you please stop with these unreasonable requests…”</p>
<p>“…sniff…”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san looked like she was about to cry after being rejected by me.</p>
<p>I just wanted to maintain a reasonable distance from her, but she looked like she was about to cry when I denied her request.</p>
<p>Come on, could you stop that? While thinking that internally, I desperately searched for a compromise within myself, and I ended up making this suggestion to Tsumakawa-san,</p>

<p>“Um, how about the sleeve? If it’s the sleeve of my pajamas, you can hold onto it!”</p>
<p>“Uh… okay.”</p>

<p>After a very small response, she gently pinched the cuff of my pajama sleeve.</p>
<p>With her cheeks slightly puffed out, she muttered, ‘Yeah, holding your hand is nice…’ But I firmly ignored that.</p>
<p>Huh? I can’t hear you.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g13.png" alt="" />

<p>And so, sitting side by side on the futon, we remained silent for a while, lost in our thoughts.</p>


<p>After a somewhat comfortable silence had lingered for a while… Tsumakawa suddenly muttered something with a voice that lacked energy.</p>
<p>It sounded like she was talking to herself, and it was somewhat inaudible.</p>

<p>“…Could I complain just a little bit?”</p>
<p>“…Sure, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks…”</p>

<p>I realized that my right sleeve was being tightly held once again.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t pay much attention to Tsumakawa and instead gazed at the faint moonlight streaming in through the window. She began to speak passionately.</p>
<p>It was a story about the conflict with her father that led her to stay over at my place today.</p>

<p>“…Deep down, I know that what Dad says is right.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“It’s my fault… because I didn’t obey the curfew, I made Dad say those things… Dad was wrong, but I’m the one who pushed him to say the wrong things, so I shouldn’t have run away from home or talked back to Dad. I knew that… But I had to get angry at that moment because I would have been disappointed in myself. It’s not like I was wrong too… I wonder if this is just me being selfish?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“To be honest, I really hate my Dad. I can’t stand going home and seeing his face, and sometimes I even wish he would just die — but if he really did, I think I’d cry a lot… uh, I don’t want my Dad to die with our relationship being like this. Well, the feeling of wanting him dead isn’t a lie, but only a little bit… still, I truly don’t want him to die… Ahahaha, I’m just talking without any understanding, aren’t I? My thoughts are so jumbled and unorganized.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“That’s why I think I want to get along with Dad… I want to stop genuinely hating him. When Dad is saying the right things, I want to acknowledge him. When he says something wrong, instead of getting angry and attacking, I want to calmly correct him… Besides, I became friends with Mom, whom I love so much, so surely, I can become friends with the Dad whom my mom chose too. I should be able to like him. I think so, but…that’s only because I’ve become calm right now. When I actually stand in front of Dad, my emotions will likely change again…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“If I could just accept things as they are, it might be easier. Perhaps it’d be best for me if I could just give up on my Dad… But somewhere deep down, I know that’s not the best for me. Because when the time comes for me to get married, I want to walk down the aisle with my Dad by my side. Even if it’s impossible now, when that time comes, I want him to acknowledge me. I want him to wholeheartedly accept the person I choose to marry— So not being able to give up on my Dad is, how should I put it… maybe a bit tough for me…”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa finished speaking and let out a big sigh.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I could only glance at her profile, lost in my thoughts.</p>

<p>『Hey. Yoda, you’re really a big idiot, aren’t you?』</p>

<p>She was the one to whom I had revealed my embarrassing feelings.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa hugged me and said that…</p>
<p>Even though I wanted to repay her feelings, I couldn’t find the right words to ease her troubles.</p>
<p>No matter how much I turned over the drawers in my mind, I couldn’t find anything.</p>
<p>So, the words that came out of my unreliable mouth were just these,</p>

<p>“Tsumakawa-san, it must be hard for you too…”</p>
<p>“Heh… Don’t think you’re the only one going through hard times, you dummy.”</p>

<p>Ah, that’s not it… That’s not what I meant to say.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to say something like this. Sorry, that’s not it…</p>
<p>I thought that while looking at Tsumakawa, who was pretending to be cheerful while grinning and patting my shoulder.</p>
<p>I’m frustrated. She relied on me, but I couldn’t give her back what she asked for, and that really frustrated me.</p>
<p>Surely, if I were the protagonist of a light novel, things wouldn’t have turned out like this.</p>
<p>If I had even one quality like those characters, perhaps I could’ve provided Tsumakawa with some profound words or taken an action that would’ve comforted her heart…</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m just a gloomy high school student who loves light novels.</p>
<p>I realized that I couldn’t do anything for her and that I’m not skilled enough to do something, especially when someone needs help like she does.</p>
<p>Having thought this far, I inadvertently blurted out some words… Even though I knew that saying this to Tsumakawa-san was off the mark. Nevertheless, I ended up conveying my feelings to her.</p>

<p>“…I’m sorry, Tsumakawa-san. I can’t seem to come up with anything clever to say…”</p>
<p>“Huh, why is Yoda apologizing? You’re the one who had to listen to my complaints. If anything, I should be apologizing. You permitted me to vent, so I won’t apologize! “</p>
<p>“Tsumakawa-san…”</p>
<p>“By the way, Yoda, do you not get what I meant by telling you this? It’s not like I’m asking for a clear answer. It’s not about wanting someone to provide a solution; it’s more about wanting someone to listen to me.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. That’s why — just talking to Yoda like this, there’s a part of me that feels a bit saved. Because you listen to my complaints, which surely aren’t pleasant to hear, with such sincerity, my heart feels just a bit lighter, you know?</p>
<p>“But I haven’t done anything…”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I’m glad I turned to you, Yoda. I’m glad that Yoda was with me on this hard night…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>With those beautiful words, she gathered her spirits and presented me with a smile that seemed forcibly wrung out from within her.</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a distinct sound in my eardrums, as if something had changed.</p>

<p>My light novel friend, Minacho——The class’s cheerful girl, Miona Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>For some reason, she had taken an interest in me, a gloomy, nerdy otaku.</p>
<p>Even though I had protested with ‘I can’t understand three-dimensional girls, they’re scary’ and tried to distance her, Tsumakawa had ignored that and made efforts to be with me.</p>
<p>And now, she was… in my house, not at Horito’s or Kanachamu’s, not at the house of a male friend or a female friend.</p>
<p>It’s none other than the Yoda’s family home——</p>


<p>“I asked Yoda for help, and he helped me out. You get permission from the family, and you said you’ll let me stay… S-Sorry. This whole thing wasn’t my intention… um, I’ll ask Kanachamu next time.”</p>

<p>——Despite having many friends who would answer her call for help…</p>
<p>Not just Horido and Kanachiyamu. Good classmates, club members, gal pals she worked with at the same magazine… Unlike me, who had few friends, she had countless options.</p>
<p>However, on the night when she wanted to rely on someone, she chose to rely on me.</p>
<p>…Have I ever been someone that others depended on despite having so many options?</p>

<p>I’ve been relied on by my older sister. But that’s because we’re family.</p>
<p>I’ve been relied on by male friends. But those were requests like ‘Can you lend me 500 yen?’ that anyone could fulfill; it wasn’t a real favor asked of me.</p>

<p>I probably haven’t experienced someone relying on me like this before.</p>
<p>So, this feeling of guilt that is spreading in my heart now is not a feeling of not meeting Tsumakawa’s expectations——It’s an ambition, embarrassingly strong, to respond and meet her expectations.</p>

<p>With this realization about myself, a clear outline of the place I want to reach has become visible.</p>
<p>I used to think this feeling was presumptuous, so I couldn’t put it into words, but now those unspoken feelings are bubbling up in my chest.</p>
<p>I’m not yet a person who could become Tsumakawa-san’s friend in the truest sense.</p>
<p>——But I want to become someone who could eventually be her friend.</p>
<p>It might not be a dream that someone like me, with my personality, should have.</p>
<p>Yet, despite knowing I can’t meet Tsumakawa-san’s expectations, I still want to strive to be someone who can. Even if I can’t respond to her hopes, I still want to try.</p>

<p>After a moment of silence, I say words that, a little while ago, I would have been too embarrassed to utter,</p>

<p>“While I might not have any answers for the troubles Tsumakawa-san is facing… if talking about your complaints a little can make you feel even a bit better, then I’m more than willing to listen…”</p>
<p>“…Yoda, are you being kind right now? I wonder, if I keep asking, would you maybe sleep with me? Hey, how about we sleep together here?”</p>
<p>“I won’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so… hehe. But seriously, this makes me happy. You’re willing to listen to my rant?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… That’s pretty much all I can do in my current state… Since that’s all I can do, I thought I could at least listen to your story, Tsumakawa-san.”</p>
<p>“…Hey, could I hold your pinky?”</p>
<p>“You can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“You’re too stingy…”</p>

<p>After Tsumakawa said that, she rolled onto the futon and lay down.</p>
<p>In response, I got up once and then sat outside the futon again.</p>
<p>While lying on her back, she asked me to hold out my left hand, saying, ‘Give me your left hand.’</p>
<p>So, I extended my left hand, and she tightly grasped the cuff of my pajama’s left sleeve.</p>
<p>While doing so, with her cheeks reddening from embarrassment, she said,</p>

<p>“Holding the sleeve is okay, right?”</p>
<p>” …Well, yes, indeed… it’s okay, although it’s truly regrettable… “</p>
<p>“Are you a politician?”</p>

<p>After that retort, Tsumakawa smiled happily.</p>
<p>Her smile was still different from the usual smile she showed me—definitely not a forced one—It was a smile that let me realize that Tsumakawa-san had become just a little bit more spirited.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let me complain again, just a little bit…”</p>

<p>***</p>


<p>Time passed, and it’s four hours later.</p>
<p>Wait, four hours!?</p>

<p>“——Anyway, I really admire Kanachamu, you know? Her sense of fashion and nails are off the charts. But if only she could develop a good sense of judging men, she’d be perfect. That’s the only thing that’s lacking in her. …Her recent boyfriend? Super sketchy. Turns out, aside from Kanachamu, he’s been with another girl for eight years! When I asked if that girl was his main girl and Kanachamu was the side chick, she’s like, ‘No, I was totally loved. I was the main one.’ She’s too stubborn in weird ways! Apparently, they broke up because they didn’t share hobbies, but isn’t that something you check at the beginning!? Anyway, lately, Kanachiyamu has been saying things like——’I’m tired of handsome guys, maybe I’ll go for a plain-looking guy next.’ And then she was like, ‘Can you introduce me to someone like Yoda?’ I got super mad and told her I’d never introduce her. Yoda, be careful with strange women, okay?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Hey, Yoda? Are you awake?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, yeah… Yeah, I’m awake…”</p>
<p>“Good. Well then, continuing with the story—”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Are you going to continue this stupid story?</p>
<p>I truly thought that, but I couldn’t put it into words.</p>
<p>…Repeating myself, since my declaration to ‘listen to Tsumakawa-san’s complaints as much as she wants,’ four hours had passed.</p>
<p>The current time was 6:30 in the morning… and I was still being subjected to Tsumakawa-san’s empty chatter.</p>

<p>To be precise, her grumbling about her issues with Tsumakawa Papa ended within the first hour.</p>
<p>Despite that, Tsumakawa-san, without even sleeping, kept droning on with unrelated stories until now… I had intended to listen to her story until she felt satisfied since I couldn’t be of much help to her, but I’m sorry. I’m really starting to feel sleepy!</p>
<p>As I was drowsily tuning out her incessant talk that seemed like the endless chanting of the Heart Sutra, Tsumakawa, rubbing her sleepy eyes, finally said something.</p>

<p>” …In other words, Kanachamu is my best friend… So, well, how do I put this… I want you to meet her someday, Yoda… But Kanachamu is a really attractive girl, so if Yoda falls for her just because she’s an attractive girl… I’d be upset… You know, those kinds of feelings… Ugh, I’m… sleepy… Hey, Yoda… can I sleep…?”</p>
<p>” No need to ask for permission for that…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Okay, I’ll sleep—…zzZ”</p>
<p>“That speed of falling asleep, are you Nobita-kun or something…?”</p>

<p>I said that while pushing my eyelids that were nearly closed due to fatigue and confirmed Tsumakawa’s state.</p>
<p>She was sleeping soundly, like a baby who has been crying.</p>
<p>Oh, she finally fell asleep… I wonder if mothers who put their babies to sleep in the early morning feel like this…</p>
<p>Anyway, even if I didn’t know if she had recovered her energy, I was finally freed from Miona Tsumakawa’s endless talk live session.</p>
<p>I got up from that spot, intending to head back to my room, but then I noticed something.</p>

<p>“Zzz… Zzz…”</p>

<p>As she made adorable sleeping sounds, her right hand was still tightly holding the cuff of my pajama’s sleeve…OMG!</p>
<p>Of course, I could shake off her hand and retreat to my room.</p>
<p>However, I found myself contemplating whether it was okay to remove her hand that was holding my sleeve so tightly.</p>
<p>If Tsumakawa-san woke up and I wasn’t here, what would she think…?</p>

<p>『I’m really sorry. But… can you still stay with me for a bit longer?』</p>
<p>Of course, I had no intention of sleeping next to her.</p>
<p>But since I had once agreed to Tsumakawa-san’s request, even though I felt this way, should I continue staying by her side after she fell asleep like this?</p>
<p>However, that might seem presumptuous since I’m neither Tsumakawa-san’s boyfriend nor even a friend…</p>
<p>While struggling with such thoughts, I gazed at her, who was making sleeping sounds. ‘Mm, Yoda…’ I was suddenly called by my name, making me startle.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa-san, in her uncharacteristically absent expression, continued to sleep as if tormented by a nightmare.</p>

<p>” …Sigh…”</p>

<p>Seeing Tsumakawa-san’s face, I let out a small sigh and then sat back down.</p>
<p>This might also be hypocritical, but… it’s not because I want to be by her side.</p>
<p>Because her hand still held onto my pajama’s cuff, preventing me from returning to my room, I became unable to move.</p>
<p>Eventually, I let out a big yawn and rolled over to the side—right next to her sleeping futon on the tatami.</p>

<p>“…Forgive me. My pride as a stubborn otaku…”</p>

<p>Normally, the otaku code within me wouldn’t allow me to sleep in the same room as Tsumakawa-san. But desperate times call for desperate measures…or something like that…</p>

<p>After 6:30 in the morning and being extremely tired, I patted myself on the back for managing to stay awake up to this point and sprawled out next to Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>Listening to someone speak continuously might be more tiring than I thought…</p>
<p>Four hours earlier, I was tossing and turning in my room, unable to sleep due to the scent of Tsumakawa-san’s perfume.</p>
<p>But now, next to her, I closed my eyes as if I were dead—and without dreaming, I fell into a deep sleep.</p>
