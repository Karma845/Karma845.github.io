<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 12 - A Happy and Embarrassing First Date</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I decided to go out with Yayoi-chan tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was relieved that she had agreed to go out with me, even though I was acting a little pushy, but I rushed home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If this is the first step in making Yayoi-chan blend in with the class, I hope she takes it well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Hm? Going out for fun? On a day off with a girl? No, that’s…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey. Isn’t this what one would call, a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I scowled as if I had faced a very difficult math problem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7">I<span class="calibre8"> quickly opened the Japanese dictionary on my desk and flipped to the “date” page.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘A date is a meeting between a man and a woman at a time and place agreed upon in advance.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew it, I had asked her out on a date!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What does a date consist of though!? You need to put that in the dictionary, not just the meaning!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Where do we go on a date? Does a date mean eating dinner or something? What do I talk about on a date? What is a date??</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was in a panic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The word “date” kept spinning around inside my head, causing my form to collapse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had asked her to go out with me without even giving it a second thought, but this was a major problem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I looked into the mirror, my face was pale. I looked pretty much like I’m dead. I might be able to view the death of a trillion stars anytime now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“S**t… I can’t think of anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My eyes roll back in my head and my blood starts to run cold. My body temperature drops to below zero and I start to feel really sleepy. Don’t sleep! If you do, you’ll die!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I continue to have no plan at all, it will end VERY badly. And so I googled “date ideas for high school students”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s said that theme parks such as amusement parks were recommended for a first date, but we don’t have anything like that in this neighborhood. I had no idea what to expect, </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">so I decided for us to meet at a train station in the city, and that was the end of my luck. I should have done some more research before asking her out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ughh! What am I going to do? I don’t have an idea of what to do on a date!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I dive into the bed and scream out at the top of my lungs by instinct. It was obvious from the way I looked that I couldn’t come up with any particular ideas.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Should I talk to Mayama about it? But he’d probably laugh at me, so let’s not do that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Should I cancel now? No, I don’t know Yayoi-chan’s contact information, and I don’t know how to get in touch with her…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I press my face against the pillow and mumble her name that I couldn’t say to her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Onii-chan, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was rolling around, wriggling about in bed, my sister Sanae peeked into my room to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> “…No, nothing much.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not going to ask my sister how I’m supposed to date someone. I still have some pride as an older brother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Didn’t you say something about a ‘date’?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I would never yell out such a thing. Look, get out of here already!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I waved my hand at Sanae, who was looking at me with suspicion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Onii-chan, you’re going on a date, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, it’s none of your business.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re worried about that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> Sanae stares at me without backing down, is she able to read my mind?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I can tell pretty easily if you have such a pathetic look on your face. Come on, tell me about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae comes into my room and sits down on the cushion as she says that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You …….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On one hand, I wondered why I had to talk to my junior high school sister about dating, but on the other, I also wanted to hang on to her words to see if there was anything she </span><span class="calibre8">could do to help me out. That’s how desperate I am right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“If you don’t want to talk about it, just tell me a story.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She invites me to speak while being calm and composed ‘Come on, talk to me’. What a classy junior high school student, making it so easy for me to talk!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But since I was prepared to invite Yayoi-chan. I couldn’t fail because of my weird pride. Let’s put aside my shame and grab the spider’s thread.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fo-for example. Where should we go on our first date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sitting back on the bed, I was wondering what kind of advice am I asking from my sister?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, I tell myself, this is all for Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well… For example, it’d be nice to have lunch or go shopping, but if the guy’s communication skills are catastrophic, there’ll be the problem of not being able to hold a </span><span class="calibre8">conversation because there’s nothing to talk about. Silence is pretty much h**l when you’re all alone!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae glanced at me and smirked while giving me some appropriate advice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a close call. I didn’t realize that dating and h**l were two sides of the same coin!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…That’s just an example.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You say “an example,” but that boy is totally supposed to be me, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Certainly, if I were to have lunch alone with Yayoi-chan, it’s obvious that we would not be able to continue the conversation for much longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In light of our after-school work the other day, it’s unlikely that Yayoi-chan would be the one to initiate the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This means that I have to take the lead, but I’m not at all confident in my ability to do so. At this rate, it would be game over within the first minute itself. Welcome to h**l!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, for example, what kind of person are you dealing with?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are their hobbies?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Indoorsy? Outdoorsy?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Onii-chan, are you going on a date with an alien by chance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Th-that’s just a myth!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae sighs loudly, and I start to feel dizzy too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know anything about what Yayoi-chan likes, to be honest. On the contrary, all I know is that she thinks I’m cool and that she’s an agent, which is some pretty solid information.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If it just happens to be, we’ll just see Hiroshima Castle and maybe go to Miyajima…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If we go around the various tourist spots, won’t the topics follow us even if we don’t want them to? And there are deer on Miyajima too!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, is that a field trip for elementary school students? Girls don’t expect a kind of date with historical sites and tourist attractions.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae objects to me within just a second. No but, the deer? Aren’t they cute?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yocchan, Fumi-chan, Rei-chan…. There are plenty of candidates for lunch places!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“These aren’t okonomiyaki restaurants! You’re on a date, so this restaurant has to be more fashionable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes! She’ll like sweets! We’re going to visit the Momiji Manjuu factory at…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“In your mind, momiji manjuu is in the category of sweets? And a factory tour is the wrong direction for a date. Rejected!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My date plans are rejected at every turn by Sanae. Isn’t dating too difficult?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Go see a movie already! With a movie, you don’t have to talk for two hours, and you have something to talk about if you discuss your impressions of the movie. For example…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae waved her palm as if to throw a warning to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-I see…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was rather impressed with such a goofy date plan. There is a movie theater nearby. It’s the best location I’d say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Make sure you check the movie timings though. If it’s a top-ranked movie, you can’t go wrong. And have you thought about what you’re going to wear?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae raised her index finger and gave me advice one by one. It’s like having a top-notch dating instructor right in front of you. You can really count on her for help… </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“C-clothes….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked inside my wardrobe, but couldn’t think of anything fashionable to show off to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> I give up, I guess I’ll have to go in uniform if that’s the case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">really </span></i><span class="calibre8">think you’re going to wear a uniform tomorrow, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Scary</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She knows everything about her brother, doesn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t think so. I’m talking about, for example….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think it’s most fashionable to wear what you want to wear without being influenced by trends, but you don’t have too much experience… </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae looks at me with a jealous look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Don’t take my track record into account without my permission! </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m your older brother, remember?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know what she likes, and it’s dangerous to show off my sense of style.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae took the liberty of opening the wardrobe and began rummaging through it with a huff.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not just for example anymore, it’s a concrete strategy, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I only have sneakers and shoes anyway, so I’m going to prioritize cleanliness, so I’m going to wear jeans and this white shirt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae takes the initiative to pull out clothes from my closet and decide on a coordinated outfit for the date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Going on a date with a girl you don’t know very well is like a baby who just learnt to crawl and began driving a big bus. First of all, be safe and stick to the basics. Understand?” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I left everything to Sanae, but she seemed to have settled on a date plan for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The baby will be able to walk by himself now, yes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, I’m going back to my room. I don’t want to stay here forever talking about something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She put her hands on her hips and looked a bit annoyed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Thank you, Sanae.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thank Sanae as she leaves the room. I think she was only half stunned, but it helped out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re talking about my examples, right? A brother’s shame is also a sister’s shame, so get a grip!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae closes the door with a slam.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What a dependable little sister. Now I won’t have to be embarrassed in front of Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Okay, I’ll definitely make tomorrow’s date a huge success so that Yayoi-chan can see me smile!</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The next day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put on the outfit that Sanae had decided for me, checked the movie times, and chose about five restaurants for lunch that were not okonomiyaki restaurants on the Internet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We were supposed to meet at 11:00 a.m., but I arrived at Hondori Station at 9:00 a.m. I didn’t want to be late.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I arrived too early, not wanting to be late. I am not being fickle, I’m just very cautious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have some time, so while I’m at it, I’ll review the topics of conversation I thought about last night. School life, dogs, and sweets…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The topics I had prepared were surprisingly few. One of the topics was about the same as the one I had prepared for last night.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It highlights the fact that I don’t know anything about Yayoi-chan, and I’m afraid she won’t like it if I ask her this or that…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">First of all, would she really come in the first place? I was a little too aggressive in inviting her after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was feeling a little uneasy, the train seemed to have just arrived and many people came out of the ticket gate. There was still quite a bit of time before the meeting time, </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">and I tried to move out of the way of the wave of people, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fu-Fukase-kun!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard a voice calling out to me and I turned around to look at the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was a girl in a white blouse and blue skirt standing there, looking at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For a moment, I didn’t know who she was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t have mistaken her for anyone at school, because she was way beyond my imagination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t even blink my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The girl who was approaching me with a fluttering little run was Yayoi-chan.</span></p>

img

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m a bit surprised to see Yayoi-chan show up after having arranged to meet up with her. I checked my watch again. It was still just past nine o’clock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, aren’t you a little too early?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I didn’t want to be late…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan bites her pink lips and turns away with a flush.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her face was already quite red, but she didn’t look at me as if she was embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I didn’t notice you at first because you’re not in uniform.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Do I look weird…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan wraps her hands tightly around her body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not weird at all! It looks good on you! I love it! It’s great!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I lack the vocabulary and experience to compliment a girl’s casual wear, so I exaggerate a bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan is a stylish girl, so it’s no surprise that she looks good no matter what she wears, but that blue skirt emphasizes the freshness of spring and makes her look even </span><span class="calibre8">more glamorous than usual. To be honest, I didn’t think she was this stylish. I was about to wear my school uniform. That was a close call.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, what shall we do now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was unexpected for us to get together so early, and I was immediately in a bit of trouble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had planned to go see a movie, but there was still quite a bit of time before the screening. What should we do until then…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Despite this predicament, Yayoi-chan was as expressionless as ever and didn’t seem to be interested in conversation. The only thing different from usual was her attire, and her a</span><span class="calibre8">ttitude was as salty as it was at school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is h**l arriving already?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, I have to be firm here. I’m the one who asked her out, and this date is meaningless unless I can get Yayoi-chan to open up to me, even if it’s just a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Don’t be negative, don’t run away, don’t give up!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“In the meantime, let’s go somewhere else, shall we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan nodded her head silently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We walked out of the station and headed to the ground level. The morning air felt a little cooler.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The street was deserted as we entered the main street arcade. As I started walking aimlessly, Yayoi-chan followed me at a slight distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced at her and she noticed and looked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She doesn’t make eye contact with me any more than usual. I wonder what’s wrong?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe it’s because I forcefully asked her out, but even though she came on a date with me, she didn’t look like she was having fun at all. It was like she was going out with me because she had no choice, and it made me feel awkward too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The many plans I had made since last night fell through from the start, and I just kept walking through the arcade in silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think about going into a store somewhere, but it is still 9:00 in the morning and not many stores are open at this time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Finally, I walk through the arcade from one end to the other and stop without anything happening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are we going to do now? I was planning to watch a movie or something, but there’s still some time left…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I ask Yayoi-chan, worrying myself into a state of self-pity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is there anywhere you want to go?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, Yayoi-chan was in a fidgety state as she was asked to decide where she wanted to go.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The meet-up was fine, but the rest of the trip was a complete disaster. It’s my inability to deal with unexpected events. My lack of dating experience had been completely </span><span class="calibre8">exposed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The silent time that followed felt like an eternity, and the words “failure” began to appear in my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was too young to go on a date with someone I could barely converse with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is just like playing the piano. I was just spinning my wheels again, feeling good about myself. I was just satisfied with asking Yayoi-chan out without thinking about the </span><span class="calibre8">other person, wasn’t I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry, I suddenly asked you out of the blue, it was a dumb move.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Filled with regret, I apologize.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure my face looked miserable and depressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan just phases it out, too. It’s not enough to get her to open up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At the exit of the arcade, we both have an awkward air of uncertainty about each other, and here we finally make eye contact for a brief moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Our expressions were clouded as we momentarily crossed paths, and I’m sure we didn’t look very much like a man and woman on a date to those around us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">” Should we go home for the rest of the day?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was afraid that the silence would only continue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I was prepared to open Yayoi-chan’s heart, but this is nothing like a date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I failed again…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I stepped out to go back the way I came.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She grabbed my arm tightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ve never done anything like this before, so I don’t know what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan closed her eyes and put her hand between them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought she was crying, but she wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Not yet, I don’t want to go home yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan quickly raised her head and looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The expression on her face was indescribable, and for a moment I struggled to understand it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her eyebrows are unbalanced, and the corners of her mouth are twitching. Her eyes, always large as ever, were swollen and half open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a very badly made forced smile, it’s as if she had failed at a smiling contest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What’s wrong, Yayoi-chan?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stared at that awkward smile, thinking that I had to react in some way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is this the part where I smile? No, is this a smile in the first place…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was mesmerized by Yayoi-chan’s unusual expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wh-what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The actual Yayoi-chan seemed to be troubled, not understanding the reason for my sudden freeze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry, I just got caught up in Kinoshita-san’s smile…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I intended to express my feelings indirectly, it turned out to be a very straight-forward response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s face turned bright red in response to my careless statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“C-caught up…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s not that I’m mesmerized, it’s more like, you finally smiled at me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Let’s just say I stared at Yayoi-chan as she covered her face with her hands and was boiling red, her smiles gone now!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not. I may have been glaring at Fukase-kun all this time, but it wasn’t on purpose, it was a misunderstanding…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi suddenly began to make excuses while flapping her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The expression you forced yourself to make to avoid glaring at me, was it a smile? Was she trying to make me feel better for suddenly asking her to leave?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, as an agent, is it a problem in business if she is fatally inept at making up a smile?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-I don’t care! It’s my fault for being so familiar with you at school. Besides, it was a misunderstanding…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What was?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The same thing that had happened to Mayama sometime ago, the suicide bombing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sure you’ve heard of this before, but Mayama’s an idiot…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t care about that. You’re the one who was staring at me at that time…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, no, I wasn’t staring at you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In fact, it was a long glare. …… I can’t say that It was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…… so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seemed that Yayoi-chan wanted to clear up our past misunderstandings as well, and we lightly exchanged glances, as if relieved with each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Finally, Yayoi’s expression softened as her lame smile and the wrinkles between her eyebrows disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At this moment, the delicate and awkward atmosphere seemed to fizzle out and the tension between us seemed to ease.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was trying to do it right this morning, too, but I couldn’t… speak well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s the same for me too. I got really nervous. I hope you didn’t mind that I asked you out so suddenly…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s not like I didn’t like it. I was just surprised.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With the mutual misunderstanding cleared up, we finally looked at each other, face to face properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan seems to be acting very carefully so as to not glare at me, but she can’t seem to stop her face from turning red. Gradually, as usual, her face turns reddish, starting from her cheeks and ending at her ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We stopped in the middle of the road with nowhere to go, but I felt like I could move forward a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I actually have a place I’d like to go…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan said, holding the hem of her skirt as if she had made up her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was a bit unprepared, but Yayoi-chan’s suggestion was a godsend and I decided to jump on board with it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is that so? Then let’s go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After an unexpected two-hour meeting and an awkward, silent march, our date starts to take a turn for the better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“This way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan invites me over, though I still don’t feel completely at ease with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">To Yayoi-chan’s left side, I stand. We start walking side by side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s a holiday in town, the weather is nice, and the blue and white marbled sky is a sight to behold. I finally have time to look up at the sky, and my mind starts to clear up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The weather is nice, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It sure is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wondered if it was ever possible for us to have such a casual conversation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I first met her at the café at the school festival, she would have ignored me, sneered at me, and stared at me like a devil when I tried to talk to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The thought of having a date with Yayoi-chan suddenly makes my head light up, and as usual, my fantasy continues to accelerate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi-chan, shall we hold hands?”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">“Eh, it’s embarrassing, Satsuki-kun.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">“I’m worried that you might run away from me.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">“Aha, I’m a fugitive of love.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">“My hands are the handcuffs of love that will never be release–!”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not sure if she noticed my heart rate accelerating due to my excessive paranoia, but Yayoi-chan had noticed something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-it’s nothing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No more, I cut off my delusion with abstinence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You can go back to your delusions later, you idiot!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“S-so where are we going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’ll have to wait until we get there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looks a bit embarrassed and walks a little faster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t pry any further and followed Yayoi-chan quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t afford to put a damper on the date that had just gotten off to a good start now, could I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m literally on the exact definition of a date right now!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We continue on to a large street where a streetcar passes by. I’d like to go to Miyajima next time. Deer are pretty cute.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If there’s another date, I’ll have to plan it out so it doesn’t get awkward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was already thinking about our next date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard a voice behind me, and Yayoi-chan, who was walking in front of me, stopped dead in her tracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I reflexively turned around to see a man in a suit standing there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wondered if he was an acquaintance of hers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Father?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked at the man and let out a nervous voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Father?</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at Yayoi-chan and the man alternatively. The cheerful mood I had been in earlier turned into a panic immediately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This man is Yayoi-chan’s father…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He spoke in a low tone, and Yayoi-chan stood erect and froze, clutching her blue skirt tightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her father was dressed in an expensive-looking suit, his black-rimmed glasses giving him a strict look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He’s an agent, too, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“And you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time, a sharp look came at me, and I felt fear as if I had been shot through the heart. I had been glared at by Yayoi-chan many times before, but this was not something as simple as that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Let’s just say, it’s more of a killing intent directed at a man who’s with his daughter. I was convinced by his eyes alone that he was a skilled agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I, um, I’m Kinoshita-san’s classmate and my name is Satsuki Fukase…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I introduce myself honestly, as if I had been drugged with a truth serum.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…I see. I’m sure my daughter is in good hands.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, the killing intent disappeared at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Squinting through his glasses, he turned to me, a classmate of his daughter, with the eyes of a kind father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s my pleasure…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hurriedly bowed my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I never thought I would run into Yayoi-chan’s father… and that’s while on a date with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was greeting her father, Yayoi-chan didn’t move an inch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It would be awkward to run into your parents while on a date, but Yayoi-chan’s expression was beyond that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Are you scared of your father?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is she afraid of him because he’s forcing her to work as an agent?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I imagined their family relationship and glanced at her father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, I have to go to work now. Sorry for interrupting you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He turned his head away from me and raised his glasses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Take care of Yayoi, will you, Fukase-kun? “</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In a low but sharp voice, he held out his left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, yes…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew, of course, what would happen if I shook his hand. But I could not refuse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I fearfully shook his hand with my own.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">This is the first time I’ve seen Yayoi smile in a long time. I still want Yayoi to live her life as a normal girl rather than as an agent.</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What I heard from her father was not hostility toward me for dating his daughter, nor was it a warning as an agent, but it was the voice of a gentle father hoping for his daughter’s happiness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“N-nice to meet you…”</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I bowed my head once more, feeling a thick hand grasping mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even though I was already scared to death when I met Yayoi-chan’s father, now that I heard his voice in my mind. I was beyond confused and my head was spinning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He was not forcing his daughter to work as an agent, but rather it was the complete opposite.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her father doesn’t want Yayoi-chan to be an agent…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, I’ll take my leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He left without sounding a single footstep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The back of his figure looked somewhat lonely and didn’t look like the back of an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After her father left, Yayoi-chan remained standing there in a daze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry, I didn’t expect to see my father here…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Covering her face with her hands, Yayoi-chan apologized in a weak voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, there’s nothing to apologize for…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t know what to say to her after hearing her father’s true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s Yayoi-chan, who doesn’t </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">want </span></i><span class="calibre8">to be an agent, and her father, who </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">doesn’t</span></i><span class="calibre8"> want her to be an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The two seem to have the same interests, but where’s the discrepancy?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who remained depressed in the middle of the street, was clearly losing her temper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A sudden encounter with her father cast a dark cloud over our date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This can’t go on like this!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Things were finally starting to work out too! </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I look down at this point, I’ll never see the real Yayoi-chan again!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, let’s go! You have someplace you want to go, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to shake off the bad vibe by acting all cheery and cheerful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re taking me there, right? I’m counting on you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I showed her my smile to cheer her up, who still had a somber expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan lifted her head at this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hm? Let’s go then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Yes. This way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan nodded her head broadly, as if to lift her spirits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She seemed to be a bit depressed after meeting her father, but I’m relieved to see that she seems to have regained her energy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is a date to help break down the walls in Yayoi-chan’s mind, so she can’t be bothered with them any longer. Today I have to forget about all the stuff about agents and </span><span class="calibre8">make the date a success!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I silently follow Yayoi-chan as she heads off to her destination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was wondering if she had a restaurant she wanted to go to, Yayoi-chan started walking down the stairs to an underground shopping mall called Paleo.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Actually, the first time I met Fukase-kun wasn’t when we were at the café at that festival.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we walked down the stairs with a thump, Yayoi-chan spoke up as if she had been waiting for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was unable to read what she was going to say next, so I just nodded my head in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, Yayoi’s next words changed the situation abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I saw Fukase-kun playing the piano in the gymnasium that morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was going down the stairs when my feet stopped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Weren’t you tending to the cafe all morning that day…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan turns around and looks up at me as I stop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“S-so that’s it…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan tells me the truth, and the fragments of memories that I had been covering up in my head begin to overflow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The past is an event that I don’t want to be mentioned ever again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the piano performance at the school festival concert that went horribly wrong.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Did Yayoi-chan see that?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong? Are you feeling okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, no, I’m fine. It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Obviously, my heartbeat was rising, but I tried to keep my composure so that Yayoi-chan wouldn’t notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I get agitated at this point, the date will definitely be ruined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s nothing wrong with being seen. Everyone in the class, even Mayama, had seen me fail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Wondering why Yayoi suddenly said such a thing, I went down the stairs and noticed it as I entered the paleo underground mall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It reminded me of something Sanae said to me one day..</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Did you know there’s now a street piano in the basement of Paleo?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">─ ─ No way?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan had no hesitation in heading toward the place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ve always wanted to hear Fukase-kun play the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Arriving at the expected place, Yayoi-chan turned around with an excited look on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was a street piano with a white body and a colorful flower design. I was stunned to see that gorgeous piano in front of me for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was very moved by Satsuki-kun’s performance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought she was joking, but Yayoi-chan was serious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That time, I messed up, you know? I ruined the concert, didn’t I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How could you be impressed by such a horrible performance…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I froze and was pulled in front of the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wait a minute, Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t resist, so I was made to sit in the chair in a helpless state.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Things were going so fast that I still wasn’t able to get my head around it at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You were playing Donaudi’s song at that time, right? I was curious, so I looked it up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Wasn’t it a coincidence that you picked up a Donaudi CD at the Power Recorder the other day?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seems like Yayoi-chan had seen all my mistakes. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I heard he plays the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s incredible.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Let’s go listen to him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The plaza where this piano was set up had just become a meeting place, and people began to gather when they noticed that I was sitting in front of the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The buzz of the crowd brought back memories of the events at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wish you would play the song you were playing then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked at me with innocent eyes as if she was anticipating me to do so, but I was hesitant to touch the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had not played the piano once since that festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I froze, and a concerned voice called out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was in a rush, remembering my failure, but it was nothing compared to that tense situation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I just took a little break from the piano. I haven’t played for six months, but that doesn’t mean I can’t play anymore. I’ll just play a few bars quickly and show her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan is doing her best to make today’s date go well. She made herself smile so she wouldn’t glare at me. I know it must have been awkward for her to see her father, but </span><span class="calibre8">she told me what she wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I promised you earlier that I would make the date a success, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Okay, I’ll play it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at the keyboard from left to right, and finally found the middle “Do” and put my right thumb on it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The piano felt cold and distant after six months of contact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I let out a big breath and tried to play.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">–Huh?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My fingers wouldn’t move.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">–Why?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mind went completely dark.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">–What’s going on?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My hands are shaking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">─ ─ You’re kidding me, right ……?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t play the piano?</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hah”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard that sigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The sigh of regret that lingered in my mind, traumatized and bound to my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I could no longer play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry, I just can’t remember the sheet music.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I apologized to Yayoi-chan, forcing a smile and trying to eat it up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan lowered her eyebrows apologetically, but did not hide her disappointed expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I shoved my trembling hands into my pockets so that they wouldn’t be seen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I haven’t been playing lately. So I forget how to play so easily.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan was looking forward to it, yet I lied and cheated her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The moment I touched the piano, my fear returned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What if I fail again? She would laugh at me. She would be disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Such fear made it impossible for me to play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s fine, it’s fine! It’s my fault for asking you to do something like that out of the blue!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan waved her hands dejectedly, seemingly believing my lie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When they realized I wasn’t going to play the piano, the people around me began to scatter as if they were out of patience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I manage to catch my breath and try to shake off the unpleasant images in my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Why is this happening to me? I can’t believe I froze in front of the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sorry…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan apologized once again. There was no longer any atmosphere of a date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was still reeling from the shock of not being able to play the piano, and Yayoi-chan was remembering how seeing her father had brought her back to reality, and we both </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">seemed to be thinking about different things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Shall we go home for today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And so our first date came to an end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It turned out to be just a date taking place in the morning, with a sweet and sour aftertaste.</span></p>
