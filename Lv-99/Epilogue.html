<h2>Epilogue</h2>


<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, Mom’s home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I returned back home, in an unusual situation, I saw my mother wearing an apron and preparing dinner. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She’s the one in charge of the Kinoshita family’s agent business, and she’s always out on business meetings. She was away on a business trip for a few days the other day, and usually comes home late at night, so it was rare for her to be home before I was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Welcome home. You’re early”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Can I help?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without changing out of my uniform, I threw my bag out in the living room, put on my apron, and went into the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I loved my mother. She was a good cook, tall and stylish, and always put us first. She never forced us to work as agents, my dad doesn’t either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you. Then, can you bring out the plates?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom’s back figure was beautiful today as she sliced the vegetables in a rhythmic motion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her waist was tightened by her apron, and she looks very stylish. I always wish I were as tall as my mother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where’s dad today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I rolled up my uniform and opened the cupboard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“He’s away on a business trip until tomorrow. So today is for the three of us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Copy that!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He’s been away on an agent’s job for quite a while now. He seems to be a shrewd businessman, but I don’t know where he is right now. In this business, secrecy always comes first. I don’t ask for details either. It’s a tacit understanding in the Kinoshita family.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“How’s school? Are you having fun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced back at my mother and saw a small earring shining in her ear through her hair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember when I wanted to get my ears pierced in junior high school, she got mad at me. I like such a strict mother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s fun! Next week we’re going on a field trip to Onomichi! I told you to make me lunch, remember?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I remember. I’ll fill it with all your favorite things.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She smiled happily at me, and I was happy to hear that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was worried about whether or not I would be able to make friends, but once I started going to school, things were going well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried out for the brass band and the older students were nice to me, and I found a stylish café on my way home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">High school life is short, and it would be a loss if I don’t do what I want to do, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“By the way, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I put the ingredients into the pot and turned on the heat, my mother put her hands on her hips and turned towards me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her voice was a little bouncy, and I had a bad feeling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is she going to ask me to do a new job again, or is she going to…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s about Satsuki-senpai, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mom smiles at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I laugh along with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you think, Uzuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She calls my name and asks me what I know about Satsuki-senpai.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I guess my mom is concerned about it too. She can’t ask my sister directly about it, can she?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong…? Aren’t you and your sister getting along well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sis was in her second year and seemed to be enjoying every day a bit more than before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had noticed that she was prioritizing her work as an agent and was trying not to make any friends at school. It became even more pronounced when I got to high school and had to work as the vice principal’s supervisor. It’s like a clumsy big sister sacrificing herself so as to not make her private life meddle with her work life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But after being in the same class as Satsuki-senpai, her hidden feelings gradually came out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Big Sis was trying to keep Satsuki-senpai away from her. But just because she’s an agent doesn’t mean she has to give up on love too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My sister’s feelings were obvious and I decided to support her. I guess you could call it an assisting love, right? Because I want you to do what you want to do. And, of course, love someone too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My sister is shy, but she has recently become more honest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m grateful to Satsuki-senpai for helping me find my real big sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ve never met him, but I’m kind of curious about him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom put her hand on her chin and thought about something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure you’d be concerned if your daughter was getting along with boys too, wouldn’t you? I wonder if she would be worried if I got a boyfriend, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I can see you and your sister are getting along well. You’re so naive that it makes me nervous to watch you grow up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s true, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The distance between the two of them was so awkward that it makes me feel uncomfortable even when I look at it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-senpai also looks a bit awkward, but he’s also blunt in a weird way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t have to worry about it, okay? Satsuki-senpai is not a bad person.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, that’s not what I meant. I can tell when I see Yayoi looking so happy that he’s not a bad kid. I’m not doubting you. You know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The way she said it, including something, reminded me of my discomfort with Satsuki-senpai too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But, I’m kind of doubtful about Satsuki-kun…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Doubtful? Do you think he’s suspicious?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t have any proof, but something in my head seemed to click together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was the first day we met. I was working with my sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There is a reason why I held Satsuki-senpai’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When a person has a secret, he or she unconsciously tries to hide it. It was both my intuition as an agent and my experience that made me feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-senpai usually keeps his left hand in his pocket all the time and always stands on the left side when he is with me or my sister. He keeps his left hand away from us at all times…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My sister probably doesn’t notice it because she’s floating around when she’s with him, but I’ve been noticing it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not a bad feeling, it’s more like an occupational hazard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m using an obnoxious tone, but mom used to be an astute agent too. There must be a good reason for her to suspect Satsuki-senpai. Mom’s intuition is exceptional, even in </span><span class="calibre8">the Kinoshita family.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki, can you do me a favor?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom’s face turned serious, much like my sister’s at school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the face of an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I listened to her without joking around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Would you do some research on Satsuki-kun?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is that request as an agent or as a mother?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t think Satsuki-senpai is a bad person, but I feel suspicious when my mother tells me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Yeah. I understand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt bad for Satsuki-senpai and my sister, but I couldn’t suppress my curiosity either, so I quietly shook my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to explore Satsuki-senpai’s secret, but this is for her sake too, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I also found myself a little bit jealous of my big sister.</span></p>
