<h1 class="calibre3">4 - Chapter 4 - The Distance Between Me and Her</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I returned home and stared at the coffee maker whirring away in the kitchen, I thought back to the events of that lunch break.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san always stays alone, it must be because she’s actually an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reason she was able to smoothly leave the classroom today without anyone suspecting anything is because she always tries to do everything by herself. And she didn’t bother to care about enjoying her after-lunch dessert, which shows her high level of professionalism in the act.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But is there such a thing as having a part-time job as an agent? Who would ask her to do something like this? Isn’t it dangerous?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s so unrealistic that it raises endless questions in my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Agent, Yayoi Kinoshita…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I poured the finished coffee into my cup, I mumbled her name in a low voice, a name I would never say in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Wow, Sanae! Ouch!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Coffee spilled on my fingers as Sanae suddenly appeared in the kitchen wearing her uniform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You spilled coffee all over your fingers. Did you do something stupid?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I didn’t!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I deny it in a second, wiping the spilled coffee with a rag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was worrying about Kinoshita-san, it seems like she came back from junior high school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Big bro, it’s so easy to understand you. Something is bothering you, isn’t it? You’ve been mumbling and acting weird for quite a while now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae, with a grin and a silly smile on her face, is attempting to meddle with my affairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not going to bother you though. It’s none of my business after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It is beyond even Sanae’s imagination that her brother is actually worried about an ‘agent ‘ in the same class as him, let alone a friend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m busy with piano practice, so I’ll be going. I have to practice for the new No Bra song that’s coming out next week!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Sanae fluttered her hands and went back to her room. By the way, “No Bra” is an abbreviation for Sanae’s favorite band, Northern Brand. (TLN: That’s a…. Nice way to abbreviate </span><span class="calibre8">it) (EDN: That’s certainly one way to do so…) (TLN: No Bra for life baby!!)</span> <span class="calibre8">“What the h**l, ugh…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As Sanae had pointed out, it was true that I was a bit troubled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If Kinoshita-san is an agent, there’s nothing I can do about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What in the world am I expecting to do? What even </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is </span></i><span class="calibre8">troubling me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I closed my eyes and asked myself the same question repeatedly in my head, but all I could see behind my eyelids was Kinoshita-san’s scary face glaring at me.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A few more days had passed since I had witnessed Kinoshita-san’s suspicious behavior.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The misunderstanding that I had used Mayama to mess with Kinoshita-san has yet to be fully cleared up. He really went the extra mile, didn’t he!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In my second year of high school life, it seems like my relationship’s are bound to have a lot of incidents. Kinoshita-san and I are currently in a state of a communication </span><span class="calibre8">stalemate, and my heart feels like a banged up convoluted fracture</span> <span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san was becoming even more isolated than ever, perhaps it’s due to her decision to ignore Mayama’s greeting. She doesn’t seem to be sad about it, but I don’t really </span><span class="calibre8">know how she really feels about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even if it is right for her to be alone as an agent, doesn’t Kinoshita-san want to have this normal kind of high school life? Does she plan to stay all alone all the way upto </span><span class="calibre8">graduation?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Many things are on my mind, but there is no way I can ask her about it directly, much less use psychometry for something like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">One day, when I was just agonizingly lamenting the distance between me and Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I need someone’s help with something after school today. Anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In a short homeroom at the end of the day, the homeroom teacher, Shinoda-sensei, suddenly started asking for volunteers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I need you to put together materials for my Japanese class.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shinoda-sensei is a handsome Japanese teacher who’s not yet 30 years old and is rather popular among the girls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, no one took the initiative to help him with his chores after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“If it’s Japanese materials, why don’t the library committee members do it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When no one came forward and a stalemate ensued, someone made a wild suggestion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stopped what I was doing to get ready to leave because I was a member of the library committee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, that’s right. Then I’ll ask Fukase to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As if it was already decided, Shinoda-sensei nominated me, who’s a member of the library committee to help him out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t say no to this now. If I go home too early, Sanae will just be bitter with me again, and it’s not a bad way to make up for being scolded at the opening ceremony now, is it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It might be too much work for one person, so Kinoshita-san, who’s on day duty, can help him out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hahhhhh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shinoda-sensei’s words cause me to overreact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">To my surprise, Kinoshita-san was on day duty today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After a short pause, Kinoshita-san gives a small reply, “Yes.” As expected of a homeroom teacher, I guess she can’t just ignore him like all the others.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Unexpectedly, I got a chance to be alone with Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Wait a minute. Isn’t this a chance to clear up the misunderstanding?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, that’s it for today. The two people I just mentioned, come to the Japanese Language Preparation Room later.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A rattling sound of chairs being pulled over rang out, and we were plunged into the after-school duration of the day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I fearfully walk up to her desk, though I haven’t even done anything yet, and I have no idea about what’s going to happen ahead of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, Ki…….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just as I was about to call out to her, Kinoshita-san silently got up and walked out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, wait!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I followed behind Kinoshita-san with a pathetic look on my face as I fretted about.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Here. Put them together, one at a time, and staple them together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the Japanese Language Preparation Room on the third floor, Shinoda-sensei handed me a large quantity of printouts. I received dozens of prints, which were stacked </span><span class="calibre8">alternatively, with both my hands. The prints were still slightly warm, as if they had just been photocopied, and smelled of ink.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The classroom next door is open. Here, use the stapler.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san took the stapler from the teacher and the two of us went into the nearby classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not sure I want to have this kind of work forced upon me out of the blue!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I spoke to Kinoshita-san to see if she was in a good mood as I laid out the printouts on the desk in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…I guess so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san replied in a hushed voice, refilling the staple lead without looking at me at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, that’s right!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time she didn’t ignore me, and I patted myself on the chest just because she had responded back to me, albeit she might have done that in a slightly salty manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel a great sense of accomplishment, it’s as if I have finally communicated with an alien. What a low goal to set for my life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I would like to take advantage of this momentum to clear up the misunderstanding of the other day, but I decided to start working on it right away instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Okay, then, I’ll collect the prints one at a time, and you can staple them together, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Got it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After saying this, Kinoshita-san moved away from me and took a seat in the back of the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seems that a rather powerful ‘Don’t get too close to me’ aura had been developed. This distance… does she really want to be that far away from me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um… why don’t you come a little closer?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I collect the printouts at the front of the classroom and deliver them all the way to the back where Kinoshita-san is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I’m fine here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san fastens the staple on the left shoulder of the print.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, it’s not okay or anything, you’re acting like a pain in the a*s, you know?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Where did the Kinoshita-san, who was so happy to be in the same class as me go to?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wish she would at least smile affectionately at me. I’d like to see Kinoshita-san smile at least once in my life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Didn’t you have any after-school plans today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In an attempt to somehow ease the atmosphere, I throw out a question as I continue to do my work. It was also a perfect opportunity to find out more about Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Nothing special”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Whack!</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t do club activities, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Whack!</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Cram school and stuff?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Mhm”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Whack!.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What about a part-time job?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Whack!</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Eventually she just began ignoring me, and only the sound of a strong stapler could be heard echoing in an unintended way. And instead of having smiles directed at me, the </span><span class="calibre8">only thing directed at me would be her glares. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No more of this! I put on the brakes, thinking I had overstepped a bit. I don’t want to have another accident after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Knowing Kinoshita-san’s secret, it’s difficult for me to adjust how I communicate with her. After all, the other party is an agent, a professional when it comes to </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">NOT</span></i><span class="calibre8"> being suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, I know due to psychometrically that she thinks I’m cool, but in reality, I don’t know who she really is. I can’t afford to miss the chance to get closer to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">From then on, we continued working in silence, and the atmosphere was no longer conducive to getting to know Kinoshita-san any further or clearing up any </span><span class="calibre8">misunderstandings we had prior.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the awkward atmosphere, the work was almost finished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, I felt a gaze staring from the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before I knew it, a girl was standing outside the window.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She had her hands on the window and was staring at Kinoshita-san.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Was she a friend of Kinoshita-san’s? No, of course not. I don’t think she has any friends.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I called out to her to check up on her, she looked up as she tended to her prints.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Out that window…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as I started to say that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Aah! I knew it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The window rattled open and a loud voice came rushing in from the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hya!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san, who had not noticed the girl’s presence at all, let out a strange voice and turned toward the window.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The mysterious girl shouted through the window at Kinoshita-san</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">─ ─ Onee-chan?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“U-Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san continues, raising both eyebrows and shouting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">─ ─ Uzuki?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The suddenness of the event made me panic, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I looked at the two girls alternatively with a big question mark over my head, the girl came into the classroom in a stride.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Judging by the color of the ribbon on her uniform, she looked like a first-year student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is this girl Kinoshita-san’s… younger sister?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“H-Hi…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I bowed lightly as a classmate, but the girl walked right past me and went straight to Kinoshita-san. I was splendidly passed-by.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey sis, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Apparently, this girl really is Kinoshita-san’s younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She’s much shorter than Kinoshita-san and she also has short-cut brown hair. They are sisters who look quite the opposite from another.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are you doing here? I was on day duty.”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san lifts up a printout to make her point.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Classwork? Sis? You turned down all that stuff in junior high, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t think so! I would at least do my classwork normally!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As Kinoshita-san denies it with a blush on her cheeks, her sister glances at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> “…Who is this person?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ughh, he’s my classmate. I can’t help it because my teacher asked me to do this with him!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I</span><span class="calibre8"> sent her an affectionate smile as a classmate, and her sister smiled back at me. A completely different response from Kinoshita-san!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“How unusual is that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, the younger sister was looking at me and nodding her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But more importantly, Uzuki, you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, shut up for a second!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She interrupted Kinoshita-san and came straight to me this time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, um…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hi, I’m Uzuki, Yayoi Kinoshita’s sister!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She introduced herself again with her hands folded behind her waist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“U-Uzuki…-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Nice to meet you!”</span></p>

img

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She flops her short, slightly brown bobbed head down and gives a quick wink at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The way she smiled with her small dimples on her cheeks was unlike Kinoshita-san’s tension-filled face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yo, nice to meet you… Uzuki, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I responded while rolling my head backwards, and then Uzuki-chan was staring at me from my toes to the top of my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I see, I see. You’re a sucker for faces, aren’t you, big sis?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san’s scream-like rage echoes through the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced over at Kinoshita-san and saw that she had forgotten to glare at me and was frozen in place with a red face instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re joking. Right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She laughs teasingly at her sister and asks her to agree with her. How much of this is a joke now?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was just blown away by the gap between this girl and Kinoshita-san</span> <span class="calibre8">Uzuki Kinoshita.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This little girl who suddenly burst into the room really was Kinoshita-san’s younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Our work came to a halt with the intrusion of Kinoshita-san’s sister, and the three of us were sitting on the chairs in the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, Uzuki-chan was sitting right next to me, smiling, while Kinoshita-san was far away with her elbow on the desk, looking a bit irritated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was obvious that Kinoshita-san’s usually calm pace had been shifting ever since Uzuki’s arrival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, what kind of relationship are you two in?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We’re just classmates!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san immediately assures her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seems I’ve been able to move up the ranks from “Mob-kun” to “Classmate”. I’m so happy!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s your name?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki looks up at me with a twinkle in her eye, as if she’s curious about something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“My name is Satsuki Fukase. Kinoshita-san and I are classmates…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wow, our names, a fellow old calendar!” (TLN: This is what she’s referring to </span><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/can-you-tell-me-the-old-names-of-the-months-2027868" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre3"><span class="calibre8">https://www.thoughtco.com/can-you-tell-me-the-old-names-of-the-months-2027868)</span></a></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi, Uzuki, and then Satsuki, we were pointing at each other in turn, both our smiles bursting with happiness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘This is what I call fate, isn’t it! Don’t you think so too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, that’s right…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Because, sis! It’s fate! Destiny!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She happily reported back to her sister, but Kinoshita-san just turned her head away with a pout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then I’ll call you Satsuki-senpai! You can call me Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was left overwhelmed by Uzuki’s machine gun-like manner of speech. My palms were sweating, a different kind of tension from when I was talking to Kinoshita-san</span> <span class="calibre8">“By the way, Satsuki-senpai. What do you think of my sister?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki! You shut up for a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a bang, the stapler hit the desk and fell to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was no longer a situation of clearing up a misunderstanding or anything like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She couldn’t take a joke from a while ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t you dare say that, even as a joke!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan’s cheeks were puffed out, and Kinoshita-san was clenching her teeth and looking like her head was about to erupt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What am I supposed to do when I’m sandwiched between these two? Should I just smile and nod?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’ve only just enrolled in the school, so why don’t you just go back home?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t care about that, Oh, I’ll ask Satsuki-senpai to show me around the school.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course not! We’re busy, so get out now!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, Kinoshita-san. You don’t have to say that much to her…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, shut up!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even she got pissed off and hunched over and shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san and Uzuki-chan seem to have completely polar-opposite types of personalities, but if you look closely, you can see the similarities in their eyes. The younger sister </span><span class="calibre8">is, of course, also just as beautiful. She is more on the cute side though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, she has an aggressiveness that her sister does not have at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel like if you add their personalities and divide it by two, it would be just the right combination…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, what were you two doing together?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Taking one of the printouts lined up on the desk, Uzuki-chan looks into my face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She is not at all discouraged by her sister’s anger. This boldness and communicative ability of hers is commendable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki, we are busy. You go home early!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san perks up her shoulders and points at the door in my place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was a little glad to hear her say “We”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You didn’t tell my sister off! Hey, Satsuki-senpai?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, well…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I gave a half-smile in response, I was immediately met with a piercing glare from Kinoshita-san. Why am I being glared at?!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am caught between both the Kinoshita sisters, and my emotions are swinging left and right at high speed like a metronome.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I slowly turn my back to Uzuki-chan, feeling very uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The teacher asked me to do some work for him. You’re in my way, so get the h**l out of here. Okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san says in a slow, mature tone that it feels as if you’re forced to listen to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh, that’s boring! I have more questions I want to ask Satsuki-senpai. Right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki, on the other hand, is childishly pouting and asking me for help. She has a very expressive face, and I can’t look directly at her pursed lips.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki! That’s enough!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Abandoning the calm tone she had used earlier, Kinoshita-san dismissed her without question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, well. There’s no need for you sisters to fight. We can all get along here…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, will you please stay out of it? I told you to shut up, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to hold the situation together, but it seemed like I couldn’t do it after all. It was best to do as I was told and keep my mouth shut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going home today, then. I don’t have time to play with my sister!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan sticks out her tongue in a small, sticky gesture, showing a tiny bit of resistance to her older sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was relieved to hear that she was finally going home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai, let’s talk again sometime!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Saying this, Uzuki-chan squeezed my hand as we left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“’…Ackk!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Take care of my sister for me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan giggles and says something suggestive while her cheeks are forming cute dimples.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki, hey, what are you doing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, yes, yes! Well, goodbye then!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Waving her hands in a small gesture, Uzuki leaves the classroom as if she was jumping up and down, like an excited child.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hah… I’m sorry for having such a pigheaded little sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san let out a loud sigh as if apologizing for her sister’s rudeness, but I forgot to reply back to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was staring dumbfounded at those hands that Uzuki-chan had held earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At that moment, I was psychometricizing Uzuki-chan.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">I have to do my job as an agent too, or else dad would get mad at me!</span></i></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Again I heard another absurd voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Is Uzuki an agent too? What, your father’s one too?</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Don’t worry about what Uzuki says. She says such stuff without thinking much!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san’s head was in her hands as if she wanted to erase her memory of the entire series of events caused by Uzuki-chan’s intrusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I was flustered in another way, unable to sort out the current situation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Excuse me? What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita-san stares at me from a distance, squinting, as she opens her mouth with a pout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, nothing…  She’s a cute little sister.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She’s not cute! Oh, God!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I meant it as a compliment, but Kinoshita-san seemed a little offended, her cheeks puffing out in annoyance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t have the luxury of being delighted by Kinoshita-san’s newfound expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is Kinoshita-san an agent in the family?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You mean it’s not on the level of a part-time job or something, but a serious family business?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Instead of being alone with her and clearing up the misunderstanding we had, I learned yet another one of Kinoshita-san’s secrets.</span></p>
