<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 7 - That Moment Was A Swing To My Heart.</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I left Satsuki-kun and went back home, I found Uzuki lying down on the sofa watching the TV in her school uniform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Welcome home, sis. So, how was he?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What? How’s who?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My voice rises as I remember Satsuki-kun’s face, who was with me until just a moment ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s about the vice principal. I called you, didn’t I? You said you were headed towards the main street after school.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uhh. No further developments on that case yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, ok. Thanks for the hard work.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki seemed uninterested in the topic any further and went back to watching TV.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I take the milk out of the refrigerator and pour it into a glass. I drank it all down in one gulp and reset my mixed-up mind back into a blank slate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had followed the vice principal to the main street after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I let go of my surveillance of the vice principal in the middle of the day. It was no use, I had more important things to do other than work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Uzuki. Do you know what Northern Brand is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I casually asked her about the CD Satsuki-kun had just bought, assuming that the trendy and active Uzuki would know about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No bra? It’s a band, right? Of course I know about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No-no-no, no bra?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s an abbreviation. Why are you so ashamed about it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It took me a little while to realize that it was an abbreviation for Northern Brand. I thought Uzuki was just teasing me again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s all the buzz these days, you know? Sis, were you ever interested in music?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t care about it. It’s just small talk”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was not familiar with any of the latest music these days, but I thought I would give it a listen if Satsuki-kun was the one who recommended it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">To begin with, I have no hobbies whatsoever. I have been only interested in my work as an agent, so when Satsuki asked me about what I liked, I couldn’t give back a response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Does he think I’m a boring woman? Although it </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is</span></i><span class="calibre8"> true…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, I thought they had a new song coming out soon?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s out today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tell her what I know</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really? What happened? Actually, why do you know so much about it in the first place? You don’t have a device in your room to listen </span><span class="calibre8">to CDs, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki rises and looks at me with curiosity present in her eyes. I had never talked about music with Uzuki before, so it was only natural </span><span class="calibre8">for her to be intrigued by this topic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s nothing. I told you, it was just small talk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hmmm. By the way, what happened with Satsuki-senpai? Have you made any progress with him yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki leans back from the couch and gives me a bad look, as if what we just talked about was blown away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What progress! There’s nothing to say about that…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know what Uzuki would say if she knew that we were spending time together after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why I told you I’d support you, sis. If you leave it to your sister, you’ll graduate from high school with someone by your side. Your youth is shorter than you think, you </span><span class="calibre8">know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You have no right to say that to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m doing this for my sister who can’t be honest with anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why it’s none of your business! Okay, Bye!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I flee the living room, trying not to overheat any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re so stubborn, big sister! I’ll support you on my own now!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard Uzuki’s disturbing words, but if I let it bother me any longer, it would only make her get carried away even further. What do you mean, “support”? I decided it was best </span><span class="calibre8">to leave her alone and went back to my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I took off my uniform and changed into my loungewear, I was still feeling flustered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After school, I felt like someone was following me, so I went for a different route than usual, but I didn’t expect it to be Satsuki-kun. I drove him to the old stadium site and </span><span class="calibre8">interrogated him and found that the tailing was just a misunderstanding, but then we decided to go to the CD store together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt guilty about throwing away my job as an agent, but I also needed to cover up my behavior.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But going out shopping alone with him after school was…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Wait. Wasn’t that a date…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know I said all that stuff to Uzuki just now, but isn’t this what we call ‘progress’?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just remembering it makes my face flush hot, and I dive onto the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Mm-hmm</span></i><span class="calibre8">.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A funny laugh escapes from me because I had been trying so hard to hold back when I was with Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> “Oh, right” I searched for ‘No Bra’ on my phone, which Satsuki-kun had recommended to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kya!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then the screen is lined with naughty images of real women without bras, which startles me and makes me fumble my phone. What am I even searching for…!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I properly searched for “Northern Brand” and quickly found a PV of their latest song. They seemed to be a rock band, with a slim, </span><span class="calibre8">glasses-wearing guy as the vocalist, and lyrics </span><span class="calibre8">that seemed to be marketed towards the youth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I listened to a few songs and tried to like them too, but I don’t usually listen to much music, so I couldn’t tell if they were good or bad. I need to listen to them a little more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I lay on my bed and watched No Bra’s music videos, I thought back to what happened after-school today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the first time I went to a CD store, and I had a lot of fun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I walked in, I saw the classical music shelf and I suddenly remembered last year’s festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It wasn’t at the cafe stall that I first got to know about Satsuki-kun last year.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the morning of the festival, when Satsuki was playing the piano in the gym.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure he didn’t know I was watching him at that time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At that moment, my heart was shaken.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre8">Last year’s festival.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On that day, there were presentations by clubs and volunteers in the gymnasium in the morning, and the students were basically free to do whatever they wanted to do in the meantime.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Our class was having a café in the stalls of the Piloti, and we were supposed to take turns being in charge of the store. I had the </span><span class="calibre8">afternoon shift, so until then I was in the gym </span><span class="calibre8">watching the presentations going about. I wasn’t bored watching the drama and calligraphy clubs perform, and I didn’t stand out much from the crowd by myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The last program of the morning was a concert by the alumni, and I planned to watch this one and then head off to man the class stall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The singer is Mayo Shiraishi, an alumna and soprano singer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As the emcee introduced, our high school festival often has alumni as guests.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shiraishi-senpai was already a well-known soprano singer who had won prizes in well-known competitions while attending a music </span><span class="calibre8">college after graduating from Otomachi High School. Even I knew her just by her reputation and name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A grand piano was set up in the center of the stage, and the piano player entered alone first. He was a boy in a uniform, which was a bit surprising to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without glancing at the audience, he bowed his head and sat down on a chair. It was too dark to see his face, but I could see that he </span><span class="calibre8">was nervous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shiraishi-senpai, dressed in a bright red dress, entered next. This time, she was met with loud applause.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shiraishi-senpai bowed deeply, and as soon as she looked up, the applause stopped. Silence fell on the stage, and I couldn’t help but hold my breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shiraishi-senpai said a few words to the boy at the piano, and soon the prelude began.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The sound of the piano, which sounded like a drop of water, echoed through the gymnasium like a ripple.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And soon after, Shiraishi-senpai, the star of the show, began to sing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her soprano voice overlapped with the piano accompaniment. The lyrics were in a foreign language and I had no idea what they meant, but I could sense their beauty in her speech.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The soft tones of the piano and the clear voice melted into my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The clear melody vibrates my eardrums, makes my skin milky, and the sound forms a clear picture in my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I gently close my eyes, and a landscape I have never seen before unfolds behind my pitch-black eyelids. There are mountains, the sky, a river, and the wind seems to be blowing softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This music shows me things I have never seen before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the first time I had ever felt such a sensation, and it was as if something was sprouting from within my empty heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s Donaudi’s music, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After the first song, I heard two girls sitting next to me whispering in my ear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Donaudi? I didn’t know at the time, of course, that he was the composer of this piece.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“He’s playing the piano, even though he’s a guy!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Look at that face. He’s in his own world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time I heard a heartless voice from the back seat making fun of his performance. It was a terrible thing to say, even though gender has nothing to do with playing the </span><span class="calibre8">piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought about turning around and retorting back at them, but I held my ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As if to rebel against the bad comments, I concentrated only on the sound of the piano. The next thing I knew, I was becoming more and more interested in the boy who was playing the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Why did he decide to play the piano? Has he been doing it ever since they were little? Did he want to do it on his own? Did no one object to his wishes?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">All my life I had been subconsciously comparing myself, who repeatedly worked as an agent, to that boy who played the piano. Perhaps I was simply envious of him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was thinking about this in a daze, something unusual happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><b class="calibre13">─ ─ ─ Buzz.</b></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A low, clearly out-of-tune sound, a sound so low that even I could hear it, and then the performance had stopped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was a murmur from the audience who sensed something was wrong, but Shiraishi continued to sing as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The piano performance stopped again, and although I thought it was a staged event, I felt a buzz in my chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shiraishi-senpai sang a cappella until the end, while the piano player remained motionless with his face down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seemed that the pianist had failed in his performance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps it was Shiraishi’s ad-lib to sing the whole song as a cappella.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When the song was over, she called out to the piano player. She did not seem to blame him for his mistake, which reassured me, but then a voice came from the audience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-kun! That was brilliant!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was probably a friend of the accompanied pianist. It was an encouraging cheer, but a chuckle escaped from the audience. The boy’s voice sounded both comforting and sarcastic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was then that I learned the name of the piano player, Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was impressed and even respected Satsuki-kun, who did his best even though he was being laughed at.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun performed very well in front of such a large audience. I could never do such a thing in front of so many people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was really moved by his performance and thought it was really cool.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Later that afternoon, I was tending to my class café when a customer came up to talk to me. I lied to him that I had been tending to the store all morning, but I didn’t expect the </span><span class="calibre8">customer to be Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, there was no way I could tell him what I thought of the performance I had just witnessed. I was too nervous to speak back to </span><span class="calibre8">him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is how I met Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This encounter was just a point in our lives, it never truly became a line that grew further and further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think he’s cool and I respect him a lot. I was impressed by his piano performance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wish I could play the piano like him… there were times I thought about that too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But that was it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I kept this feeling inside my heart, prioritizing being an agent over anything else. I can’t prioritize what </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">I</span></i><span class="calibre8"> want to do when I’m living as an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After school today, I happened to find a Donaudi CD in the classical section of a CD store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the piece that Satsuki-kun had played at the school festival. I remembered that it was a very gentle piece of music.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre8">I hope to hear Satsuki-kun play the piano again someday.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Something is changing inside of me to even be able to think of such a bright future.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even today, I had abandoned my work and followed Satsuki-kun instead…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The agent me and the real me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretended not to notice that the balance I had been protecting all this time was about to get reversed.</span></p>
