<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 11-It’s All Your Fault, Satsuki-kun</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey sis, welcome home”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without looking at Uzuki’s face as she was relaxing in the living room, I headed straight to my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi, are you back?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to go up the stairs when my mother stopped me for something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She came out of the kitchen wearing her apron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m home. I’ll go change real quick.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Hiding my face with my hair, I ran up the stairs as if to escape from her for the time being.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I bought a cake for dessert. It’s Yayoi’s favorite!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I ran into my room, but I ended up being pulled back by the cake from my favorite store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The first thing I did when I got to my room was put down my bag and check my face in the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My usual dull face still had a flushed shade present on it. I wondered what my mother would say if she saw me like this. Of course, I’m sure that Uzuki would just tease me as per usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Thinking that I was like this in front of Satsuki-kun makes my whole body get warmer. I wonder if my classmates saw me look like this too?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Today, Satsuki-kun was acting a little strange..</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">During lunch break, he told me he wanted to know more about me…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After school, he invited me to go out with him, this time he said so in front of everyone in the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It felt as if Christmas and my birthday had come at the exact same time. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What am I all so excited about! I-I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pressed my cheeks with both hands, but they still felt like they were on fire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put my hand on my forehead again and again, thinking that I might have developed a fever. On my way home from school, I passed by my house feeling very lightheaded.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is all Satsuki-kun’s fault.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At school, I have given up on everything by blocking out my emotions to establish myself as an agent, but I didn’t expect Satsuki-kun to ask me out so boldly…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But, I told myself not to get too carried away with this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun only asked me out because he was concerned about me being alone all the time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Do you want to be alone forever?</span></i><span class="calibre8">‘</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun’s voice from that time comes back to my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a cruel question to ask me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have only one answer to this question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I couldn’t say that to him, so I had to keep quiet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s how I’ve been trying to suggest it to myself, but I can’t fool myself anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s something more precious than words being glued to the surface like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think this sound that has been ringing inside my heart for the past six months is the real truth behind my feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to go out with Satsuki-kun…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Whilst alone in my room, I mumble quietly to confirm that I wasn’t dreaming.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yesterday, Uzuki had told me something like this too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said I should do what I want to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Do I look that incompetent to her? Do I look like I’m holding myself back?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I just want to live my life like a normal high school girl, even though I’m an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">…What </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">is </span></i><span class="calibre8">it like to be a typical high school girl?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Isn’t it like going on dates with the boys in your class?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have no idea if that’s the case, but it’s what I wanted to do right now. I wonder if this is the so-called ‘destiny’ of them?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It makes me want to believe in that thing Uzuki said one day about ‘fate’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is this… a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A question suddenly popped into my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Going out with boys on your day off…. Isn’t this what you call– a date?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as I put it into words, something flipped inside me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought dating was something that only happened in dramas and comic books and had nothing to do with me, who is an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What should I do now…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I agreed to it on the spur of the moment, but I  finally realized the gravity of the situation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A date, what do people do on a date?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had a few chats with Satsuki-kun, but they were all just spur-of-the-moment conversations, and Uzuki was there between us too. What should I talk about on a date where I’m alone with him?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Where would we go together on a date? Do we have dinner or something? Eh, and then? Where do we…? (TLN: You and I know damn well where this leads to ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I wandered around the room, my head began to boil as I daydreamed about the end of the date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Ki-kiss…?!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I quickly covered up my face with my hands and bit my lip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, no, no! Don’t think such weird thoughts! That’s already beyond the boundaries of a first date!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I fell onto the bed and rolled over repeatedly, which resulted in me slamming my head against the opposite wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ouch~…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I get up while rubbing my bruised head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Don’t worry, this is just like how doing a job as an agent works; let’s see, there’s no distinct set of objectives. No target prep, no data and– </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, Satsuki-kun’s not a target…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Oh no, the more I think about it, the more confused I become. Now I feel like I have a really high fever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I take off my uniform to change and calm down for now. I grabbed my usual black hoodie that was folded on the bed, and my blood ran cold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-I have no clothes to wear!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t help but scream out loud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Unable to sit still, I spin around the room in a figure-eight motion like what Japii would do when playing around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I open the closet whilst in my underwear and find that the clothes hanging in there are completely black. Moreover, they were all just jerseys, hoodies, sweatshirts, <i class="calibre12">etc.</i> These are </span><span class="calibre8">clothes that might be perfect for doing any agent work during the night, but none of them were clothes that I could properly wear on a date. The fact that I had always chosen clothes based solely on the ease of movement and discreteness had backfired hard on me here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pulled out every piece of clothing I could find in the closet, and laid them out on the bed and floor, it just served to make the room look really black.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What am I going to do…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s just as I expected, I can’t go on a date wearing a jersey… neither can I wear all this pitch black looking clothes…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not just the color though. I don’t even own a skirt, and I’ve never really worn a girly dress. The only bottoms that I could just barely wear on the date were my black skinny </span><span class="calibre8">jeans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I sat down on the bed and looked up to the heavens.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Should I go there in my uniform? No, no. That could work for a scenario after school, but on a day off…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Do I want to turn him down now? But I don’t even know Satsuki-kun’s contact information…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Hah…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Somehow today’s sigh felt a bit different than usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was unusual for me to worry about something other than work. And to be worried about what to wear on a date was just like being a normal high school girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Fufu</span></i><span class="calibre8">, a small laugh leaked out of my mouth. No, no, no! This is not the time to laugh!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I was ashamed of my naturally flushed cheeks, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs with a thud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, I’m going to eat the cake soon, so hurry up and come downstairs!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The door to the room was opened forcefully, and Uzuki entered without my permission.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wait, you’re not allowed to…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Seeing the disaster in my room, Uzuki frowned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Clothes thrown all over the room and me in my underwear, my face was reddening at the sight of being exposed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s really not like me, is it…</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, I heard you have a date tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wai-, Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I went down to the living room to eat the cake that my mom had bought for me, and Uzuki quickly blurted out something very unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When Uzuki saw me pulling out all my clothes and worrying about them, I couldn’t find an excuse and spilled the beans about my date with Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh my, that’s rare.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom glanced at me and smiled as she set out the plate of cake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I swallowed down my awkward thoughts with a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why you were so worried that you didn’t have any clothes to wear! You’re so cute, sis!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not worried at all!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can only deny it to Uzuki, who shakes her head as she was mimicking how I was in my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi, you’ve always liked black clothes ever since you were little.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not that I like them a lot…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Whenever I thought about work, I always chose clothes with an emphasis on convenience and functionality. I didn’t go to any fashionable cafes or hang out with friends. </span><span class="calibre8">Anything worked as long as it fit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still wear black jerseys and bottoms, but I still get jealous of the gorgeous strawberries in the shortcake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“They’re so black that I wonder what kind of dark organization you belong to, Sis.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Shut up!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki, who’s an agent herself, says something that irks me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So what are you going to do? Are you going on a date dressed like a pitch-black ninja? You look like a kunoichi who just left her ninja village for the first time in her life! It’s a date, that is, kyaa~!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t help but get angry at Uzuki for finding my predicament amusing, but I had nothing to say back to her in return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why don’t you go shopping for clothes together then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom said so, whilst staring at my pitch-black attire.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Kinoshita Koyomi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom organizes all the agent work for this family of mine. Although she’s not involved in the actual work like my father and sister, she receives offers from clients and manages </span><span class="calibre8">the Kinoshita family’s agent work, including negotiating and deciding whether or not to take on any specific project.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mother wears a sweater that’s so open at the neck that you can see her collarbone clearly, and a thin silver necklace shines around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She has a style like a foreign model, big eyes, is beautiful and stylish, and has a glamorous look that makes it hard to believe that she’s my mother. And she’s also so kind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Since it’s your date, why don’t you let Satsuki-senpai pick it out for you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki’s just trying to be funny, giving me unnecessary advice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But I don’t have clothes to go clothes shopping on that date!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I say to myself and feel really pathetic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hear Uzuki and my mother sigh. Even my family feels sorry for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi has reached the age where she has to worry about being fashionable, hasn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom smiles at me with her cheekbones stretched out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re in the second year of high school, Sis. You shouldn’t be so serious. If it were the Edo period, you’d definitely be married by now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Shut up, Uzuki!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tell off Uzuki, who always has so many words to say to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Why does she seem to be having more fun than me right now? No, she’s just teasing me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Hmph</span></i><span class="calibre8">, I’m just going to put on my uniform.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt embarrassed that I was worried about something like this. It doesn’t suit me and I hate it, but I have no choice but to go in my uniform to not make me look bad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, that’s just like saying you don’t have any clothes to wear on a date! Besides, boys get excited at the prospect of seeing you in your casual clothes! You can’t take away the boys’ hopes and dreams.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know anything about that. Fukase-kun is not like that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you know about Satsuki-senpai? What, has he already confessed or…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“O-o-o-o-o-of course not!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I desperately denied her words. If I bothered this with Uzuki, my rhythm would be disturbed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not going to talk about this in front of mom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You have a habit of staring at Satsuki-senpai, so you should at least wear something cute for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki said in a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wait, what do you mean by that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Whenever you make eye contact with Satsuki-senpai, you always glare at him, don’t you? That’s not a good impression, so don’t do it tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki wrinkles her eyebrows and pretends to glare at me as she says that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really…? Do I glare at him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She points it out, and I can’t help but feel a little tense around my brow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Not only does my face turn red in front of him, but I’m also apparently glaring at him? You’re lying, aren’t you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Was that an unconscious move? You’re really not being honest with him, Sis. You’re like a schoolboy who’s mean to someone he likes!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I told you it’s not like that!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I cover my mouth with my hand as I turn my face away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Come to think of it, I think that Satsuki-kun often had a half-smile and scared expression on his face whenever his eyes met mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Was that because I was glaring at him?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Let me lend you my clothes! You know, a big sister’s shame is also a little sister’s shame! I’ll bring it to you, so just wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After swallowing the cake, Uzuki ran back to her room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m no longer in the mood to decide what clothes I should wear. I’m feeling so embarrassed that my face is on fire from the discovery of the me that I didn’t know about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How am I going to meet Satsuki-kun with a straight face tomorrow…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is his name Satsuki-kun, that boy?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As my mother, who had been gently watching our argument, uttered that name, the back of my mind shook.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, but… Uzuki is just exaggerating, we’re just going out for a bit. It’s not like a date or anything, really…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I reach for the second cake as if to cover my true feelings up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can also reveal a little bit of my true feelings to my mom. She’s always thinking about me. I’ve been able to continue to be an agent so that I don’t make my mom sad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You didn’t say anything about that recently.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She smiles at me, and I pout back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’ve changed, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly she says something like that and I look up at her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I haven’t changed. I’m…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I take a bite of the cake as if to shrug it off quietly. The sweetness of the whipped cream and the tartness of the strawberries gradually spread out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“There is nothing wrong with changing. Yayoi’s feelings are hers and hers alone, and your life is yours to decide.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Leaning back in her chair, my mom smiles gently at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel as if my heart has been touched by her sweet words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe she knows that I’m feeling unsure about it. Or that I really don’t want to be an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll lend you my clothes, don’t worry. It’s better than leaving it to Uzuki’s sense of style, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time, my mother winks at me, as if trying to dismiss my earlier feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If it’s my mom’s sense of style, I have nothing to worry about…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is it okay to… I don’t know if this is a good idea.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But I don’t know what to do…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You can do what you want to do. If you don’t have fun, Satsuki-kun will be sad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At my mother’s words, I drink a cup of cold tea to calm my mind. The sweetness in my mouth gradually disappears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Do what I want to do…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…So?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Tomorrow you can forget about everything in your life and just have fun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She affirms me with those words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was so happy to see your face turn red and you were glaring at him too. That’s just you being very honest, Yayoi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Fufufu</span></i><span class="calibre8">, my mom laughed at my actions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m an honest person…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sis, how about something like this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki comes running down the stairs at a trot, interrupting mom’s conversation with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as she entered the living room, she raised the clothes she had brought for me above her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“A shark hoodie! It’s super cute! It’s oversized so even you can wear it with no problems!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The large gray hoodie has the word “SAME” printed on the chest in an illustration of a shark, and the hood is decorated with jagged fangs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki’s big smile makes my head hurt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Mom, can I borrow your clothes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My mom and I looked at each other and tilted our heads down at my sister’s fashion sense.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I borrowed a spring-like light blue flared skirt from my mom and decided to wear a white blouse over it. She said I should go for a brighter color, but even this is too dazzling for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried it on in my room and looked at it in the mirror.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am just as tall as my mom, so the size fits me perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps it’s because I’m used to a black figure, but I can’t look at it directly. The ribbon on the waist of the skirt alone is just barely brave enough to make me wear it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had never worn a skirt outside of my school uniform, so it was something very new for me. I ended up spinning around like a model. The softly billowing skirt seems to be filled with hope. It makes my heart flutter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Imagining walking beside Satsuki in such an outfit makes my face hot again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Today, in front of everyone, he asked me out so openly. Of course I was embarrassed, but more than that, I was happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not me as an agent who has such thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is this the real me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt much better after my mom’s words earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She told me that I could decide my life for myself. She said I should do what I want to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The rest is up to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have a date with Satsuki-kun…… </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ll do my best tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I may not be able to stop my face from turning red, but I really need to stop glaring at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I rub my fingers between my eyebrows and blink repeatedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have a lot of things to tell him. Yes. Maybe I should ask Satsuki-kun about that?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There were so many things I wanted to do. I end up finding things I want to do, surprisingly so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have high hopes for so many things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s all your fault, Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
