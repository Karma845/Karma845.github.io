<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 11: Gal and a Mini Runaway</h1>


<p>Six days after the day I helped out at Nakamachi’s Bakery.</p>
<p>Late in the night on a certain Friday, past midnight.</p>
<p>After my parents had gone to bed, I was sitting on the living room sofa watching a variety show.</p>
<p>Then, beside me, there was a slight bump. She had just finished taking a bath and sat down.</p>

<p>“How are you doing? Lately, are you enjoying school?”</p>

<p>Her name is Asako Yoda.</p>
<p>Currently a third-year university student, she’s my older sister who loves movies so much that she’s a member of the university’s film club.</p>
<p>With reasonably attractive features, a devastatingly small chest, and a not-so-slender figure… for some reason, she’s moderately popular at the university and is quite the extroverted type, with many friends.</p>
<p>At her core, she’s an introvert like me, but she’s skilled at putting on a facade that fits in with her surroundings.</p>
<p>I find myself both respecting and despising that about her.</p>
<p>And so, in response to my sister’s question, ‘Lately, are you enjoying school??’ I answered like this.</p>

<p>“It’s alright.”</p>
<p>“What an uninteresting response… But I’ve been getting the feeling that you’ve been going to school with a relatively cheerful attitude lately. Ryu-kun, did something good happen?”</p>
<p>“…I’m going to ignore you.”</p>
<p>“If you declare that you’re ignoring me, then that means m not you’re really ignoring me, huh… But well, if you’re doing fine, there’s no need for Onēchan to worry,”</p>

<p>Said my nagging sister as she averted her gaze from me and turned toward the TV screen.</p>
<p>…My sister has this overprotective side when it comes to me, which I both appreciate and find annoying.</p>
<p>It seems I’m not good at straightforwardly acknowledging family matters.</p>
<p>Staying that way, the two of us sat in the living room, watching a variety show, when suddenly…</p>
<p>I don’t even understand why, but a question like this came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Hold Up?</p>
<p>“Hey. Do you think male-female friendships can exist?”</p>
<p>“…What’s gotten into you all of a sudden? Are you at that age? Are you in the midst of your youth or something?”</p>
<p>“Wrong…There was this light novel I read recently that dealt with male-female friendships, and I just got a little curious.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, it’s about two-dimensional stuff… I thought maybe something happened to my little brother, and he’s having some kind of youthful dilemma.”</p>

<p>My sister said that with a disappointed look.</p>
<p>…I wasn’t exactly lying. Ever since I met Tsumakawa, I’ve found myself prioritizing reading light novels that focus on friendships between boys and girls.</p>
<p>——I can’t help but wonder if this otaku is trying to learn from light novels about real-life problems he’s facing!?</p>
<p>While I was giving myself a hard time, I continued talking.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell Tsumakawa this, but my true feelings, which I could only share with my family, were packed into these words.</p>

<p>“I don’t think friendship between a man and a woman is possible.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? What’s the reasoning behind that?”</p>

<p>“Men see women, and women see men; through a sexual lens no matter what. …The feeling of ‘wanting to stay just friends forever’ is impossible when both sides see each other in that way. Because we’re of the opposite sex. If we’re together all the time, we’ll develop feelings for each other. And if we deliberately maintain a moderate distance to prevent that, we can’t call that a friendship anymore. In other words, for a man and a woman to be together as pure friends, one or both of them would have to have… ‘I actually like the other person, but I’ll endure it within the framework of friendship.’. I think something like that is necessary.”</p>
<p>“…hey, Ryu-kun. Have you possibly made a close female friend?”</p>
<p>“Onēchan, why did the conversation suddenly take this turn?”</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s been a while since you called me ‘Onēchan.’ I’m so happy, and I can tell you’re flustered right now.”</p>

<p>My sister said that with an intentionally exaggerated look of exasperation.</p>
<p>Then, with a somewhat happy smile, she patted my shoulder a few times before continuing.</p>

<p>“But you know… Ryu-kun, you said that male-female friendships don’t work if they’re not willing to endure, but if they can make it work by enduring, then isn’t that still friendship?”</p>
<p>“Th-that is… “</p>
<p>“Well, what you’re saying isn’t entirely wrong, Ryu-kun. But let me give you an answer, as your Onēchan, to your dilemma about male-female relationships. Male-female friendships can exist. However, that’s only the case when it’s a friendship between a guy and a girl who both have separate romantic interests…Friendships between men and women that don’t work out, I’m sure there are plenty of those in this world as well, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.””</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“So, what’s your take, Ryu-kun? Do you want to be friends with that girl?”</p>

<p>After my sister’s words, I pondered for a while.</p>
<p>Then, after a long silence, what finally came out of my mouth was… something so feeble that I wasn’t sure if I could call it an answer.</p>

<p>“…I can’t really bring myself to think it’s okay for us to become friends…”</p>
<p>“Wow, I can’t believe you’re still at that stage (stuck)! This girl must be going through a lot…!”</p>

<p>My sister said that, putting her hand on her forehead and looking up at the ceiling. It was an extremely unpleasant reaction.</p>
<p>Stop it, don’t tease your sulky brother.</p>
<p>I’m delicate, okay?</p>

<p>Just as I was about to retort to my sister, in that instant—buzz, buzz.</p>
<p>My smartphone, placed on the table, vibrated briefly.</p>
<p>When I checked my phone, there was a message from Tsumakawa displayed on it,</p>

<p>『Can I stay over at Yoda’s place today?』</p>

<p>I widened my eyes in surprise to a message I hadn’t even anticipated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my sister, seeing me like that, chuckled a bit and casually said,</p>

<p>“Be careful not to message her too much for fear that you might be disliked.”</p>

<p>No, it’s not me!</p>
<p>She’s the one who’s sending me a bunch of messages!</p>


<p>Afterward, in a hurry, I replied to Tsumakawa with,『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>After a few exchanges, I ended up agreeing to meet her at a small park not far from my house.</p>
<p>Riding my bike as fast as I could, I reached the park, situated in the midst of a residential area, in about five minutes.</p>
<p>There, I searched for Tsumakawa, who seemed to be waiting.</p>
<p>Then, I saw her——</p>
<p>Sitting on a lonely swing, Tsumakawa was gazing intently at the ground with red, tear-stained eyes.</p>
<p>…I’ve never seen her this weak before…</p>

<p>Thinking that, I parked my bike in the park and rushed over to Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>She also noticed my arrival and slowly walked towards me.</p>
<p>Meeting her in the center of the park like this, Tsumakawa suddenly embraced me tightly.</p>

<p>“Whoa, what’s going on, Tsumakawa-san!?”</p>
<p>“Ughhh… Yoda…”</p>

<p>Naturally, I was taken aback, but she didn’t seem to care about my flustered state at all.</p>
<p>She clung to me as if she was tying a knot. She wrapped her arms around my waist and buried her face in my chest. ‘Yoda, Yoda…’ she called my name multiple times, rubbing her tear-streaked face against my chest.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a child seeking comfort from their mother in times of sadness.</p>
<p>…I won’t be able to easily free myself from her embrace in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>So there I was, being hugged by a three-dimensional outgoing gal, and although my heart was naturally pounding… I stood there stiffly for almost five minutes!!</p>
<p>Suddenly, she let go of me from her embrace and wiped her makeup-smudged eyes with tears.</p>

<p>“Thank you for coming…”</p>
<p>“S-sure, but… why did you send that kind of message?”</p>
<p>“It’s really not a big deal, but… I ran away from home.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty big deal, okay!?”</p>

<p>After exclaiming in surprise, I suggested, ‘L-let’s sit down for now,’ and invited her to the nearby bench.</p>
<p>Then, after making Tsumakawa, who was still sniffling, sit on the bench, I took a seat next to her, leaving some space between us, and asked,</p>

<p>“S-so, what happened…?”</p>
<p>“…Well, today, Miruru-senpai had her birthday party, you see? So, Shizushi-senpai and the others reserved a dart bar and had a grand celebration. We had people like Riseri-chan and Mina-rin coming to the party… and Kanachamu prepared really thoughtful and stylish birthday presents, it was the best party ever. Then, around 9 in the evening, Shizushi-senpai said, ‘It’s getting late, so high schoolers should head home for now.’ . We wanted to keep celebrating Miruru-senpai, but they didn’t let us; so the underage group, including me, all got on the train and went home.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“But you know, since we were still excited, we all went to the nearby McDonald’s for some food, and Kanacamu was telling us stories about some sketchy guy she used to date who stole money from her wallet, but she forgave him because he was handsome. I told them that my guy was better than hers, they didn’t really get what I meant, so maybe I explained it poorly…well, ‘I’m confident in my love, so it’s fine even if no one else understands’, I said something like that, they all went like, ‘That’s so true! ‘”</p>
<p>“…Uh-huh…”</p>
<p>“And then——Fuumi went to get a Big Mac even though it was midnight! Everyone laughed like, ‘Are you serious, going for a Big Mac in the middle of the night, even though you’re a pro model?’ But then, Yupiko said, ‘Even though Fuumi eats without caring about calories at night, she still maintains that figure, it’s so unfair!’. She’s right; isn’t that unfair? I mean, if I eat even a bit extra, I’d turn into a balloon. Why doesn’t Fuumi have the same problem? So, when I asked Fuumi about it, she said, ‘Isn’t Miona senpai the one who eats too much?’ she responded with, ‘Aren’t you eating too much, Miomine-senpai?’ She was the one overeating! During that conversation, everyone was seriously irritated and jealous of Fuumi, you know? …Kanachamu even went to get fries in the spur of the moment and regretted it later. When I joked, ‘You’ll be Chubby-chamu by tomorrow,’ she got so mad, I had to desperately apologize afterward——”</p>
<p>“…Um…Tsumakawa-san? It’s really hard for me to say this, but could you please get to the main points…?”</p>
<p>“…Geez, Yoda, you’re so terrible…”</p>
<p>“Ahh, sorry Tsumakawa-san! I knew I shouldn’t say this, but you were just going on and on with such a rambling conversation like that; well, I kind of wanted to offer a word of advice, okay?!” “</p>
<p>“That’s not a way of showing support… uuugh…. “</p>
<p>In response to my nonchalant remark, Tsumakawa-san, who already seemed down, cast her eyes downward with an even more melancholic expression.</p>
<p>…Sigh. This is why introverts who lack experience in conversations with girls are like this!</p>
<p>Even though I definitely thought, ‘Wow, this gal’s story is way too long,’ I should have just become a nodding and agreeing conversational machine at that moment…</p>

<p>“A-anyway, I’m sorry, Tsumakawa-san… It’s fine if you want to take your time…”</p>
<p>“Ugh… If Yoda says so, I’ll just get to the main points…”</p>

<p>With my words, Tsumakawa managed to recover a bit, and she continued her story with a sad expression.</p>

<p>“And then, while we were hanging out and chatting at McDonald’s, it somehow got really late, past midnight, and we ended up getting home after midnight… I got yelled at by my dad…”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“Our curfew is midnight, so usually, I would be home by then, but today, it got past that… but this is the first time, so I thought maybe my dad wouldn’t get mad, but then he started yelling at me… And you know what he said to my mom, who defended me by saying, ‘Why don’t you just forgive her?’ He said, ‘Aren’t you the one who’s responsible for her bad behavior?’… And I got mad and snapped at him… “</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>” ‘Don’t blame my bad behavior on Mom’s education, you damn old man!’ and I said some really foul stuff like that… So, we got into a fight, and then… with just my wallet and phone, I kind of ran away from home… “</p>
<p>“I see… So, that’s why you sent that message…”</p>
<p>“…Even though the birthday party was so much fun… Today is the worst… Why is it that whenever I’m in the best mood, that damn old man ruins everything? I want to run away from home…”</p>

<p>As Tsumakawa spoke, her teary eyes glistened, and she wiped them with both hands. Her weakened state was evident to anyone.</p>
<p>The tears had smudged her makeup around her eyes, and the whites of her eyes were bloodshot.</p>
<p>Her expression was gloomy, and the usual lively tone in her voice had vanished.</p>
<p>In this clearly vulnerable state, she turned toward me and made a small request in a soft voice:</p>

<p>“So, um… if it’s alright, could I stay over at Yoda’s place? I’d be really happy… if you’re okay with that…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>To be honest, I thought it was an impossible request.</p>
<p>I mean, logically speaking, it’s just not right for a high school boy to have a girl whom he’s not even dating stay over at his house.</p>
<p>Such a thing is clearly inappropriate… It’s fine if you’re in a romantic relationship and can do whatever you want. There’s no need to condemn such a situation.</p>
<p>But in our case, in the relationship between Tsumakawa and me, is it acceptable for something like this?</p>


<p>In the relationship between Tsumakawa and me, is it acceptable for something like this?</p>
<p>As I pondered over this, Tsumakawa, who looked visibly downcast, continued in a dejected tone:</p>

<p>“…I’m sorry for asking something impossible. But… I just want to be with you right now…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Running away from home, being alone, and crying… After that, the first person I contacted, even before anyone else, was you. On this night when I felt so sad, my heart was crying out for Yoda’s help… So, I sent a message on LINE, but… was it bothersome for you…?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“It’s okay. For now, I’ll spend the night at a net cafe or something. I might message you occasionally, but well… if you can, within your capacity, please respond…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“…I was happy that you came to see me. Well, see you at school…”</p>

<p>Looking at me, who didn’t say anything, Tsumakawa, with a lonely expression, stood up from the bench quietly.</p>
<p>She is in no condition to spend the night alone.</p>
<p>Still, she seemed to realize that she wouldn’t get help from me, so she was about to leave the park alone…</p>

<p>Seeing that, I felt a sharp pain in my chest and made a decision.</p>
<p>——It was probably the wrong choice.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa and I should never sleep under the same roof. So, normally, I should reject her request to stay at my house.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t forgive myself for not being able to help her here at this moment.</p>
<p>This feeling is probably not friendship or love.</p>
<p>Because I’m not trying to help Tsumakawa out of a desire to help her her. It’s not that… It’s just that I can’t stand the thought of leaving Tsumakawa, who has been so kind to me, in a state where she needs help and abandoning her.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to do whatever I can to avoid that.</p>

<p>In essence, it’s because I don’t want to abandon her that I’m trying to help her——This is also another hypocritical act on my part.</p>
<p>Just like when I helped out at Nakamachi’s bakery, I feel a strong resistance toward having this seen as pure goodwill… As I finished pondering that point, Tsumakawa, with a face on the verge of tears, turned her back to me and began walking out of the park toward the outside.</p>
<p>Because of me not reaching out my hand, she would be alone once again.</p>
<p>Disliking that idea, I instinctively grabbed her wrist and said</p>
<p>“Wait… I, I’ll try asking…”</p>
<p>“—huh…?”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask my parents or something. You can sit down first for now…”</p>
<p>“…uuuuu….”</p>

<p>Upon my words, Tsumakawa-san’s eyes brimmed with tears and she started crying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I hastily let go of her wrist that I had grabbed.</p>
<p>I had touched Tsumakawa-san’s body on my own… How presumptuous of me…</p>
<p>As I was reflecting on that, she spread her arms out to the sides with her tear-streaked face and then said in a pleading voice,</p>

<p>“Is it okay if I, um… hold you?”</p>
<p>“Huh… N-No, let’s not…”</p>
<p>“….Uuuuuuuu…”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san tightly embraced me, sobbing like a little animal.</p>
<p>… Whether she was granted permission or rejected, if she was planning to hug me anyway, why did she bother asking for permission…?</p>
<p>And so, for a little while, Tsumakawa-san clung to me…</p>

<p>This hug was a result of her seeking emotional stability, and it didn’t carry romantic implications.</p>
<p>Still, I felt ridiculously nervous despite this.</p>
<p>I’m a virgin, you know (just stating the fact).</p>

<p>Amidst all this, a few minutes passed… and I was finally released from her embrace.</p>
<p>After I told Tsumakawa-san, ‘Well then, I’ll try contacting home,’ I called my sister’s phone.</p>

<p>“Tonight, I want to have a female classmate stay over at our place. Is that okay…?”</p>
<p>『Ha?』</p>
<p>…After a discussion that ensued from there, I somehow managed to get permission from both my parents and my sister for the sleepover.</p>
<p>I turned back to Tsumakawa-san and noticed that she seemed to have been on the phone with someone at the same time.</p>
<p>She had her smartphone to her ear and let out a voice like this:</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s like a temporary runaway… Mmm, it’s okay. When I asked Yoda for help, Yoda said he’d help. If I get permission from his family, they’ll let me stay… Sorry. I didn’t mean it like that… Yeah, next I’ll ask Kanachamu… Hehe. I’m not in the mood for that today. I’m not even wearing my lucky underwear… Yeah, thanks for worrying. Love you. Yeah, I’ll do that…I was really happy to talk to you on the phone. Bye-bye.”</p>

<p>After ending the call, Tsumakawa-san’s expression became slightly relieved, and she noticed my gaze.</p>
<p>In response, she let out a small smile and pointed to her own smartphone.</p>

<p>“It’s Kanachamu. It seems my mom got in touch with her, and Kanachamu called me out of concern… But when I mentioned relying on Yoda, she scolded me, saying, ‘You should’ve asked me first.’ Usually, I’d definitely call Kanachamu first…but today, it was totally Yoda…”</p>
<p>My mom contacted me, and she called out of concern. When I mentioned asking Yoda for help, she scolded me, saying, ‘You should’ve asked Aishi first.’ Normally, I would’ve called Kanachiyamu first… but today, it was totally Yoda…”</p>
<p>“Don’t use my name like it’s a verb.”</p>

<p>While interjecting like that, I pondered for a bit… but yeah, that’s true, right?</p>
<p>Tsumakawa has plenty of other friends besides me, so why did she have to come to my house and risk getting rejected?</p>
<p>Why me?</p>

<p>With that question in mind, I ended up looking at her face.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa met my somewhat piercing gaze head-on and, with teary eyes, shyly smiled.</p>

<p>“Hmm, anyway, since I got permission to stay over… should we head to my house right now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Seriously, thanks…”</p>
<p>“And also, I realized from what my older sister said earlier… I think it’s better to at least let your mom know that you’re staying at my house. So, could you make a call?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true… By the way, Yoda, did you have an older sister?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. I have an annoyingly overprotective and irritating older sister…”</p>
<p>“Lucky you. I want siblings too…”</p>

<p>After that conversation, Tsumakawa-san promptly made a call to her mother.</p>
<p>…This girl is straightforwardly saying, ‘I’m staying at Yoda’s place tonight,’ but is that really okay?</p>
<p>If Tsumakawa’s dad finds out that she’s staying over at a male classmate’s house, won’t he explode in anger?</p>
<p>I hope Tsumakawa’s mom can be flexible about this whole situation…</p>


<p>About ten minutes after Tsumakawa was going to stay over at my place…</p>

<p>“Uh, s-sorry for the intrusion…”</p>

<p>I came back to my house with Tsumakawa after stopping at a convenience store on the way.</p>
<p>By the way, the current time is a little past 1 a.m.</p>
<p>So, we walked down the hallway trying not to make much noise, and I led her to the living room.</p>
<p>There, my older sister was waiting… then she stared at Tsumakawa with a surprised expression.</p>

<p>“W-Welcome… Uhh, she’s really beautiful, but… how do I put it? …I mean, I was expecting a girl who’s more, well, a better match for Ryo-kun to come…”</p>
<p>“Are you Yoda’s older sister? Nice to meet you. I’m Miona Tsumakawa. Gal Peace.”</p>
<p>“You’re not l, she still throws out the ‘peace’ sign naturally…”</p>
<p>“Even if you’re not feeling well, that gal peace naturally comes out, huh… This gal…”</p>

<p>Seeing Tsumakawa give a peace sign with a somewhat forced smile, I couldn’t help but interject.</p>
<p>Then, for some reason, my sister returned a peace sign to Tsumakawa and introduced herself.</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Asako,Ryo-kun’s older sister. I’m a third-year university student going through the hell of job hunting. Ane peace (Ane = Older sister).”</p>
<p>“What’s ‘Ane peace’? There’s no such weird ‘gal peace’ like that.”</p>
<p>“What’s weird about it? I think it’s cool, actually.”</p>
<p>“Cool? That phrase itself is already weird.”</p>
<p>“…You two seem close.”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s a bro-con, after all.”</p>
<p>“And you are a sis-con, Ryo-kun.”</p>
<p>“…are siblings usually this close…?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa tilted her head in confusion while asking with a shining look in her eyes.</p>
<p>Isn’t it quite normal for siblings to be close?</p>
<p>Could it be that our relationship is slightly creepy?</p>
<p>Wait, is there a possibility that we haven’t realized it’s creepy?</p>

<p>As I harbored such concerns, my sister picked up a set of pajamas from the sofa and handed it to Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>“These are my pajamas, you can use it. …but what about underwear?”</p>
<p>“I bought some panties from the convenience store, so I’m fine. Pajamas are totally enough.”</p>

<p>They’re whispering, but can’t they do it at a volume I can’t hear?</p>
<p>Then, my sister corrected our living arrangements and said to both of us.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed early since I have an early morning tomorrow… Ryo-kun’s room is next to mine, so please try to keep it quiet if you’re going to do anything, okay?”</p>
<p>“Just go to bed already, you ugl.”</p>
<p>“How dare you call your Onechan ugly? Ah, speaking of which, when Ryo-kun was a kid, he used to say he’d marry his Onēchan and give me a kiss on the cheek… He was so cute back then.”</p>
<p>“Seriously, just go to bed… Or else I’ll personally make sure Onēchan sleeps forever!”</p>

<p>Amidst my declarations, my sister laughed and said, ‘Then, goodnight, Ryo-kun. Tsumakawa-san, take it easy too,’ before leaving the living room.</p>
<p>…Honestly, why is it that family members are such embarrassingly awkward entities to show to others?</p>
<p>As I was pondering this, Tsumakawa, who noticed me blushing with embarrassment, smiled faintly and said,</p>

<p>“You’re quite a cheeky little brother… I wish I had a little brother like Yoda too…”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Isn’t that more like the flow of ‘I envy your Onēchan for having such a caring little brother like Yoda?’ “</p>

<p>After that retort, I took a seat on the sofa.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa, without much reservation, sat down on the same sofa next to me.</p>

<p>” ” …… ” “</p>

<p>After a while of silence, she turned to face me and asked,</p>

<p>“Hey, is it okay if I take a bath?”</p>
<p>“You’re feeling down, yet you’re pretty brazen, huh, gal?”</p>
<p>“Well, I haven’t even removed my makeup yet, and it’s kind of impossible to just go to sleep like this without taking a bath, right? So, I do think I’m a bit brazen, but I’m going to take a bath, okay?”</p>
<p>“You’re not exactly asking for permission, are you? …well, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ll come back after doing some laundry for my heart.”</p>
<p>“It’s rare to find a gal who knows that famous quote.”</p>
<p>“…don’t try to peek, okay?”</p>
<p>“Who do you think I am? I wouldn’t do that…”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t do that… Am I not attractive as a woman?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you being overly dramatic?”</p>

<p>At my retort, she, who seemed less energetic than usual, still managed a small smile.</p>
<p>I thought her ability to smile in moments like this was a testament to her strength.</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll borrow the bathroom.”</p>

<p>With just those words, Tsumakawa grabbed her bag and the pajamas she received from my sister and then headed for the changing room.</p>
<p>The sound of the sliding door opening and closing echoed——And amid those sounds, I heard the soft sound of clothes rustling.</p>
<p>In response, I hurriedly ran from the living room to my room to escape.</p>

<p>…Uhhh. The fact that a classmate, a girl, was using my house’s bathroom was just too stimulating for a high school boy!</p>
<p>With that in mind, I tried to find my earphones in my room to listen to music and block out the noise.</p>
<p>Oh right, I just threw away the pair I was using the day before yesterday because they broke!</p>

<p>How frustrating——no, how ironic!</p>
<p>Unable to plug my ears with music, the sound of the shower streamed into my eardrums——</p>

<p>Now, this is the time to count prime numbers!</p>
<p>Wait, how do you count prime numbers again? Um, prime numbers, prime numbers…</p>
<p>Actually, what are prime numbers in the first place?</p>

<p>At times like these, those in the humanities are truly powerless!</p>
<p>Unable to count prime numbers, I resorted to listing the names of literary giants in my head for about twenty minutes.</p>


<p>Suddenly, from the direction of the bathroom, a timid voice came.</p>

<p>“Uhm, Yoda…”</p>

<p>Upon hearing that, I cautiously turned my feet towards the changing room.</p>
<p>And so I arrived in the hallway just beyond the sliding door of the changing room, and from there, I inquired to her.</p>

<p>“Wh-what’s wrong…”</p>
<p>“Could you take my phone from my bag?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you do that yourself?”</p>
<p>“Well, sorry? But please?”</p>

<p>Being asked so earnestly, I couldn’t remain stubbornly resistant.</p>
<p>Thus, I entered the changing room, avoiding eye contact with the bathroom, and searched through Tsumakawa’s bag.</p>
<p>After finding what I was looking for, I took the flashy, vibrant smartphone that was sticking out of the white bag.</p>
<p>A little stunned, I then asked her.</p>

<p>“…Should I leave this in front of the bathroom door?”</p>
<p>“Um, please don’t put it on the floor. Can you… open it?”</p>
<p>“What? You want me to open it!?”</p>
<p>“Whoosh”</p>
<p>“Why are you trying to open the door while mentioning the sound of it…?”</p>

<p>As I pondered this, the door slowly creaked open.</p>
<p>Confirming this, I desperately averted my gaze as the door began to open, extending my left hand, which held the phone, towards the bathroom——</p>
<p>Soon, the door made a rattling noise as it opened completely.</p>
<p>I sensed someone very close to me. …If I even glanced a bit to the left, I could imagine seeing her naked.</p>
<p>That’s why I continued to face right with all my might.</p>

<p>Suppressing my inner desires, I put on a nerdy facade and mustered the strength to resist the urge to look at a girl’s naked body.</p>
<p>And so, the girl who was probably standing completely naked next to me took the phone from my hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“O-okay… then, c-can you go back to the bath quickly?”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Why are you just standing there in silence? If you’re done, hurry up and go back!”</p>

<p>While keeping my face turned to the right and standing stiffly, I yelled at her to go back to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Then, in the next moment – for some reason, Tsumakawa grasped my left wrist and, gently, and while holding it, said,</p>

<p>“Do you want to come in?”</p>
<p>“T-T-T-There’s no way I’m going in! Are you stupid?”</p>
<p>“… I see. I guess so…”</p>

<p>With a slightly disappointed voice, Tsumakawa let go of my wrist and quickly returned to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The door closed with a thud.</p>
<p>Wait, what was that exchange just now? What did those words mean?</p>

<p>Recalling the phrasing of a certain comedian while playing those words in my head, I staggered out of the changing room… Right now, just within my reach, was a naked Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>The fact caused me to feel mild dizziness.</p>
<p>It felt like a situation from an erotic manga introduction. No, that’s the worst analogy!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite falling into such a situation, the only thing I could possibly be proud of as a human being was my ability to maintain my virginity——my effort to avoid looking at her naked body.</p>

<p>“I apologize for asking something impossible. But… I just wanted you to be with me…”</p>

<p>I guess she was not in a mentally stable state at this moment.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to be one of those lowlifes who take advantage of a vulnerable Tsumakawa and look at her naked body, so…avoiding seeing her naked was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, there’s no need to regret it.</p>
<p>But actually…I wanted to see a naked woman!</p>

<p>Shouting such an ugly truth inside my head, I collapsed onto the sofa in the living room.</p>
<p>Then, immediately after that… from the bathroom, I heard a clicking sound and the sound of a smartphone shutter——what was Tsumakawa doing?</p>
<p>I was surprised. Then, those shutter sounds continued for a while——ten minutes later.</p>
<p>On my LINE, I suddenly received a photo from Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>When I checked it——</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g12.png" alt="" />

<p>“What?!! A lewd selfie? It’s a lewd selfie!”</p>

<p>It was a picture that seemed to have been taken in my bathroom ——a close-up image of Tsumakawa’s upper body, where she covered her nipples with her right arm while seemingly naked.</p>
<p>…Speaking frankly, this was by no means a nude photo.</p>
<p>The lower body wasn’t visible at all, and the important parts of her breasts were cleverly hidden.</p>
<p>It was more like a slightly provocative gravure photo.</p>

<p>However, the added value of it being taken in my bathroom and being a freshly taken photo was driving me towards intense excitement.</p>

<p>Is this gal trying to kill a virgin?!</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking that, I heard the bathroom door open with a creak.</p>
<p>After that, I heard the sound of a hair dryer and clothes rustling… and then, Tsumakawa, wrapped in my sister’s pajamas, emerged in our living room.</p>

<p>“H-hey, Tsumakawa… no, you lewd-girl. Why did you send me such a photo?”</p>
<p>“I mean, it was kind of meant as a thank you for letting me stay tonight. Did you like it?”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much——Wait, no! D-don’t take such lewd photos in someone else’s bathroom! It’s too explicit, it’s against the law…!”</p>
<p>“Ahaha. Your true feelings slipped out before your retort.”</p>

<p>With her face still red after her bath, she said that while sitting down next to me on the sofa.</p>


<p>Just having Tsumakawa sat down next to me on the sofa; the spot where my sister usually sits made my heart race uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Then, she placed her hands on her cheeks, glanced at me, and in a slightly embarrassed voice, she asked,</p>

<p>“…Is my bare face, like, bad? Am I ugly?”</p>
<p>“Bare face? Oh… The impression does change, but it’s not that different…”</p>
<p>“My bare face, am I cute?”</p>

<p>After removing her hands from her cheeks, Tsumakawa tilted her head cutely and asked me.</p>
<p>What’s with this conversation that sounds like something a new couple would have?</p>
<p>While trying to disguise my embarrassment by retorting about it, I managed to squeeze out these words.</p>

<p>“…Yeah. I mean… I think you’re cute, like, just like usual…”</p>
<p>“Really? I’m seriously putting effort into looking cute with makeup. If you think I’m cute without makeup, does that mean there’s no point in drawing my eyebrows?”</p>
<p>“I never imagined complimenting someone’s bare face would lead to them getting upset… Is talking to girls this difficult?”</p>
<p>“So, is this the time where we play a quiz about a maiden’s heart? Which one do you think is cuter, the Tsumakawa with makeup or the Tsumakawa without?”</p>
<p>“Uhh…? It’s kinda of hard to say… I guess if I had to, I’d say the makeup Tsumakawa looks cuter because the makeup enhances your cuteness…? …It’s better to just say something like that, right…?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s kind of hard to say… I guess if I had to, I’d say the made-up Tsumakawa looks cuter because the makeup enhances your cuteness… I mean, it’s better to just say something like that, right…?”</p>
<p>“Wrong answer! It’s not about that!”</p>
<p>“It’s not the correct answer?”</p>
<p>“For your information, the correct answer is—’I like Tsumakawa, so I find both the bare-faced Tsumakawa and the Tsumakawa with makeup cute. Furthermore, when you add that you’re studying and making an effort to look cute with makeup, I like you even more! You truly are a lovely girl, so keep it up!’ “</p>
<p>“Ugh, I’m not in the mood to understand all that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give up on making me feel good!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Tsumakawa lightly hit my shoulder and then chuckled softly, seemingly shy.</p>
<p>…After her bath, did she manage to cleanse her heart a little?</p>
<p>While I was pondering that, Tsumakawa suddenly pinched a strand of her hair and sniffed it.</p>
<p>While doing that, she gleamed and brought her face close to the back of my head, moving her nose like a dog.</p>
<p>What’s she doing? Did she sense my confusion?</p>
<p>Tsumakawa pulled her face away from my head and, still blushing, happily said,</p>

<p>“We smell the same.”</p>
<p>“Huh…? No way…”</p>
<p>“Yes, we do. Because I used Yoda’s shampoo.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>

<p>With an embarrassment I couldn’t quite grasp, my face turned redder.</p>
<p>In response, Tsumakawa laughed innocently like a mischievous child who had successfully pulled off a prank.</p>

<p>What is this…?</p>
<p>Tsumakawa, the cute model-like gal, using the cheap men’s shampoo that I use…</p>
<p>This feeling in my heart is too unsettling!</p>

<p>As I was panicking over that, Tsumakawa, who had done this without any regard for me, blushed slightly and playfully flapped her feet like a child, her bashfulness evident.</p>
<p>Then, she once again sniffed the ends of her hair and smiled, saying, ‘Yep, it smells like Yoda.’</p>
<p>…Well, it’s not my scent but the scent of men’s shampoo, you know!?</p>

<p>“If we both go to school tomorrow, will everyone notice that we have the same smell?”</p>
<p>“They, they won’t notice… Besides, tomorrow is Saturday, so we have no school…”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of nice that both Yoda and I have the same scent… Oh, that’s right. Next time, I’ll give Yoda the perfume I often use. How about we wear the same perfume and go to school together?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to do that! Plus, it’s not just gonna be like, ‘So, you two are dating?’ but more like, ‘That Yoda guy, did he research the perfume Tsumakawa-san uses and buy the same one?’ I can totally imagine that happening!”</p>
<p>“If that happens, I’ll go around and tell everyone. I’ll say, ‘This is the perfume I gave Yoda, so don’t get the wrong idea, everyone!’ “</p>
<p>“That would just lead to a different kind of misunderstanding…!”</p>

<p>After I pointed that out, Tsumakawa, who had turned back to a smile, started rummaging through a nearby bag.</p>
<p>Then, she took out the perfume that had been mentioned and applied it to her own wrist.</p>
<p>…She just got out of the bath, and now she’s applying perfume again?</p>
<p>As I was wondering about that, she suddenly said, ‘Take this!’ and lightly tapped my neck from the front——and began applying the perfume she had on her wrist to me.</p>
<p>What, what’s she doing, this gal!?</p>

<p>“Currently, it’s past 1:30 in the morning. I’m already in my pajamas, you know? I just need to sleep, so why are you randomly putting perfume on me…? Can you tell me the meaning behind this action?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Marking.”</p>
<p>“Don’t casually say such scary things!”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, she even got jealous when I helped out at Nakamachi’s part-time job.</p>
<p>Maybe Tsumakawa does have a strong possessive side in some aspects.</p>

<p>…Tsumakawa, who’s displaying this level of possessiveness toward someone like me, what will happen if she falls deeply in love with someone someday?</p>
<p>I can’t help but feel a little sorry for her potential partner. Poor him…</p>
