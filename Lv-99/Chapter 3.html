<h1 class="calibre3">3 - Chapter 3 - My Mind Is Screaming Something</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I got home, I noticed my father’s leather shoes in the foyer. It’s unusual for him to come home so early. I wonder if he finished the work he’s doing currently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I change into my slippers and adjust the pleats of my skirt before entering the living room. I brush my hair lightly and let out a small breath in order to calm myself down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m home. Father, you’re up early today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In the living room, Dad was sitting on the couch reading the newspaper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">His black-rimmed glasses were shining as if he was glaring at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi. How did it go?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Dad looks down at the newspaper again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Nothing special today. He’s been working in the staff room all morning, but I think he went out somewhere during his lunch break.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean…? Where did he go?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My father picks up on my fuzzy, muddled report.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The chime just rang and I couldn’t see where he was going. I left school right after class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Dad raised his glasses and got back to his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><b class="calibre13">(Investigation of the vice principal’s behavior) </b></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This was the job I had been given as an agent. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Ever since I entered high school, I have been monitoring the vice principal’s behavior on campus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The Kinoshita family has been agents for generations. There are many different kinds of work that an agent can do, but they mainly gather information and conduct </span><span class="calibre8">investigations at the request of organizations and individuals. That’s what I was told, and I don’t know much more other than that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Dad is an active agent and has had many accomplishments in the industry. It is rare for him to be home like this as he’s always traveling around the world for something or the </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…I see. Thank you for your efforts.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel pressured when my father, who is such a great agent, works with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I haven’t produced any results yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was humbled, but Dad was silent on this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not sure about the purpose of why I’m monitoring the vice principal. It was better that way though, as I try not to take my work personally. I only solemnly record the vice principal’s activities. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Well, I’m going back to my room.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes. I’ll rely on you for tomorrow as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I left the living room as it was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">That was not a usual family conversation.</span></i><span class="calibre8"> I always think that as I walk back to my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As the eldest daughter of the Kinoshita family, I will one day take over my father’s work in earnest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It can’t be helped that the topic of an agent’s work becomes the top priority in our family conversation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Sigh…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I enter my room, I exhale heavily, as if my tension had finally been released.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t hate my dad, but lately, I’m tired of feeling so pressured when talking about work. The stuffed bear on my desk was still tilted somewhat somberly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Trying to change my mood, I changed out of my uniform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put on a black hoodie over my bra top and a black jersey. I tie my hair into a ponytail with a black hair tie on my wrist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As an agent, I have come to prefer wearing black clothes. It has been imprinted on me ever since I was a child that I should be inconspicuous on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My sister always makes fun of me, saying that I look like a hitman of a dark organization, but she’s not wrong, so I can’t help it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced to the side and saw an expressionless, sullen face in the mirror on my desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is me, the ‘Agent’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I try not to show my emotions much when I think about work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s no wonder people are scared of me if I look this grumpy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I try to be alone at school so that I don’t interfere with any of the agents’ work. It’s better to be alone because I can move freely at any time then. It is more convenient for me to </span><span class="calibre8">be as shadowy and disinterested in my school life as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Although I’ve made my peace with it, it hurts me to ignore my classmates whenever they try to talk to me. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Today, too, I ignored Mayama-kun with all my might, and that was something that made everyone cringe. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Arghh</span></i><span class="calibre8">, no, no, no!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a slam, I collapse onto the bed and massage my face. I should stop thinking about work, at least whenever I’m alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I try to think of something fun, all I can think of is Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He knew my name when I saved him from falling down on the first day of school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He called me all of a sudden “Kinoshita-san,” so I got impatient and said, “I don’t know who you are.” </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">God, do I regret doing so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But since we’re a part of the same class, Satsuki-kun and I see each other very often. The fact that our eyes meet often means that he must be looking at me too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even today, when Mayama introduced himself to me, I was surprised when Satsuki-kun’s name came out suddenly. We bumped into each other in the hallway during lunch </span><span class="calibre8">break. I guess being in the same class brings us even closer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I close my eyes, I see Satsuki-kun’s image behind my eyelids.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know why he always looks so scared when he sees me. I wonder if he is surprisingly shy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still clearly remember the first time I met Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was half a year ago, on the day of the school festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-kun, you’re so cool,”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Ever since that day, I have been interested in Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Admiration? Respect? If I force myself to put it into words, is that what I feel like towards him?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Because Satsuki-kun has something I don’t have and because he does something I can’t do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We are now in the same class, and maybe one day we can go home together…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And then our eyes meet often, we laugh together, and we can communicate with each other without saying a thing…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I call him “Satsuki-kun” and he calls me “Yayoi-san” back…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel so sad to say bye-bye to him, so I kept waving at him until I couldn’t see him anymore and– (TLN: Two peas in a pod)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Already!? Oh, God!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel embarrassed when I fantasize about such a goofy development, akin to something like in a girl’s manga.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I sprawl out on the bed in a heap.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I lay face down on the pillow and called out his name to try it out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-kun….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I would never be able to say that name in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Going to school in the second year has become a little more enjoyable. That’s because I can </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">see Satsuki-kun every day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to talk with him more and know even more about him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wish I could see Satsuki-kun tomorrow as much as I wish it would be sunny tomorrow as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My school life has been pretty silent so far. No one could try to talk to me and I had to cover my ears whenever they did so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had been living in a soundless world, completely shut out from my surroundings, but after meeting Satsuki-kun, there’s a strange sound coming from my heart that I have never heard before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s like my heart is screaming something, that kind of sound is…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I notice that I’m having feelings that I never knew I had before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But this is just an ideal. A convenient fantasy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I look up from my pillow and reality envelops me once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Agent Yayoi Kinoshita.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am an agent before a high school girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s been half a year since I met Satsuki-kun, and now that we are in the same class, the physical distance between us has shortened quite a bit. But in reality, the distance between us has only remained further and further apart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s a wall between an ideal and reality.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I have always given up something in my life in order to be an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve been holding back what I wanted to do for so long that I don’t even know </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">what</span></i><span class="calibre8"> I want to do anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember my face which was frozen like ice in the mirror earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I wasn’t an agent, could I have laughed more normally, done what I wanted, and been a normal high school girl…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ll pretend that’s not a regret or a worry, but just my usual delusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Only the warmth of Satsuki-kun’s left hand that I suddenly touched softly came back to me. (TLN: NO! That’s lewd1)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want anyone to know about this warmth, I don’t want it to disappear from me. I clenched my hand tightly and buried my face in the pillow again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was nothing I could do, but I hoped that tomorrow I would be able to get a little closer to him.</span></p>
