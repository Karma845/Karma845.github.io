<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 13 - This Is The Way I Live</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I came home, my mother was cleaning up as it was past lunchtime. She gave me a startled look and said, “You’re home early,” but I didn’t want her to worry, so I told her “It was planned.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even though it was a date, I came back in the afternoon and it wasn’t on par with my schedule.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mom was going to be gone for a while in the afternoon to be an agent, so she didn’t pursue the matter any further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seems that Uzuki was visiting a friend’s house for the time being, and dad hasn’t come home from work yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I walked past her and went back to my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took off the clothes I borrowed from my mom. I was happy that Satsuki-kun said they looked good on me. Although, I wanted to wear the clothes I picked out </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">myself </span></i><span class="calibre8">next time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Maybe next time…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I arrived two hours early for the date, but for some reason, Satsuki-kun was already there. I was nervous and so I left early, but Satsuki-kun was in a worse condition than me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so nervous that I couldn’t say anything the whole time. I could think of things inside my head, but I couldn’t put any of those thoughts into words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was trying to do my best until recently, but when I actually saw Satsuki-kun in front of me, I couldn’t move my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried not to make eye contact with him so that I wouldn’t glare at him at least, but then that meant I couldn’t interact with him at all. I didn’t say anything either, so Satsuki-kun got concerned and proposed we go home early…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s right. If I was that unsociable, Satsuki-kun would be in trouble too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I didn’t want to leave like this, so I tried my best to smile back at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t resist blushing back then, but I was so embarrassed that Satsuki-kun was staring at my face, you know?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I was glad that he understood that I hadn’t been glaring at him purposefully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After that, the misunderstanding had been cleared up and I could finally talk to Satsuki-kun for a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">…But, I met my dad soon after that, and things got weird again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know why my father was there in the first place. I don’t want to think that he was following me so early in the morning, but it’s not impossible either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s because I’m an agent and I’m in a position to take over the Kinoshita family’s business. They might think that dating a boy is out of the question for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I met my father, the mood of the date was completely blown away, and I faced reality immediately at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After all, reality does not simply just disappear. You can’t hide from reality with a dream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am an agent. This is how I should live.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m glad I could be a normal high school girl for one day, and I’m grateful to Satsuki-kun for that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Tomorrow, I’ll be an agent again, just as usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There are some things that can’t end like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So far I’ve only been thinking about myself. I’ve put up with a lot of things just because I’m an agent, like being alone at school and everything. That just made the class atmosphere worse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun was such an awkward person in the class, yet he approached me and asked me out on a date…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He did all of this for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So I at least wanted today’s date to go well. I don’t care about my job as an agent or my father, because they are none of Satsuki-kun’s business…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But in the end, I said something very selfishly without thinking about Satsuki-kun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I asked him to play the piano for me…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Satsuki-kun, you said that you forgot the sheet music, but that was probably a lie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When you tried to play the piano, your hands were shaking. Your breathing was getting worse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">He can’t play the piano anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reason must be because of his mistakes at the school festival. He might have been traumatized by that event.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without realizing it, I insensitively tried to get him to play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I was the only one who was troubled, but Satsuki-kun was hiding various things together as well…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to see Satsuki-kun troubled anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want him to be able to play the piano again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now it’s my turn to return the favor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What can I do for him?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I look at the closet in my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After last year’s festival, I actually found something I wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The pieces of that wish are now tucked away somewhere inside the closet. I couldn’t say I wanted to do it back then, so I gave up on it like I always do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For the first time in six months, I pulled it out of the closet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If I show him what I really want to do, I wonder if Satsuki will have the courage to do it. Will he be able to play the piano again?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When we went on our date, I wished time would stay like this forever, but that wouldn’t help me move forward. I have to step forward for you, Satsuki.-kun</span> <span class="calibre8">I can’t quit my job, my future may be set, but I don’t want to give this feeling I have to anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can no longer ignore this gentle sound thumping in the back of my heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This time I want to be there for you, Satsuki-kun!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s how I can repay Satsuki-kun for making my wish come true.</span></p>
