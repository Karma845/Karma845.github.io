<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 13: Gal and Breakfast</h1>


<p>After I had fallen asleep in the tatami room, a few hours had passed.</p>
<p>Slowly emerging from a deep slumber, I heard a voice from nearby as I tried to open my eyes.</p>

<p>” …I want to do it one more time… “</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you wake up——good morning, onīchan! Seriously, you overslept by a ton! How long are you going to sleep? It’s already 11 AM!”</p>
<p>“…A stereotypical little sister… This is the situation that every light novel reader dreams of. Getting woken up by a stereotypical little sister… I did it…”</p>

<p>Struggling against drowsiness, as I pushed my eyelids open, Tsumakawa’s face was right in front of me.</p>
<p>In my half-asleep state, I blurted out that impression.</p>
<p>Then, for some reason, she blushed deeply and quickly got up.</p>

<p>“…Good morning, Yoda. I made breakfast, so let’s eat together.”</p>
<p>“Yawn… Good morning, Tsumakawa-san… Breakfast? You made it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. How about you wash your face and wake up? Then come to the living room.”</p>
<p>“In case you’re wondering, this is my house… Don’t talk as if it’s your house… “</p>
<p>“The bathroom is just down the hallway from the living room. If you don’t know where it is, just ask.”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to get an explanation of my own house from you?”</p>

<p>After I retorted like that, rubbing my sleepy eyes, I got up and headed to the bathroom with unsteady steps.</p>
<p>I turned on the tap, let warm water flow, washed my face, and couldn’t help being surprised at the unusual morning situation of being woken up by a female classmate.</p>
<p>If I strained my ears, I could hear birds chirping in the distance.</p>
<p>Ah, so this is the rumored morning ‘chirp’.</p>
<p>Does that mean I’m not a virgin anymore? Awesome.</p>

<p>With such thoughts in mind, I (still a virgin) returned to the living room, and there, in the kitchen of my house, was Tsumakawa-san, wearing an apron over yesterday’s casual clothes and having already finished her makeup.</p>

<p>“Uh, what are you doing in someone else’s kitchen?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wanted to make breakfast! Since it’s a rare occasion, I thought you might want to try Miona’s homemade cooking. So, I went to the supermarket a while ago and bought the ingredients. It’ll be ready soon, so just sit and wait.”</p>
<p>“Breakfast… It’s already past 11 AM, isn’t it? Can you still call this meal breakfast?”</p>
<p>“Oh right, then it’s brunch. ——Soon, ‘Brunch a.k.a Breakfast’ will be ready, so look forward to it!”</p>
<p>“Brunch, also known as breakfast. Isn’t that still a breakfast?”</p>

<p>While I retorted like that, I took a seat in one of the chairs arranged around the square table.</p>
<p>Looking towards the kitchen, I could see Tsumakawa-san chopping vegetables like lettuce and tomatoes on the cutting board.</p>
<p>…She had once tried to make nikujaga but ended up making miso soup. I wonder if she’ll be fine this time…</p>

<p>“By the way, Yoda, your parents left as soon as I woke up, and your older sister wasn’t here when I woke up, so it seems like it’s just you and me at home.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“…You can cook, right?”</p>
<p>“… We can do naughty things, huh?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask that!?”</p>

<p>With my retort, Tsumakawa-san chuckled.</p>
<p>Chop- chop-chop- While maintaining a steady rhythm with her knife, she continued, keeping her eyes on the tomato she was slicing.</p>

<p>“Hey, sorry about yesterday. I made you listen to my complaints for so long… If you felt like it, you could have left me behind somewhere in the middle…”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s fine… You don’t need to apologize for that. After all, I was the one who said I would listen to your complaints as much as you wanted. But, well, it did go on for quite a while.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, right? I think we talked till morning. Tsumakawa can be quite a pain.”</p>
<p>“Um, Tsumakawa-san? Those were my lines, you know? If you knew you were being a pain, why didn’t you stop sooner?”</p>
<p>“…Well, if we stopped talking, I thought you might go somewhere…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Of course, the main reason is that there was so much I wanted to talk to Yoda about. …I see. I just apologized now, but it’s not ‘I’m sorry.’ Instead, thank you for yesterday, Yoda.”</p>
<p>“…Well, it was this morning, not yesterday…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha. Can’t you even say ‘You’re welcome’ sincerely?”</p>

<p>Seeing me with a stubborn reaction, Tsumakawa-san laughed happily.</p>
<p>In response, all I could do was turn down my reddening face.</p>
<p>With such twisted remarks, I ended up feeling even more embarrassed.</p>

<p>While I was lost in thought, watching Tsumakawa’s actions, she transferred the cut vegetables onto a plate and then began to cut the bread. It seemed she was making sandwiches.</p>
<p>While she cut off the crust from the bread, in the casual tone of everyday conversation, like when talking about today’s weather, she said,</p>

<p>“Dad sent me a message earlier… He apologized and said he went too far. Since he sincerely apologized, I’ve decided to stop my mini-runaway and go home after breakfast.”</p>
<p>“…I see. That’s good.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, it hasn’t really solved anything… But well, there’s no other choice but to keep going like this. It’s annoying how my dad is, but I still have to try to understand and communicate with him, even if he finds me annoying… And I’ll continue to work hard with Yoda and Kanachamu supporting me. So, for now, I’ll head home later…”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s a good idea.”</p>

<p>As I smiled like that, Tsumakawa-san looked at me and said, ‘Don’t make that kind of face. It’s making me embarrassed…’ blushing and then turning her red face away.</p>
<p>…Huh? Did I just have a face that made Tsumakawa shy?</p>

<p>As I pondered that question, she continued her story, seemingly regaining her composure.</p>

<p>“That’s why, with this, my fifth mini-runaway has come to an end!”</p>
<p>“…Huh, the fifth time!? Tsumakawa-san, you’ve done this five times already!?”</p>
<p>“Huh, didn’t I mention it? About once every six months or so, I do a mini-runaway and stay over at a friend’s house. Until now, I’ve always stayed at Kanachamu’s place, but this is the first time I’ve asked a boy for help. Ehehe…”</p>
<p>“…If it wasn’t a serious escape, should I have not let you stay…?”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s the fifth time, it’s always serious to me! Don’t make me regret it!”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t have any regrets, but… couldn’t you have managed without me letting you stay?”</p>
<p>“…Yoda, that’s so mean… How could you say something like that…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sorry. I sincerely apologize, but please don’t approach me while holding the knife. It’s a bit too scary!”</p>
<p>“I don’t need an Onīchan who doesn’t like me!”</p>
<p>“Don’t suddenly turn into a yandere little sister! In reality, that kind of thing has absolutely no elements that make people go ‘cute.’ “</p>
<p>“I’ll fillet you beautifully…”</p>
<p>“Why are you doing it the same way as a fish!? Are you planning to turn me into sushi?”</p>
<p>“I’ll cut, sear, turn you into sashimi, and dip you in wasabi soy sauce…”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to enjoy eating me as much as possible… Besides, humans can’t be filleted like fish!”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll skin you!”</p>
<p>“That would be extremely painful!”</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, seemingly satisfied after a series of jokes, Tsumakawa-san laughed merrily and then said, ‘You shouldn’t anger me while I’m holding a knife, okay?’</p>
<p>With that, she returned to the kitchen. That parting line was way too ominous…</p>


<p>Afterward, she placed the knife in the sink, then exclaimed, ‘Place the bread, go!’ in a minuscule imitation, and proceeded to assemble the ingredients between the bread slices, completing the sandwich.</p>

<p>Holding a plate with a multitude of sandwiches, she came over to the living room table.</p>
<p>In the center of the table, she placed the large plate of sandwiches with a thud. She then sat down in the seat next to me and, with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s eat together!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah, but… Isn’t this a bit too much?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Isn’t this normal? Can’t you finish this much?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“What, why are you acting like Miona is some greedy monster eating these? I obviously made these expecting Yoda to eat a lot… If you eat fewer sandwiches than I do, I won’t forgive you, okay?”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to experience this much tension during breakfast…”</p>
<p>“Oh, only for breakfast? You don’t want to ‘taste’ the tension? That’s clever.”</p>
<p>“It just came out by accident. It’s not that clever, so you don’t have to point it out.”</p>
<p>(TN: Here, the pun is on “味わう” which can mean both ‘to taste’ and ‘to experience’.)</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, I gazed at the massive number of sandwiches on the large plate.</p>
<p>Could this place be some kind of sandwich shop? I should ask for an interview!</p>

<p>Just as I thought that Tsumakawa said, ‘Itadakimasu,’ and brought her hands together.</p>
<p>I echoed with the same ‘Itadakimasu and clasped my hands together.</p>

<p>Then, picking up a BLT sandwich placed in front of me, I took a bite.</p>
<p>It wasn’t particularly shockingly delicious… Yet, maybe because I had seen her making them, this simple sandwich strangely tasted quite good.</p>
<p>Seeing me eat with delight, Tsumakawa-san smiled happily.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, feeling embarrassed from being watched, I stuffed the BLT sandwich into my mouth, almost as if pushing it forcefully.</p>
<p>After watching me finish the first one, Tsumakawa-san took a bite of her egg sandwich.</p>
<p>Instantly, her expression bloomed into a smile. She then proceeded to eat her egg sandwich eagerly and sighed contentedly, saying, ‘Aah…’</p>

<p>Observing that, I thought to myself… girls who eat delicious food with such satisfaction are very nice.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter, but I don’t know why I’m thinking about that.</p>

<p>As we continued eating the sandwiches for a while, both of us reached for sandwiches at the same time—and our hands accidentally touched.</p>
<p>Wow…did I just do something out of a cliché romantic comedy…? I thought, but even I didn’t get flustered from this level of physical contact.</p>
<p>But then, ‘Kya!’ Tsumakawa-san let out an uncharacteristically cute scream and quickly withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>Surprised, I looked at her, and there she was, holding her hand that touched my right hand to her chest, blushing and looking embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Huh? Tsumakawa-san…?”</p>
<p>“Ah? ….I-It’s nothing? I-I didn’t, like, get startled or anything?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I guess… but Tsumakawa-san, up until now, you’ve touched my hand casually without my permission… But your reaction just now, what was that about?”</p>
<p>” Ahaha… Maybe because it was an accident? It’s not that my heart skipped a beat because I touched Yoda’s hand, but for some reason, it really raced… I wonder why… “</p>
<p>” Isn’t your Japanese a bit off? “</p>

<p>I pointed out the contradiction in her words, but she responded with, ‘Huh? it’s not strange, is it? Just straightforward feelings,’ leaving me puzzled.</p>
<p>What is she talking about? With a question mark floating over my head due to Tsumakawa’s statement, she then picked up another tuna sandwich, taking bites as she asked me,</p>

<p>“Yoda, don’t you get excited?”</p>
<p>“Huh… You mean when my hand touched yours, Tsumakawa-san?”</p>
<p>“Not just that. I do touch your body quite a bit, don’t I? Aren’t you getting excited? If you’re not getting excited, that’s kind of shocking, you know? Like, I thought maybe I’m not that attractive…”</p>
<p>“W-Well, that’s… I do get excited and nervous…”</p>
<p>“Really?… Ah, thank you…”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying ‘thank you’?”</p>

<p>I retorted as Tsumakawa-san bashfully averted her gaze.</p>
<p>…In a way, her behavior was quite strange.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tsumakawa-san was clearly not feeling well, which was normal if she differed from her usual self.</p>
<p>But today, she seemed a bit off again, appearing more modest than usual…</p>

<p>“Actually, speaking of Tsumakawa-san’s physical touch, the truth is… I’d prefer it if you stopped… Even if I know there’s no deep meaning to it, for an introverted guy like me, it’s just too stimulating…”</p>
<p>“I see… So my body touch does make you feel excited… I got it! Well then, I’ll keep doing body touches to Yoda from now on! Look forward to it!”</p>
<p>“What did you understand? I said you should stop with the body touches.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m not particularly fond of body touches either way… But if that makes Yoda like me, I’ll try my best with the body touches! Stay tuned!”</p>
<p>“If you’re not particularly fond of it, why bother trying so hard with the body touches? You can stop it if you want.”</p>

<p>Even as I said this, Tsumakawa continued nibbling on her tuna sandwich, just smiling and having fun.</p>
<p>——It would be nice if there were words like ‘persuading a ga;’ in the same sense as ‘water off a duck’s back’ or ‘like preaching to the wind’</p>

<p>After the conversation settled down, we resumed the task of reducing the sandwiches on the large plate.</p>

<p>“Which sandwich do you like the most, Yoda?”</p>
<p>“I guess I like the egg sandwich…”</p>
<p>“Right?! Egg sandwiches are yummy! By the way, I love yakiniku the most!”</p>
<p>“Which sandwich do you like? That was the question. Where did the limitation to sandwiches go?”</p>
<p>“Since when have you been under the illusion that it was limited to sandwiches?”</p>
<p>“Stop with the sudden Aizen Sosuke references.”</p>

<p>While having this kind of utterly trivial conversation, Tsumakawa and I continued eating our slightly delayed breakfast quietly together.</p>


<p>Around ten minutes had passed…</p>
<p>As I started to feel a bit full from the sandwiches and was biting into my egg sandwich, Tsumakawa, who was finishing up her BLT sandwich, asked me,</p>

<p>“Yoda, do you watch movies?”</p>
<p>“Movies? Well, I watch them sometimes… I guess I watch more than most high school students.”</p>
<p>“I see. I don’t watch movies much… But there was something written in a light novel that said, ‘In movies, a scene where a man and a woman share a meal is a metaphor for s*x.’ Did you know that, Yoda?”</p>
<p>“N-no.. Is that so…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, apparently. So, here’s my question… What are we doing right now?”</p>

<p>As she said that, she picked up another tuna sandwich from the large plate.</p>

<p>I had just finished my egg sandwich that was within arm’s reach, and I was debating whether to eat the next one and the sandwiches on the large plate had significantly diminished, leaving only two.</p>
<p>As Tsumakawa and I continued our insignificant conversation, we managed to eat our abundant breakfast up to this point.</p>
<p>After confirming that, Tsumakawa-san asks, ‘What are we doing right now?’ with a somewhat ambiguous expression.</p>

<p>“…Eating sandwiches…”</p>
<p>“Hmm, be more precise. Not that, I mean… We’re eating breakfast together, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Eating meals together in the morning is pretty suggestive, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>” We’re just eating breakfast together, why does it have to be like that!? “</p>
<p>“Even having dinner together can be kinda suggestive, so doing it in the morning is just too much.”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Tsumakawa-san. ——Right now, we’re just eating sandwiches together! There’s absolutely nothing suggestive about it! “</p>

<p>As I retorted, Tsumakawa smiled satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Did Tsumakawa-san go through the trouble of making a large number of sandwiches just to convey this point? I wondered.</p>
<p>As I questioned this, she continued her words while bashfully avoiding my gaze.</p>
<p>Her cheeks, turned away somewhat shyly, were redder than ripe apples… and that’s why I couldn’t take my eyes off her profile.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Even though you talk about metaphors for s*x, in the end, we’re just having a meal together. But, Yoda… I wanted to… “</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“I wanted to eat breakfast with you… That’s how I feel… “</p>
<p>” …………… “</p>

<p>While saying this, Tsumakawa took a bite of her tuna sandwich.</p>
<p>Even though she’s just having breakfast like before, in my eyes, it seemed like a seductive act——</p>
<p>She licks her lips with the tip of her tongue to remove the tuna that’s stuck there.</p>
<p>With her moistened lips, she takes another bite, munching softly as she takes a small bite from the large tuna sandwich.</p>

<p>A deliberate, savoring chew.</p>
<p>The sound of teeth gently clashing echoed. Then, after enjoying the tuna sandwich meticulously, she mischievously smiled and lightly traced her lips with her index finger.</p>
<p>Her glossy pink lips, captivating, stole my attention… In an instant, my heart began to race for an unidentifiable reason.</p>
<p>Even though we hadn’t done anything even remotely suggestive, how did Tsumakawa-san eating a sandwich suddenly look so provocative to me?</p>

<p>As I trembled in such thoughts, she suddenly held out the half-eaten tuna sandwich she had taken two bites from toward me.</p>

<p>“I’m full now. Would you like to finish it?”</p>

<p>She said. The sandwich, with Tsumakawa-san’s clear bite marks, was presented right in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>I was puzzled, but I somehow managed to respond weakly.</p>

<p>“N-No, Tsumakawa-san… that’s your half-eaten sandwich…”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to eat it? I see… Well then, I guess I’ll have to throw it away…”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“I made this sandwich for you because I wanted to eat breakfast together with you, Yoda… But you’re refusing it. So, I guess there’s nothing else I can do but throw it away…ugh, there’s nothing else I can do but… to throw it away…”</p>
<p>“O-Okay! Enough, I’ll eat it! I’ll eat it…”</p>

<p>Facing Tsumakawa, who looked like she was about to burst into tears, I reflexively blurted out those words.</p>
<p>Then, with an innocent smile, she offered the half-eaten tuna sandwich to me.</p>

<p>… I folded the sandwich in half to hide the part with Tsumakawa-san’s bite marks on the inside, then folded it again.</p>
<p>After compacting it as much as I could, I pushed the compressed tuna sandwich into my mouth and chewed it hastily.</p>
<p>In an instant, the flavor of the tuna sandwich spread throughout my mouth, but I don’t care!</p>
<p>I did my best to swallow the sandwich, focusing on the fact that it was Tsumakawa-san’s half-eaten sandwich.</p>

<p>Then she looked at me with a feverish expression, smiling gently.</p>

<p>“Did you eat it?”</p>
<p>“Hey, what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just that I’m happy you ate it… That’s all. …I’m just feeling happy on my own, so don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>After saying this, Tsumakawa corrected her posture and looked at me.</p>
<p>Then, with her cheeks still slightly flushed, she couldn’t contain her smile and continued while taking a BLT sandwich from the large plate.</p>
<p>‘No, weren’t you full already?’</p>

<p>“Honestly, I didn’t expect it to turn out like this… I do like Nezumayo-kun, and that’s why I became interested in Yoda, but I didn’t expect it to turn out like this——I never thought that Ryosuke Yoda, a guy, could make me feel like this… “</p>
<p>“T-Tsumakawa-san…?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really understand what this was all about before… Maybe I just wasn’t trying to see it. But… my feelings have solidified.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Hey, Yoda. Can I rephrase what I said?”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, my body tensed up. Finally, I managed to meet her gaze again.</p>
<p>I didn’t exactly know what she was going to say, but I just wanted her to stop.</p>
<p>I had started to want her to acknowledge my presence, but if she says that now, I might want to distance myself from her again…</p>

<p>As I harbored these feelings, Tsumakawa-san started eating the BLT sandwich in her hand without a word.</p>
<p>After a while, she finished eating the sandwich with a resolute expression, took a breath, and turned toward me once more.</p>
<p>She opened and closed her mouth nervously, revealing her tension. She swallowed her saliva with a gulp and nervously hugged herself.</p>
<p>‘Why am I so nervous, me…’ she muttered to herself, and then she looked at me again.</p>
<p>And then, with sincerity in her eyes, her expression devoid of casualness and her voice trembling, she told me,</p>

<p>“Uh, um, Yoda… Yoda-kun! I, I… I want… want to be… to be——”</p>

<p>…However, no matter how much time passed, the next words didn’t come out.</p>

<p>When I looked back at her, our eyes met.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Tsumakawa, locking eyes with me, turned even redder, then covered her face with both hands and lowered her head in embarrassment.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g14.png" alt="" />

<p>“Uh… Uhh?”</p>

<p>Seeing this uncommonly speechless Tsumakawa, I was left dumbfounded. And so, a long silence fell between us.</p>
<p>Since she wasn’t saying anything, I couldn’t say anything either… Then, after a while, Tsumakawa slowly raised her head that had been bowed.</p>

<p>“Sniff… Uh… Y-Yoda… I-I…”</p>

<p>She was crying, tears streaming down from her eyes.</p>
<p>It was like she was crying because she didn’t know how to handle the emotions she was feeling, just like a child.</p>
<p>Seeing her like that, I instinctively reached for the last sandwich left on the large plate for some reason.</p>
<p>Then, in a hurry, I offered it to Tsumakawa, who was sitting next to me.</p>

<p>“H-Here you go…”</p>
<p>“Uuu… Th-thank you…”</p>

<p>When she took the egg sandwich from me, Tsumakawa began eating her self-made sandwich while still crying.</p>
<p>I didn’t really understand why I took such an action. But maybe I just wanted Tsumakawa to feel a bit better.</p>
<p>However, with so little I could do when I had nothing, all I could do was this ineffective gesture.</p>

<p>To give the last sandwich on the plate to a girl to stop her tears was such a virgin move… I felt ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>However, after Tsumakawa finished eating the egg sandwich and wiped her tears away with her hand, she let out a small laugh while rubbing her eyes, her makeup slightly smudged.</p>
<p>Her expression wasn’t lively, but her voice sounded more cheerful than I had anticipated.</p>

<p>“For now, I don’t need to rephrase it… I’ve realized my feelings for myself, so that’s enough. It’s not really like me…I’ve realized it’s not really like me, but that’s fine…”</p>


<p>“For now, I don’t need to rephrase it… I’ve realized my feelings for myself, so that’s enough. It’s not really like me…I’ve realized it’s not really like me, but that’s fine…”</p>

<p>After uttering these self-reassuring words, she looked at me.</p>
<p>Although her tears had stopped, Tsumakawa still had moist eyes and spoke again,</p>

<p>“Um, so… what was it that I wanted to say?”</p>
<p>“Something like that, only Tsumakawa-san would know, right?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I guess. Um… so, in other words… it’s just that when I’m feeling down, thanks for being kind to me. That’s all!”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see… That’s what you wanted to say…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, exactly! From now on, I’ll come to stay over more often, so make sure you have a special futon for me or something in your room!”</p>
<p>“Geez, you gal, seriously… This is a one-time thing. I won’t allow this kind of thing in the future, you know?”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe I’ll leave something behind at Yoda’s place next time. Then, I can use going back to get it as an excuse to come to Yoda’s place again. I wonder what I should ‘accidentally’ forget…?”</p>
<p>“You’re quite the schemer… I’ll have to thoroughly keep an eye on you to make sure you don’t leave anything behind!”</p>
<p>“Maybe I should leave my shorts behind. If I do that, I don’t think Yoda will dare to touch them.”</p>
<p>“Spare me. Please remember to take everything back with you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, by the way, ‘ショーツ(shōtsu)’ refers to panties, women’s underwear. I’m wearing the pink ones with ribbons.”</p>
<p>“I already knew that, so you didn’t need to explain. But did you really need to disclose the specific information about the panties you’re wearing right now?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I thought Yoda would be happy to know.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I’m not happy about it, you idiot!”</p>
<p>“Yet you’re saying that with a huge grin on your face, huh?”</p>

<p>With those words, Tsumakawa lightly hit my shoulder.</p>
<p>…It’s good that the atmosphere has become relaxed.</p>
<p>Even though I wasn’t really happy to hear that, it was worth it to smile after hearing Tsumakawa’s panties information…</p>
<p>——I smiled on purpose just to get her to smack me, okay? I swear!</p>

<p>As I was coming up with these excuses in my head, Tsumakawa showed a bright smile for the first time in a while and asked me,</p>

<p>“Will you stay with me from now on?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, that is, um… I won’t reject being together for no reason…”</p>
<p>“Ah, I phrased it wrong. ——I’ll be with you from now on, so please take care of me!”</p>
<p>“Being together is a done deal, huh…”</p>

<p>When I retorted with a puzzled look, Tsumakawa smiled while looking at me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as I saw her smiling face, at the same time, I found myself thinking about various things——</p>
<p>『Uh, um, Yoda… Yoda-kun! I, I… I want… want to be… to be——』</p>

<p>When Tsumakawa started saying that, I once again thought, ‘Stop, please.’ It’s not because I dislike her… It’s because I like her.</p>
<p>At that moment, when Tsumakawa said that with different, more genuine emotions than before, I might have ended up making a choice that I would regret.</p>
<p>Whether I accepted or declined, either way might have led to regrets.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t want to accept. …Because I haven’t developed those kinds of feelings yet.</p>
<p>Moreover, I don’t think I even have the qualifications to accept.</p>
<p>That’s why I didn’t think this would happen… But precisely because of that, I became afraid of turning down her offer and losing everything.</p>

<p>If Tsumakawa said that to me right now, our current relationship would probably come to an end.</p>
<p>Fearful of that, I found myself thinking, ‘I don’t want that’</p>
<p>…because, somehow, I realized that I actually find this situation of being with Tsumakawa enjoyable.</p>
<p>Not wanting to lose this relationship…is that the reason why I’m feeling this way?</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t stare too much… My makeup’s a mess, and I’m looking ugly. If you’re going to look, wouldn’t it be better to look at me when my makeup’s still intact?”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not like… I’m looking at Tsumakawa-san or anything…”</p>

<p>Saying this, I hastily averted my gaze from Tsumakawa…I could feel my cheeks getting warm.</p>
<p>I remembered my past self, the one who used to say he wouldn’t trust 3D girls.</p>
<p>——When did I become like this?</p>

<p>I still think I can’t become friends with a gal like Tsumakawa, but…</p>
<p>I can’t believe that I’m afraid of not being with her anymore.</p>

<p>As a genuine otaku, I should always have my AT Field (Absolute Terror Field) up around my heart.</p>
<p>However, she somehow managed to get inside…and before I knew it, she was a part of my life.</p>
<p>…I realized that I had started watching the official YouTube channel of 『leg』 the agency she was affiliated with as a model. Or I would read the magazine she gave me occasionally.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been checking my phone a lot to make sure I don’t ignore messages on LINE. Ultimately, I… I like Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>Not in a romantic way. Not as a friend…but as a person.</p>
<p>She’s a nice person who’s kind to even someone like me, and I felt good about being with Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>——I, I don’t know if ‘like’ is the right word. But I guess I found her to be likeable.</p>

<p>So, when she seemed like she was about to confess her feelings to me, I got scared.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to reject her and lose this connection, and I couldn’t confidently say that I liked her enough to accept it, so I became afraid of hearing that from Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to sort out these feelings of mine!</p>

<p>While screaming that internally, I stole a glance at her face.</p>
<p>For now… I can’t be honest with her, but one thing is for sure: I do think of Tsumakawa-san in a positive light.</p>
<p>At the very least, I have to tell her how I honestly felt about the breakfast I had with her.</p>

<p>“Thank you for making the meal… The sandwich was delicious.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, you finally said it. It’s about time you spoke up.”</p>

<p>As if she had been waiting for those words from me, Tsumakawa-san said that with a smile.</p>
<p>Witnessing her radiant smile, I felt like I understood a little bit about what she often refers to as ‘like’ but not ‘love’.</p>
