<<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 16 - Satsuki-kun and Yayoi-chan</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we entered our second year, April was coming to an end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As the season began to change from spring to summer, another change also occurred within our class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s absence was over in just three days, and the day after I visited her, she came to school just as usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That ‘stay away from me’ aura seemed to have faded, and she no longer ignored her classmates when they spoke to her, she instead began to smile and converse with them like a normal student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This was soon spread throughout the entire school and was even rumored to be known as the “Strange Incident of Class 7, Year 2”. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s sure to become one of the most significant incidents in the history of Otomachi High School. Yayoi-chan is always so full of rumors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even Mayama had said to me, “Maybe it’s because of that date with you, don’t you think so?” But I just calmly laughed at his words. I wanted to tell him that it wasn’t just that, but that piano date was a secret between the two of us. Yes, it’s a memory that only the two of us will have.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Another thing that changed was that we switched seats in class. I ended up in the frontmost seat right by the window, so I couldn’t look at the back of Yayoi-chan’s head during </span><span class="calibre8">class anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I guess that’s okay. When I casually looked back at Yayoi-chan from time to time, she raised her eyebrows as if she was going to glare at me, but the very next moment she would just smile back at me. Her smile was still awkward, like a cat when it had been caught doing something red-handed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to use the opportunity to ask her out on a second date during Golden Week, but unlike last time, I didn’t have a chance to ask her out, so I was holding back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I asked her out once, so it should be easy. Because Yayoi-chan thinks I’m cool, right?” I was conflicted between the aggressive me and the reserved me, “Even in the midst of friendship, there is etiquette. I am a reserved person, be modest and don’t be conceited.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think I’ve achieved my goal of finding the real Yayoi-chan, but for some reason, I think my worries are only getting stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">What do I want to do?</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Spring, which has been misled by my numerous curiosities since I became a sophomore, is going to end soon. The light shining through the window is getting warmer and warmer, and the season is moving on, unaware of our existence in the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A breeze blew in through the window like the remnants of spring, puffing the white curtains of the classroom wide open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew I would have to find the answer to this question by myself.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, may I have a word?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was after school, just before Golden Week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was looking at a handout of the career path survey handed out in homeroom earlier, a voice called out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked up slowly at the subdued tone of her voice and saw Yayoi-chan standing there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, I was wondering if you were busy?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She looked at the prints on my desk and seemed to be concerned, but I quietly put them in my bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How could I say no to Yayoi-chan when she’s the one who began talking to me in the classroom?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s okay. I was just about to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I showed her the bag I was carrying and glanced outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is this an invitation to go home together? Yes, it is. Of course it is!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, do you want to go home with me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I answered in an unintentionally handsome voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We quietly left the classroom together so as not to be noticed by my classmates who were scribbling on the blackboard behind us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I figured that this might be my last chance to ask her out on a date during Golden Week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I got on the escalator, Yayoi-chan followed behind me with a bit of a distance. Holding her bag with both hands, she looked like a normal high school girl, which was </span><span class="calibre8">somewhat refreshing compared to her previous look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, have you turned in your career plan yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I asked her while we were taking the escalator down to the first floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We were supposed to write down your desired career path and submit it at the end of the Golden Week holidays.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Mhm, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan replied back in a small voice, as if she was having difficulty answering my question, and I was a bit taken aback.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was a stupid question. How could I ask such a sensitive thing to Yayoi-chan, who’s actually an agent?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“How about you, Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Not yet. I’m still thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Aren’t you going forward with higher education?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Probably, I think I might.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I mumbled and bit my lip, as if I was thinking about something else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Otomachi High School is an advanced school, and most of the students go on to college after they’re done. I’m sure that I will be following that exact path too, but I could not </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">say for sure if that was going to be my choice or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What do I want to do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I run into my usual vague worries again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Will I be automatically carried into the future like the escalator I’m riding now, will I be carried along the path that was clearly laid out for me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s quite an absurd thing for a high-school sophomore to decide on a career path by calculating that far into the future.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan slipped out a few words in response. I couldn’t read the emotion within them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In Yayoi-chan’s mind, I was probably blessed to be able to freely choose my own career path. Either way, it was a topic that I should not have breached.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who has a future as an agent waiting for her, must be more troubled than me, who is still aiming for a career path of sorts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The future may be limitless for high school students, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s a clear path ahead for one. It’s kind of difficult, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, the thing is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we exited the school building, Yayoi-chan stopped, as if she had finally found the right moment to speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stared at her face, and Yayoi inhaled quickly to catch her breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to learn to play the piano!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She must have been preparing for this for a long time, because she let out the words in one gulp, the corners of her mouth turning up in a small grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I’m learning to play the piano. The night Fukase-kun came over, my father came home and asked me to play for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That was less than a week ago, right? You could have told me earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was going to tell you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked apologetic at my words, but it was tantalizing to think that she had been trying to find the right moment to tell me about it all along.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But, that’s good for you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so happy to hear that news that I felt as if something good was happening to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan said it herself, and what she wanted to do came true!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I did a lot of research, but I thought it was kind of a stretch to go to piano lessons or something like that… Because I can only play ‘Canon’, you know? I don’t know anything </span><span class="calibre8">about it, I suck at it, and my right and left hands don’t move together at all…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan spoke quickly and fidgetly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The first thing I did was look at her face as it got redder and redder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why, please! I want Fukase-kun to teach me how to play the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said that sentence in a very loud voice and bowed her head. Her black hair fell smoothly off her shoulders, and her ears were stained in a bright red shade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“M-me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Please!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s heartfelt request left me puzzled for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still couldn’t play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That day, when I listened to Yayoi-chan’s “Canon,” I received the message that I should not be afraid of failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I was still unable to take that first step.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried several times to play the piano at home, but I haven’t been able to do so recently because Sanae has been practicing diligently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I couldn’t refuse her request at this point. I could at least manage to teach her the basics. Yayoi was trying to be brave and do what she wanted to do, but I couldn’t show </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">her that I was hesitant to help her out. I can’t show her that I’m not cool anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I said clearly and Yayoi-chan looked up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Surely. But I still…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, let’s go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan grabbed my arm quickly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You said you’d teach me, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s eyes narrowed as she smiled and tugged at the sleeve of my blazer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where are we going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was being taken somewhere by force, not daring to look at the students who were on their way back home after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s aggressive behavior made me think of Uzuki. I had thought the two sisters didn’t resemble each other at all, but I guess that’s not true after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Fufu! </span></i><span class="calibre8">I’m not telling!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan glanced at me whilst her hair fluttered about in the wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a tug on my hand, I pass a wave of students in a steady stream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This road is one I had come to quite some time ago. This is the same road where I had followed Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I ran along the tree-lined path along the moat, looking up at Hiroshima Castle. The sun was shining and the trees were green and shimmering brightly, the two of us were in the center of the early summer scenery.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We entered an underground passageway, just like we did at that time. This time, we entered together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, by any chance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we ran down the gentle slope, I noticed where Yayoi-chan was headed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I entered the paleo from the underpass, I saw my destination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t stop like I did last time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We’re here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan turned around in front of the street piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I want to hear your demonstration, Fukase-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She had straight, semi-long black hair and large, dark eyes that felt as if it’d absorb me whole.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She’s tall and slender, with long, graceful arms and legs and a model-like style, with a neat and dignified presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This part of her has not changed ever since the first time I met her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The only difference from the first time I met her that afternoon at the festival was the expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now, her eyes were wide, she had two dimples and a smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s the smile I’ve always wanted to see come from Yayoi-chan, the most beautiful girl in the school, sparkling, dazzling and full of hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the real Yayoi-chan that I had found.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My psychometry and Yayoi-chan’s job as an agent, our mutual secret, made us who we are today. No, there was one more thing that connected the two of us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sure you’ll be fine, Fukase-kun! I’m confident that you’ll be able to play it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan holds both of my hands in front of her chest and nods her head broadly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She affirms me, very strongly, as if she were giving me courage to go on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And I answered back.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course. I’m good at the piano after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wasn’t being stubborn here. This time, it was true.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a weekday evening, so there were fewer people on the street than before. But when I sat down in my chair, few people stopped by.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Phew…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took a deep breath and straightened my back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The situation has changed since our first date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Since then, Yayoi-chan has gathered her courage and stepped forward to do what she wanted to do. I thought I was the one who was pushing her back, but before I knew it, she </span><span class="calibre8">was actually pushing my back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I quickly put my hands out on the keyboard. My fingers melt between the black and white keys. There was no distance between me and the piano like before. I felt nostalgic and fresh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s all right now. I glanced over at Yayoi-chan, who was standing next to me, her eyelids fluttering down and her hands clasped in a prayer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well then, I’ll play…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s the same song I had played at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Amorosi miei giorni” – translated into Japanese as Watashi no ai no hibi (My Days of Love)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was one of the songs in a collection of 36 arias in the classical style by Donaudi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The keyboard for the first note felt heavy. But my body remembered the rest. My fingers moved on their own, and the melody I had pictured in my mind flowed directly to my </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">fingers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard Yayoi-chan’s voice, as if she was touched by me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I began to play, I was no longer nervous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The fact that Yayoi-chan was next to me helped me get over my trauma.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I played the piano for the first time in six months, I remembered many things that had happened during that time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I first met Yayoi-chan at the Piloti, she was a really unsociable girl, a girl who lived up to the bad rumors and was a person who was too high of a stature for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even after I found out that she liked me through psychometry, the distance between me and Yayoi-chan remained distant. I was afraid to get close to her, so I only quietly followed her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We had various secrets, worries, and walls within our hearts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But we pushed each other to overcome our worries and trauma. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We tried to support each other. We tried to protect one another. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We overcame our issues, we faced them with each other, and now we are together like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s a line in the lyrics of this song that goes something like this</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">If only we could hold on to one hope for as long as there is life.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">No longer fearing the pain of a false life… </span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Let her gaze be all my radiance, her smile all my treasure.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">And with only the hope that “I will be all that I can be.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What was I fighting against then? The huge audience? Mayo-senpai? Myself?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was trying to show my ability, trying to look good, trying to perform with smugness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was playing to myself, trying to show what I could do, trying to look good just for my self-satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But now, it’s different.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m playing for Yayoi-chan right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s because I want to see her smile. I want to see the real Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s what I can do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What I can do, not for myself, but for someone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was so thrilled…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After the performance was over, I let out the breath I had been unconsciously holding in at Yayoi-chan’s words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My fingers were shaking a little, but the touch of the piano after half a year was nostalgic and very gentle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was so impressed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said again for emphasis and clapped her hands brightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to be modest, saying I wasn’t very good at it, but I accepted Yayoi-chan’s compliments.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re amazing, Fukase-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretended not to see the tears welling up in Yayoi-chan’s big eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, it’s a little embarrassing to be that impressed, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I scratched my cheeks to hide my embarrassment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You played the piano well…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan exaggerated. I’m not sure which one of us is the piano teacher or the student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m so glad you’re here, Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I said, too, with a sense of accomplishment that I had overcome the obstacle in my heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m the one who gave you hope, Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We both looked at each other and laughed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A glimmer of hope seemed to shine between us.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On the way from Paleo to Hondori Station, Yayoi-chan’s cheeks were cherry red as she walked next to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seemed that Yayoi-chan was more excited than I was after playing the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a strange feeling to be walking next to each other shoulder to shoulder like this, even though we had always only stared at each other’s backs the entire time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s no need for any more fantasies right now. This is absolutely real.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan noticed that I was glancing at her and twisted her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She doesn’t glare at me like she used to anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“N-nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I understand that the reason she was glaring at me was to hide her true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Weirdo.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan giggled, not hiding her feelings any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was so much more I wanted to tell her, but I felt like I didn’t need to try to know everything right now. I know that there are things that I don’t need to know as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you for today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan thanked me profusely as we arrived at the station’s ticket gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m the one who should be thanking you. Thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was time to go home, and the station was crowded. In the midst of the mingling hustle and bustle, everyone was moving with a purpose. Thinking about something, for </span><span class="calibre8">something, to the right or to the left. There were no meaningless people anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We, too, are ordinary high school students here and now. I don’t know what the future holds, but for now, that’s all we can do. If we keep walking forward, that will surely become the path for us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who quickly brushed her hair behind her ear, looked me up and down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Will you continue to teach me the piano?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her dark, beautiful eyes were crystal clear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m fine now, so I can always teach you whenever you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretend to play the piano with both hands and make a playful gesture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I get home, let’s practice for the first time in a while. I’ve been listening to Sanae play badly every day, so it’s time for me to show some dignity as a big brother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The train will be coming soon, so I’ll be on my way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at the timetable and was about to head for the ticket gate to say goodbye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly Yayoi-chan grabbed my bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I have one more thing I want to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan turned her head slightly and began to fidget a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The right and left toes of her shoes were touching each other, and her mouth twitched like a bird that had forgotten how to chirp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This teasing gesture made me unable to move, and my imagination ran wild.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No way, it’s time to go home, right…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We’re not that close yet…!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan grabs my bag a bit and looks up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I inhaled quickly, and Yayoi-chan opened her mouth as if she had made a decision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pouted my lips, still in a golden state of adolescence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……can I call you Satsuki-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan whispered in a voice that only I could hear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her face was bright red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My heart almost jumped out of my mouth and I pulled my lips back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course… Yayoi-chan!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I called out Yayoi-chan’s name for the first time, with a million thoughts inside my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Come to think of it, when we psychometricized before, you said you wanted me to call you by your name, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was able to make one more thing that Yayoi-chan wanted come true!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m off then. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan fidgeted and held out her left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took her hand without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you, Satsuki-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Thank you, Satsuki-kun.</span></i><span class="calibre8">’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s voice matched the voice in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Yayoi-chan’s true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan can’t hide her secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But the Yayoi-chan in front of me now has no secrets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you, Yayoi-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still feel a little embarrassed to actually say that name out loud. My face is probably redder than hers right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel as if I don’t need to say anything more to get the message across, so I run into the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve found out and Yayoi-chan doesn’t want me to know.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan will not give up everything because of her job as an agent. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She can do whatever she wants to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know what the future holds for Yayoi-chan, but I want to continue to push her forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to be the sun that always shines on her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I also hope that one day I will be able to tell you the secret of my left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And also this feeling that makes me nervous whenever I think of Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before the stairs, I look back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan was waving at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I give her a small wave back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This left hand is not there to find out someone’s secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s there to hold hands with you someday.</span></p>
<h1 class="calibre3">16 - Chapter 16 - Satsuki-kun and Yayoi-chan</h1>
<div class="calibre1">


<h3 class="calibre6"><b class="calibre11">Satsuki-kun and Yayoi-chan</b></h3><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we entered our second year, April was coming to an end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As the season began to change from spring to summer, another change also occurred within our class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s absence was over in just three days, and the day after I visited her, she came to school just as usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That ‘stay away from me’ aura seemed to have faded, and she no longer ignored her classmates when they spoke to her, she instead began to smile and converse with them like a normal student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This was soon spread throughout the entire school and was even rumored to be known as the “Strange Incident of Class 7, Year 2”. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s sure to become one of the most significant incidents in the history of Otomachi High School. Yayoi-chan is always so full of rumors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even Mayama had said to me, “Maybe it’s because of that date with you, don’t you think so?” But I just calmly laughed at his words. I wanted to tell him that it wasn’t just that, but that piano date was a secret between the two of us. Yes, it’s a memory that only the two of us will have.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Another thing that changed was that we switched seats in class. I ended up in the frontmost seat right by the window, so I couldn’t look at the back of Yayoi-chan’s head during </span><span class="calibre8">class anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I guess that’s okay. When I casually looked back at Yayoi-chan from time to time, she raised her eyebrows as if she was going to glare at me, but the very next moment she would just smile back at me. Her smile was still awkward, like a cat when it had been caught doing something red-handed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to use the opportunity to ask her out on a second date during Golden Week, but unlike last time, I didn’t have a chance to ask her out, so I was holding back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I asked her out once, so it should be easy. Because Yayoi-chan thinks I’m cool, right?” I was conflicted between the aggressive me and the reserved me, “Even in the midst of friendship, there is etiquette. I am a reserved person, be modest and don’t be conceited.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think I’ve achieved my goal of finding the real Yayoi-chan, but for some reason, I think my worries are only getting stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">What do I want to do?</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Spring, which has been misled by my numerous curiosities since I became a sophomore, is going to end soon. The light shining through the window is getting warmer and warmer, and the season is moving on, unaware of our existence in the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A breeze blew in through the window like the remnants of spring, puffing the white curtains of the classroom wide open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew I would have to find the answer to this question by myself.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, may I have a word?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was after school, just before Golden Week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was looking at a handout of the career path survey handed out in homeroom earlier, a voice called out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked up slowly at the subdued tone of her voice and saw Yayoi-chan standing there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, I was wondering if you were busy?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She looked at the prints on my desk and seemed to be concerned, but I quietly put them in my bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How could I say no to Yayoi-chan when she’s the one who began talking to me in the classroom?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, it’s okay. I was just about to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I showed her the bag I was carrying and glanced outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Is this an invitation to go home together? Yes, it is. Of course it is!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, do you want to go home with me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I answered in an unintentionally handsome voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We quietly left the classroom together so as not to be noticed by my classmates who were scribbling on the blackboard behind us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I figured that this might be my last chance to ask her out on a date during Golden Week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I got on the escalator, Yayoi-chan followed behind me with a bit of a distance. Holding her bag with both hands, she looked like a normal high school girl, which was </span><span class="calibre8">somewhat refreshing compared to her previous look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, have you turned in your career plan yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I asked her while we were taking the escalator down to the first floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We were supposed to write down your desired career path and submit it at the end of the Golden Week holidays.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Mhm, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan replied back in a small voice, as if she was having difficulty answering my question, and I was a bit taken aback.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was a stupid question. How could I ask such a sensitive thing to Yayoi-chan, who’s actually an agent?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“How about you, Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Not yet. I’m still thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Aren’t you going forward with higher education?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Probably, I think I might.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I mumbled and bit my lip, as if I was thinking about something else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Otomachi High School is an advanced school, and most of the students go on to college after they’re done. I’m sure that I will be following that exact path too, but I could not </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">say for sure if that was going to be my choice or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What do I want to do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I run into my usual vague worries again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Will I be automatically carried into the future like the escalator I’m riding now, will I be carried along the path that was clearly laid out for me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s quite an absurd thing for a high-school sophomore to decide on a career path by calculating that far into the future.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan slipped out a few words in response. I couldn’t read the emotion within them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In Yayoi-chan’s mind, I was probably blessed to be able to freely choose my own career path. Either way, it was a topic that I should not have breached.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who has a future as an agent waiting for her, must be more troubled than me, who is still aiming for a career path of sorts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The future may be limitless for high school students, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s a clear path ahead for one. It’s kind of difficult, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, the thing is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we exited the school building, Yayoi-chan stopped, as if she had finally found the right moment to speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stared at her face, and Yayoi inhaled quickly to catch her breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to learn to play the piano!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She must have been preparing for this for a long time, because she let out the words in one gulp, the corners of her mouth turning up in a small grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I’m learning to play the piano. The night Fukase-kun came over, my father came home and asked me to play for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That was less than a week ago, right? You could have told me earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was going to tell you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked apologetic at my words, but it was tantalizing to think that she had been trying to find the right moment to tell me about it all along.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But, that’s good for you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so happy to hear that news that I felt as if something good was happening to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan said it herself, and what she wanted to do came true!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I did a lot of research, but I thought it was kind of a stretch to go to piano lessons or something like that… Because I can only play ‘Canon’, you know? I don’t know anything </span><span class="calibre8">about it, I suck at it, and my right and left hands don’t move together at all…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan spoke quickly and fidgetly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The first thing I did was look at her face as it got redder and redder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why, please! I want Fukase-kun to teach me how to play the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said that sentence in a very loud voice and bowed her head. Her black hair fell smoothly off her shoulders, and her ears were stained in a bright red shade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“M-me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Please!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s heartfelt request left me puzzled for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still couldn’t play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That day, when I listened to Yayoi-chan’s “Canon,” I received the message that I should not be afraid of failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I was still unable to take that first step.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried several times to play the piano at home, but I haven’t been able to do so recently because Sanae has been practicing diligently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I couldn’t refuse her request at this point. I could at least manage to teach her the basics. Yayoi was trying to be brave and do what she wanted to do, but I couldn’t show </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">her that I was hesitant to help her out. I can’t show her that I’m not cool anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I said clearly and Yayoi-chan looked up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Surely. But I still…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, let’s go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan grabbed my arm quickly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You said you’d teach me, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s eyes narrowed as she smiled and tugged at the sleeve of my blazer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where are we going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was being taken somewhere by force, not daring to look at the students who were on their way back home after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s aggressive behavior made me think of Uzuki. I had thought the two sisters didn’t resemble each other at all, but I guess that’s not true after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Fufu! </span></i><span class="calibre8">I’m not telling!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan glanced at me whilst her hair fluttered about in the wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a tug on my hand, I pass a wave of students in a steady stream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This road is one I had come to quite some time ago. This is the same road where I had followed Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I ran along the tree-lined path along the moat, looking up at Hiroshima Castle. The sun was shining and the trees were green and shimmering brightly, the two of us were in the center of the early summer scenery.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We entered an underground passageway, just like we did at that time. This time, we entered together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, by any chance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As we ran down the gentle slope, I noticed where Yayoi-chan was headed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I entered the paleo from the underpass, I saw my destination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t stop like I did last time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We’re here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan turned around in front of the street piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I want to hear your demonstration, Fukase-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She had straight, semi-long black hair and large, dark eyes that felt as if it’d absorb me whole.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She’s tall and slender, with long, graceful arms and legs and a model-like style, with a neat and dignified presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This part of her has not changed ever since the first time I met her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The only difference from the first time I met her that afternoon at the festival was the expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now, her eyes were wide, she had two dimples and a smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s the smile I’ve always wanted to see come from Yayoi-chan, the most beautiful girl in the school, sparkling, dazzling and full of hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the real Yayoi-chan that I had found.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My psychometry and Yayoi-chan’s job as an agent, our mutual secret, made us who we are today. No, there was one more thing that connected the two of us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sure you’ll be fine, Fukase-kun! I’m confident that you’ll be able to play it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan holds both of my hands in front of her chest and nods her head broadly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She affirms me, very strongly, as if she were giving me courage to go on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And I answered back.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course. I’m good at the piano after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wasn’t being stubborn here. This time, it was true.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a weekday evening, so there were fewer people on the street than before. But when I sat down in my chair, few people stopped by.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Phew…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took a deep breath and straightened my back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The situation has changed since our first date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Since then, Yayoi-chan has gathered her courage and stepped forward to do what she wanted to do. I thought I was the one who was pushing her back, but before I knew it, she </span><span class="calibre8">was actually pushing my back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I quickly put my hands out on the keyboard. My fingers melt between the black and white keys. There was no distance between me and the piano like before. I felt nostalgic and fresh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s all right now. I glanced over at Yayoi-chan, who was standing next to me, her eyelids fluttering down and her hands clasped in a prayer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well then, I’ll play…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s the same song I had played at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Amorosi miei giorni” – translated into Japanese as Watashi no ai no hibi (My Days of Love)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was one of the songs in a collection of 36 arias in the classical style by Donaudi.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The keyboard for the first note felt heavy. But my body remembered the rest. My fingers moved on their own, and the melody I had pictured in my mind flowed directly to my </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">fingers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I heard Yayoi-chan’s voice, as if she was touched by me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I began to play, I was no longer nervous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The fact that Yayoi-chan was next to me helped me get over my trauma.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I played the piano for the first time in six months, I remembered many things that had happened during that time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I first met Yayoi-chan at the Piloti, she was a really unsociable girl, a girl who lived up to the bad rumors and was a person who was too high of a stature for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even after I found out that she liked me through psychometry, the distance between me and Yayoi-chan remained distant. I was afraid to get close to her, so I only quietly followed her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We had various secrets, worries, and walls within our hearts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But we pushed each other to overcome our worries and trauma. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We tried to support each other. We tried to protect one another. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We overcame our issues, we faced them with each other, and now we are together like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s a line in the lyrics of this song that goes something like this</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">If only we could hold on to one hope for as long as there is life.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">No longer fearing the pain of a false life… </span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Let her gaze be all my radiance, her smile all my treasure.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">And with only the hope that “I will be all that I can be.”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What was I fighting against then? The huge audience? Mayo-senpai? Myself?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was trying to show my ability, trying to look good, trying to perform with smugness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was playing to myself, trying to show what I could do, trying to look good just for my self-satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But now, it’s different.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m playing for Yayoi-chan right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s because I want to see her smile. I want to see the real Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s what I can do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What I can do, not for myself, but for someone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was so thrilled…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After the performance was over, I let out the breath I had been unconsciously holding in at Yayoi-chan’s words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My fingers were shaking a little, but the touch of the piano after half a year was nostalgic and very gentle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was so impressed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said again for emphasis and clapped her hands brightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to be modest, saying I wasn’t very good at it, but I accepted Yayoi-chan’s compliments.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’re amazing, Fukase-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretended not to see the tears welling up in Yayoi-chan’s big eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, it’s a little embarrassing to be that impressed, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I scratched my cheeks to hide my embarrassment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You played the piano well…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan exaggerated. I’m not sure which one of us is the piano teacher or the student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m so glad you’re here, Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I said, too, with a sense of accomplishment that I had overcome the obstacle in my heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m the one who gave you hope, Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We both looked at each other and laughed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A glimmer of hope seemed to shine between us.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On the way from Paleo to Hondori Station, Yayoi-chan’s cheeks were cherry red as she walked next to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It seemed that Yayoi-chan was more excited than I was after playing the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a strange feeling to be walking next to each other shoulder to shoulder like this, even though we had always only stared at each other’s backs the entire time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There’s no need for any more fantasies right now. This is absolutely real.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan noticed that I was glancing at her and twisted her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She doesn’t glare at me like she used to anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“N-nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I understand that the reason she was glaring at me was to hide her true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Weirdo.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan giggled, not hiding her feelings any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was so much more I wanted to tell her, but I felt like I didn’t need to try to know everything right now. I know that there are things that I don’t need to know as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you for today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan thanked me profusely as we arrived at the station’s ticket gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m the one who should be thanking you. Thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was time to go home, and the station was crowded. In the midst of the mingling hustle and bustle, everyone was moving with a purpose. Thinking about something, for </span><span class="calibre8">something, to the right or to the left. There were no meaningless people anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We, too, are ordinary high school students here and now. I don’t know what the future holds, but for now, that’s all we can do. If we keep walking forward, that will surely become the path for us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who quickly brushed her hair behind her ear, looked me up and down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Will you continue to teach me the piano?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her dark, beautiful eyes were crystal clear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m fine now, so I can always teach you whenever you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pretend to play the piano with both hands and make a playful gesture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I get home, let’s practice for the first time in a while. I’ve been listening to Sanae play badly every day, so it’s time for me to show some dignity as a big brother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The train will be coming soon, so I’ll be on my way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at the timetable and was about to head for the ticket gate to say goodbye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah, wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly Yayoi-chan grabbed my bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I have one more thing I want to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan turned her head slightly and began to fidget a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The right and left toes of her shoes were touching each other, and her mouth twitched like a bird that had forgotten how to chirp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This teasing gesture made me unable to move, and my imagination ran wild.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No way, it’s time to go home, right…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We’re not that close yet…!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan grabs my bag a bit and looks up at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I inhaled quickly, and Yayoi-chan opened her mouth as if she had made a decision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I pouted my lips, still in a golden state of adolescence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……can I call you Satsuki-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan whispered in a voice that only I could hear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her face was bright red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My heart almost jumped out of my mouth and I pulled my lips back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course… Yayoi-chan!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I called out Yayoi-chan’s name for the first time, with a million thoughts inside my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Come to think of it, when we psychometricized before, you said you wanted me to call you by your name, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was able to make one more thing that Yayoi-chan wanted come true!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m off then. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan fidgeted and held out her left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took her hand without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you, Satsuki-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Thank you, Satsuki-kun.</span></i><span class="calibre8">’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s voice matched the voice in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Yayoi-chan’s true feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan can’t hide her secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But the Yayoi-chan in front of me now has no secrets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you, Yayoi-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I still feel a little embarrassed to actually say that name out loud. My face is probably redder than hers right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I feel as if I don’t need to say anything more to get the message across, so I run into the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve found out and Yayoi-chan doesn’t want me to know.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan will not give up everything because of her job as an agent. </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She can do whatever she wants to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t know what the future holds for Yayoi-chan, but I want to continue to push her forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to be the sun that always shines on her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I also hope that one day I will be able to tell you the secret of my left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And also this feeling that makes me nervous whenever I think of Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before the stairs, I look back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan was waving at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I give her a small wave back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This left hand is not there to find out someone’s secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s there to hold hands with you someday.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"> <span class="calibre8">The spring breeze no longer bothers me…</span></p>
