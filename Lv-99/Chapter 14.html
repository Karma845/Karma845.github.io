<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 14 - What I Can Do For You</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Hah…</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I came home from my date and let out a huge sigh that I had been holding back for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was nobody else at home. It was a relief to be home so early and not have Sanae think that I had failed my date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Instead of going back to my room, I headed straight for the Japanese-styled room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Since my mother is a piano teacher, we had an upright piano in our house for practice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On top of the blackwood frame was a metronome, a no-bra CD that Sanae must have left behind, and some handwritten music sheets that she had copied by ear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I took off the cover over the keys and sat down on the chair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hadn’t sat at this piano ever since the day I had practiced before the festival. I had been avoiding it for the past six months.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Fuu…”</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put my hand on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to make sure that my earlier inability to play on the street piano was just temporary. I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t like I couldn’t play it at all anymore, but that I was just a little nervous in front of Yayoi-chan. It couldn’t have been due to trauma, I told myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I won’t say that I don’t regret the mistake I made in a packed gymnasium. It was just a tiny fluke that kept me away from the piano for a little while.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s because I had loved playing the piano ever since I was a little kid, and I didn’t think that something like that would stop me from playing it ever again… It can’t be. That’s as far as I got…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to play the same Donaudi piece as I did back then. Of course, I remember the sheet music clearly. The melody is still in my head. I can vividly picture the melody inside my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried and tried… but I still couldn’t move my hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t play the piano anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“This sucks…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hung my head in disappointment at myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sure Yayoi-chan was just trying to make me happy. If I had played the piano in a stylish way, this date would have been perfect.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And yet…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder if Yayoi-chan is entitled to tell me to do what she wants to, when she can’t even do what she wants herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">A few hours ago I was very excited about our first date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now, I’m devastated by my own hopelessness, and I’ve hit rock bottom.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The date ended in failure.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can no longer find the real Yayoi-chan nor play my favorite piano.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Monday.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Good morning…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I entered the classroom, all my classmates’ gazes focused on me at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki! Over here, over here!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama was already waiting for me at my desk and beckoning me to come over. I could almost imagine what he was up to, because his eyes were smiling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced at Yayoi-chan’s seat and saw that she had not arrived yet, even though she usually arrives early for school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course something did! You had a date, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stopped him before he got any further into it, but Mayama sat on my desk with a thump and got involved. He’s been annoying me since this morning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Since I had so brazenly asked Yayoi-chan out on a date in the classroom, my classmates seemed to be listening in on our conversation, eager to know the outcome.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, I had nothing to brag about, and I didn’t want to be reminded of it anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, where were you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where were we…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama, with his nose flashing, asked me something trivial. It would be a mistake to say what “where” refers to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, don’t tell me you went home in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Of course not!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The imagination of a high school boy seems to have no bounds this morning. I can’t speak for Mayama, but I had a lot of fantasies too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m f*****g jealous! It’s not fair, it’s only you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama pressed his fist against the desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can understand why Mayama would be jealous of me, since it is true that Yayoi-chan is considered the most beautiful girl in the school, despite some bad rumors about her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But right now I can’t get carried away or brag about it at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I mean, did you even have a proper conversation or something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama, who only knows Yayoi-chan’s state in the classroom, bends forward in curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well, in case you’re wondering…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I hope this helps her get comfortable in class. I wish I could talk to her too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I hope so…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was the original goal after all. That’s what I’m hoping for too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was able to have some reasonable conversations and Yayoi-chan tried to smile at me in her own way. I wish I could get her to open up to the class like that, but the only thing that bothers me is the bad aftertaste at the end of the date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If only I had been more firm… </span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, everyone sit down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While I was messing around with Mayama, the chime rang and the homeroom teacher entered the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">While everyone rattled around and took their seats, I noticed that Yayoi-chan hadn’t arrived yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What’s going on? Is she late? She’s usually earlier though?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita is absent today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I rattle my chair at the sound of Shinoda-sensei’s voice as she checks the attendance record.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My classmates’ gazes darted to my reaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong, Fukase?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan is absent? Is she on sick leave?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">No, maybe it’s…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With the timing of her absence, it was natural to wonder if it was because of our date on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Was it because she met her father? Did he scold her for going on a date with me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Or is it because I couldn’t play the piano? Was she that disappointed in me and so she didn’t want to see me again?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can think of all sorts of bad scenarios, but they’re all not impossible to occur.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t ask the homeroom teacher why she was absent, and after all, she </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">was </span></i><span class="calibre8">an agent, so it was possible that she was absent due to work instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Without any answer, that day became the first day since I started the second year where Yayoi-chan wasn’t in the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But it did not end there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The next day, Tuesday, and yet again on Wednesday, Yayoi-chan was still absent from school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My feeling of doom was accelerating.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the third day since Yayoi-chan had stopped coming to school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was lunchtime, and I was on my way home after buying some bread at the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to take the escalator from the first floor when I was stopped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked up toward the voice and saw Uzuki leaning out of the second floor stairwell. I turned my head immediately away, almost seeing the inside of her skirt from down below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I have to go over there for a minute, so please wait for me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said, running down the escalator.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was actually thinking of going to the first-year classroom floor to see Uzuki-chan during my lunch break anyway, so this is convenient.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, the purpose of that was……</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What happened to Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as Uzuki-chan came down to the first floor, I immediately asked about Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I guessed another reason for Uzuki’s tone of voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I guess she wasn’t on sick leave after all?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As expected, Uzuki nodded her head with her mouth in a grimace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Actually, yesterday, Mayama had asked her homeroom teacher to confirm the reason for Yayoi-chan’s absence. According to the homeroom teacher, Yayoi-chan had a cold, but I didn’t really believe her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“In fact, my sister stopped coming out of her room completely.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? What do you mean she stopped coming out of her room?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reason was completely unexpected and unnerving.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I saw her when we had dinner, but she didn’t talk to me about anything. I didn’t think that she would even miss school though…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The way she thought about her sister with her lips twitching, she was not her usual cheerful self.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why would she do that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s my fault. It’s because I made fun of my sister and teased her about Satsuki-senpai…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan’s eyebrows drop and her shoulders slump, as if she was about to start crying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Uzuki didn’t do anything wrong! I knew it, it was because of what happened on Saturday…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What happened on Saturday?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki asked me in a downcast manner, as if she was reluctant to say anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“‘There were a lot of things that happened that day…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not sure how much I should tell her about our date that day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t see how this is not related to the timing of Yayoi-chan starting to take a break.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“If you have something difficult to say to me, could you please talk to her directly? I think Sis would be willing to talk to you, Satsuki-senpai!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan holds her hands in front of her chest and gives me a sullen look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As a sibling and family member, it’s Uzuki who worries about her more than I do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Even if I talk to her…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, if there’s anything I can do, I would definitely do something about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was asked to open Yayoi-chan’s heart, but so far only the exact opposite has happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Could you come over to my house after school? Please meet my sister!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With tears in her eyes, Uzuki’s request was impossible to refuse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After school that day, I met up with Uzuki at the school gate and we headed for the Kinoshita household.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to get things a little more straightened out before I met Yayoi-chan, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Has Kinoshita-san been acting strangely ever since Saturday?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On the way back to the Kinoshita house. The first time I saw her, she was walking a little quickly, and it was obvious that she wanted to get home as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was at a friend’s house that day, and when I came back in the evening, my sister was already locked up in her room. At first I thought maybe Satsuki-senpai had dumped her…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She looked up at me with a glare, but her eyes were serious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“T-That’s not true!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was embarrassed to deny it, but I had to answer seriously considering her sister’s feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um… your dad didn’t say anything about it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Dad? Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki stared at me with a strange look in her eyes. Apparently, she hadn’t heard that I had met their father on the way to the date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I actually ran into your father on the way over.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wasn’t sure whether I should tell her that or not, but I felt like I should.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Actually, my Mom and Dad have been away on a business trip since Saturday. That’s why my sister has been taking these days off of her own will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I guess business trips are a part of an agent’s job.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The Kinoshita family probably has its own unique circumstances at home, and I cannot go into this part of the story without getting too into it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I thought maybe your father scolded her. If he saw his daughter with a man, he wouldn’t be at peace with it. And I got a stiff stare back then too…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If a guy like me, who I don’t even know what kind of horse I’m riding, was dating his daughter, then as a father, he would have been really angry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember the look he gave me at that time, as if he was assessing me, and it sent chills down my spine. It was the look of a man who had been through the trials and tribulations of being an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“He was just tense because he met Satsuki-senpai. He’s got bad eyesight and he’s shy, but he just looks like that and he’s actually very kind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t believe Uzuki’s words in their entirety, but she certainly didn’t seem to be angry with me from the way I psychometricized her father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Rather, he was happy to see Yayoi-chan laughing. His mind even leaked out that he wanted Yayoi-chan to be a normal girl. My left hand assured me that it was not a lie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“And it’s not like her to miss school just because she was scolded by Dad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘Well, what caused it then…? Didn’t she say anything?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Nope. She said nothing at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki really doesn’t seem to know the reason why and twists her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So what’s the cause of this then…? Is it anything related to her work as an agent? Or Is it because of me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We looked at each other and fell silent as if we were doing a crossword puzzle in which we couldn’t fill in the squares with the word “agent”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With no answer in sight as it stands, the Kinoshita family’s house approached us mercilessly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai is the only one I can rely on. Please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Bowing in front of the house, Uzuki-chan didn’t seem to be joking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes. I’ll do what I can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I agreed to Uzuki’s request, although it was hard for me to see her because of the failed date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If Yayoi-chan has grown tired of me, then that’s something I can’t really help.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If she thought I was cool when she saw me playing the piano at the school festival, then I would have no appeal now that I could no longer play it. I’m just a useless guy who can’t even escort a proper date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But even though I am like this, I really want to do something for Yayoi-chan. I can’t just leave her like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Please, come in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My second visit to the Kinoshita house was a different kind of experience than back before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Looking up at the Kinoshita house again, I saw that it was a magnificent building in a quiet residential area.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had no idea what to expect then, so I just followed Uzuki and didn’t go inside, but today I came over with a firm purpose in mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Sorry for the intrusion…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My back naturally straightens as I enter the Kinoshita household.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The house is quiet and a sweet smell wafts in from somewhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Wait. I’m going to go get my sister. You can wait for me on the sofa over there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan seemed to be upstairs in her room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was led into the living room, but I looked around uncomfortably.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was a magnificent couch and a tall shelf lined with expensive-looking glasses. On the table was a newspaper. Upon closer inspection, it was a newspaper written in English.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was more like a celebrity’s house than an agent’s house if I’m being frank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If you look closely, you can see a large number of trophies on the shelves, were they awarded for something agent-like? I’m afraid to look at them…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt kind of bad about sitting on the couch, so I just stood there and waited, and soon Uzuki came back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Where’s Kinoshita-san?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Nope, I can’t make her come down. Could you please come to her room instead?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Shaking her head, Uzuki’s spirits were low.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I doubt that Yayoi-chan would want to meet with me, but I have no choice but to do it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I followed Uzuki up the stairs. The door to Yayoi-chan’s room was simple and unadorned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Big Sis?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She knocked on the door and as Uzuki-chan and I waited quietly, Yayoi-chan’s grumpy voice came back, “What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-senpai’s here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ehh?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s voice immediately changed. At the same time, I could hear the sound of something moving with a clatter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why are you here, Fukase-kun? Wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, the situation in the room became hectic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Anyone would be surprised to suddenly have a classmate come into their room. I could hear the sound of something being opened and closed with a bang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After a while, the door opened a few centimeters and Yayoi-chan peeked out through the crack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, I’m sorry for coming so suddenly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I apologize to her for now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going downstairs. Satsuki-senpai, take your time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Uzuki-chan, perhaps acting a bit clever, went down the stairs. I was now completely in charge, and I felt tense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Come in.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The door was opened, and surprisingly, she let me into the room with candor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, Yayoi-chan was dressed in her school uniform. She must have changed her clothes when she heard that I was here. Her black jersey was sticking out a little from her closet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, excuse me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Of course, this was the first time for me to enter a girl’s room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s room was, in a single word, dull. The room was about the same size as my room, but it looked much larger, probably because there was nothing in there that was out of place. There was a bed, a desk, and a closet. That’s about all there was in it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remembered that she once told me that she had no hobbies. It didn’t look lively, or like a hotel room either, and there were extremely few colors present within. The black curtains seemed to symbolize this, and I felt as if I was watching a black-and-white Fellini movie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The only girly thing in the room was a stuffed bear that was kept on the desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong? Coming here all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan was as calm as ever, not snapping at me as she had done the last time I came here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She didn’t glare at me like she had in the past, but she didn’t smile either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You’ve been out of school for three days, so I was just curious.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ve been feeling a little sick…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As if to cover it up, Yayoi-chan touched her hair and turned her back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is it because of me that you’re absent?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t take Yayoi-chan’s words to heart, but instead cut right to the chase. I had confirmed with Uzuki that there was nothing wrong with her physical condition.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is it because I invited you to…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s not true!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As if to cut me off, Yayoi-chan turns around and denies it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Well then, why…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan did not answer me back. The expression on her face was complicated and it seemed as if she was hiding something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We both seemed to feel some kind of obligation to each other, and I could feel the air getting heavier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t play the piano, and Yayoi-chan met her father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Each of us was holding back, and each of us was reserved. It was as if we were wandering in a maze with no way out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Because there really isn’t any… I’m sorry for making you worry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan laughed brightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Showing her white teeth, it was a picture-perfect smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt uncomfortable with her smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Because Yayoi-chan, who’s not very good at smiling, was smiling so perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Really, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t pursue the matter once she had said so much. The moment I did, I would have no place in this room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then, I’m going home…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes… Thanks for coming all the way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I gave her a blank smile and tried to leave the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m sorry Uzuki, but I still couldn’t help her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t talk about her agent work, and I couldn’t talk about anything more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After all, information learned through psychometry is useless in reality. Secrets are secrets and cannot be revealed to one another.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was nothing I could do to open Yayoi-chan’s heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“See you at school again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Realizing how helpless it was, I gripped the door k**b.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The cool metal feeling of the door k**b made a certain memory flicker across my mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the afternoon of the festival, the first time I touched Yayoi-chan’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The unsociable, icy, salty Yayoi-chan Kinoshita was a distant presence that I had known only through rumors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even after learning of her fondness for me through psychometry, and even though we were in the same class, I kept staring at the back of her head. When our eyes met, she glared at me and we couldn’t even have a proper conversation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">We worked together by chance, and Uzuki-chan meddled with us, but in the end I did nothing for Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And yet, I am trying to escape again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am trying to admit my failure again, without being able to do anything for Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had decided to face her properly this time, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I turned the doorknob back and reflexively turned around to look inside the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“W-What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was about to leave when I suddenly turned around, and Yayoi-chan was surprised.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, I have something I want you to know!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I turned around and faced Yayoi-chan head-on once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fu-Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I shrugged my shoulders as if my serious attitude had been conveyed to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I, There’s something I haven’t told Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve been afraid to let my mind be known to others even though I could understand what another person’s mind would say due to my psychometry ability.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s what happened to me at the festival, the one that I had failed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I didn’t want to be disappointed. I didn’t want to be hated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew how Yayoi-chan felt about me, but that would be too cowardly of me. There was no way I could shorten the distance between us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If secrets were going to be a barrier, I have to expose my own secrets first.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am who I am now, including that failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You can’t change anything about other people by keeping quiet and hoping for the best.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The only person you can change is yourself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I won’t run away anymore. I won’t chase after their backs. No more relying on psychometry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ll push Yayoi-chan’s buttons by showing her that I’ll open up to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s what I can do now!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“About the piano the other day…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I voluntarily touched on a memory that I had never touched before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The reason I couldn’t play that time wasn’t because I forgot the sheet music.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I-Is that so…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s voice trails off, as if she doesn’t know how to react to this sudden confession.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Um, please sit down first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Perhaps deciding that this was going to be a complicated conversation, Yayoi-chan pointed to the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Both of us had been standing for a long time, and there were no cushions in this room, either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan sat down on the bed, and I sat down on the spot next to her. I could smell Yayoi-chan’s scent on me, and I was a little afraid of revealing my past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I squeeze my left hand to shake off the strange nervousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I… can’t play the piano anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I gulp in my breath and let out the trauma that’s been lingering in my heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked at me with concern, wondering if she should ask why.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“The reason is that I failed at last year’s festival. Wasn’t it terrible, that performance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t think of it as a failure. I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She denied my self-deprecating words, but swallowed her following words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even if Yayoi-chan had seen me fail at that time, it took courage to talk about it by myself like this. I realize how painful it is to reveal my hidden feelings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I had been playing the piano since I was little. No one told me to play it, but I started it on my own. You could say that it’s my only hobby. Of course, I still love it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan nodded silently beside me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“When my fingers touched the piano for the first time, I was moved by the sound it made. Then I practiced, and the sound became a melody, and I fell in love with the piano more and more. I never got tired of playing it, day after day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I think I was five years old when I was first exposed to the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember my mother getting angry with me when I touched the piano without understanding what I was doing. But little by little, I learned to read music, practiced as if competing with Sanae, and gradually became able to play it well. I did it because I wanted to, not because anyone praised me for it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I had confidence, you know? That’s why I was shocked that I failed… I had never played in front of anyone before, so I got nervous. I think I was traumatized by the fact that I</span> <span class="calibre8">interrupted Mayo-senpai.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s when I subconsciously distanced myself from the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I used to love playing the piano every day, but that mistake turned everything upside down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“On Saturday, in front of the piano, I realized for the first time how traumatic it was.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The horror I felt when I realized I could no longer play on that street piano makes my hands shake even as I recall it now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The separation between me and the piano. I felt like I had lost everything I had ever done.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……I couldn’t play the piano anymore.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Once again, I put the darkness of my heart into words and looked down at my outstretched hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I loved the sound that these ten fingers made. Each note played by these fingers would overlap and become a melody. The feeling of happiness was so rich.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Only when I was playing the piano, I was able to express myself freely. The sound that my fingers made was the most honest and truest of them all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had the piano, and the piano connected me to the world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But when I stopped touching it. I was truly alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun’s performance impressed me, you know? It was amazing that you could play it in front of such a large audience. I don’t think you failed, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I glanced at Yayoi-chan, who looked like she was about to cry even more than I was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was grateful that she said that, even if it was just to flatter me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“But, I can’t get that sigh I heard from inside the gym when I failed out of my head. I’ve been putting a lid on the memory for a long time, but when I sat down at the piano on Saturday, I remembered it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was a sigh that only I could hear. A sigh that I didn’t need to hear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s because I asked you to do something unreasonable…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s not true! It’s not Kinoshita-san’s fault. It’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan was holding my hands in her lap.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is my problem. A wall I have to get over.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know much about music, and I’ve only heard of the piano in music class, but even so, Fukase-kun’s performance…. to me was hope.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s words knocked on the door of my heart that I had kept closed for half a year.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hope…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yes, I could see it. A light of hope.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan gently placed her hand on her chest and closed her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“When I saw Fukase-kun playing the piano, I respected him for being able to do what he wanted to do…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan seemed to be remembering that performance of mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder what kind of scenery was reflected behind her eyelids.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was as if she was comparing me to herself, not being able to do what she wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s why you don’t have to think of yourself as a failure, because it reached me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan put her hands in front of her chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Now I know why she thought I was such a cool guy. I had never thought that my failed performance had moved Yayoi-chan’s heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had only been able to perform for myself, but I was able to reach only one person, Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was also a hope for me. I was not alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you. Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt saved and thanked her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had only heard rumors about Yayoi-chan six months ago, but now she was standing next to me, encouraging me so brightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She blushes easily, is sisterly, gives her dog a funny name, usually wears a black jersey, likes sweets, and has a bad smile…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">These are the various sorts of Yayoi-chan’s I’ve found so far.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just like notes on a blank sheet of music, various Yayoi-chan’s make up melodies too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Just by sneaking a peek into her mind with psychometry, nothing will change. Nothing can be done by just learning things about her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t even make her quit being an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So I’ll just push her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So that Yayoi-chan can do what she </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">wants </span></i><span class="calibre8">to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not doing what I want to do right now, but I’m going to do my best so that I can play the piano again. So, Kinoshita-san, too…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t mention any of the agent stuff, but I’m sure that Yayoi-chan will get the message.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I want you to do what you want to do too, Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I confided everything I wanted to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Somehow, the blurring of my mind seemed to have cleared up with those words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I told her about the piano, about my trauma, and about my feelings for Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I grabbed my knees and turned to the side, and Yayoi-chan’s face was red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stared at her face, as if waiting for a flower bud to open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s piercing voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The distance between the two of us, so close and yet so far.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan takes her time, not trying to hide her red face, not trying to cover it up by touching her hair, but looking up with a pout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Me too, there’s something I want to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s eyes, which seemed to be lost in thought, finally opened and she stood up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It also has something to do with Fukase-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“With me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My crystal-clear emotions shook again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So, I’ve been wanting to do this for the past six months. I’ve been taking time off from school to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was surprised at the sudden link to the reason why I had come here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan got up and opened the closet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan took out a small toy piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I bought it last year. I can’t afford a proper one, so it’s just a toy for kids.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She patted the piano shyly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I only bought it and hardly touched it, But Saturday, after I got home, I practiced it all day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan touched her hair again and again, acting very embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Practicing? the piano?”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She nodded and put her hand on the toy piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wanted Fukase-kun to listen to me…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t hide my surprise at the reason.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She took time off from school to practice the piano for me to hear?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan sits on her haunches in front of a small toy piano. I watched her silently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I didn’t have any hobbies, and for the first time, I had something I wanted to do on my own. That is this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I look at the toy piano and Yayoi-chan in turn. I tried to say something, but the words failed to come out of my mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’d like to say something, but I can’t. The sound of Fukase-kun’s piano at the festival still rings in my heart. When I saw him play, I wished I could play like that. Then I too wanted to…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She broke off her words there and tucked her hair behind her ear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I somehow understood what Yayoi-chan was trying to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I tried to open myself up with the piano. I thought I could be honest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was the sound of Yayoi-chan’s hope.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan let out a peep and a “la” sound.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“All of this is because of…… all of this is because of Fukase-kun, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"> <br class="calibre1"/>
<span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s face turned around, her eyes narrowed, her lips softened, and a smile blossomed like a sunflower.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It wasn’t the bad smile that I had seen the other day, but a very natural and beautiful smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the moment I found the real Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan had finally opened up to me, and I was overwhelmed with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was going to have you listen to me when I got better at it… I didn’t think you would come to my house today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“S-sorry…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I never thought that this piano was the reason why Yayoi-chan was absent from school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Playing the piano for me, is that…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I know I’m terrible at it, but I’ll do my best, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan smiled modestly and tucked her hair behind her ear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She put her fingers on the keys of the small piano and glanced at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’ll go, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan then took a deep breath and began to play the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She played a melody with both hands as if she was checking each note.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Pachelbel’s “Canon”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The notes had been cut for beginners and it was very slow, but I could tell that she had practiced hard these past three days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was not very good at it, but the piano that Yayoi-chan played was filled with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is the kind of music you play for someone else….</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Umm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her playing stopped. It was as if she had forgotten the sheet music, and her right hand was wandering about in the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Next is the ‘Re’.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, that’s right. Thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, who was struggling to follow the sheet music, resumed playing. After that, perhaps she had become accustomed to the music, or perhaps because she was no longer nervous, but she smoothly played the whole song to the end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You did it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked embarrassed, but I applauded her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You were very good. I can’t believe you’ve only been playing the piano for three days!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I even took time off from school to practice!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said it jokingly, but it was true, so it wasn’t funny at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then Yayoi-chan turned around and straightened her back toward me sitting on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Our eyes met, and Yayoi-chan blinked twice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wasn’t afraid of making a mistake, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s cheeks were even redder than before, perhaps from the sense of accomplishment she felt after finishing her performance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I wasn’t scared at all because Fukase-kun was listening to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looked at me with a bashful smile, and I looked her in the eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun, you are the best.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan looks me in the eye and speaks with a firm but unwavering smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“So don’t be afraid, Fukase-kun! The failure of the school festival can be a precious memory for both me and Fukase-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan clutched her knees with both hands and her eyes were moist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is what Yayoi-chan wanted to do and what she wanted to tell me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The thought that went into the performance earlier was conveyed through the melody.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san. For me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This was a message to me, who was traumatized by the failure that had dragged me down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan played the piano and told me that she was not afraid of failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Failure is not something to be afraid of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You can’t move forward if you’re afraid of failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I now understand why Yayoi-chan thought it was so cool when she heard me play at the festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So this is what it means when the sound reaches the heart. It’s a performance for someone special.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I bit my lip and thanked her again and again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Thank you for that.” </span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan gave me the biggest smile she could muster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then we laughed out loud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had finally found the real Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was so great, so normal and so happy.</span></p>
