<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 10: Gal and the Bakery</h1>


<p>From the day I walked home with Tsumakawa, a few days had passed.</p>
<p>It was a clear Saturday afternoon, a little past 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your purchase——”</p>

<p>At this moment, I was working part-time at a bakery called ‘Nakamachi’s Bakery’ located about a ten-minute walk from Yono-Honmachi Station.</p>
<p>Why am I working part-time at a local bakery today instead of my usual convenience store job?</p>
<p>To explain that, with the flashback from yesterday.</p>
<p>So, let’s go back to yesterday after school…</p>

<p>——As I was about to head home, exiting the classroom of 1-D.</p>

<p>“Ah, Yoda-kun! Can I talk to you for a moment?”</p>

<p>Nakamachi, who seemed a bit different from when she was in the clubroom, stopped me and made this request.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to bother you on such short notice… but could you work a part-time job at my family’s bakery tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Huh… This is quite sudden, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see, the person who was supposed to work tomorrow suddenly can’t make it… So my dad and the others were trying to find a replacement, but they couldn’t find anyone. That’s why he asked me on LINE earlier to ‘ask a friend’…But the only people I can rely on at school are Yoda-kun and Hina-chan senpai——Please, Yoda-kun!”</p>

<p>To be honest, at first, I was going to refuse.</p>
<p>However, seeing Nakamachi’s troubled expression, I thought less about wanting to help her and more about not wanting to ‘not help’ her for no particular reason.</p>
<p>I felt bad about that, so I ended up agreeing to work.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Yoda-kun! Having friends is truly invaluable, isn’t it? Ehehehe!”</p>
<p>“…It’s not a big deal, Nakamachi. But I feel like there’s a difference in how relaxed you are when you’re in the clubroom versus other times… Could it be that you’re generally more energetic during regular school hours?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No way, that’s not true.”</p>

<p>In response to my question, Nakamachi put on an exaggerated sleepy look and answered like that.</p>
<p>And with that, the brief flashback came to an end!</p>

<p>This is how I now work part-time for a day at the bakery owned by Nakamachi’s parents.</p>
<p>My tasks mainly involved bagging bread that customers had purchased and replenishing bread that had run out, along with various other miscellaneous work.</p>
<p>From 9 in the morning to now… around 2 in the afternoon, with an hour break in between, I had been working rather consistently.</p>
<p>And so, after seeing off the last customer inside the store and catching my breath, Nakamachi, wearing an apron with the logo of ‘Nakamachi’s Bakery’ hurried over from the register with small steps and said to me,</p>

<p>“Yoda-kun, thank you so much today. You’ve been a huge help!”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don’t feel like I’m helping you much since I can only help you so little at a moment’s notice.”</p>

<p>“That’s not true. I think Yoda-kun is working so hard that I feel like I don’t have to work at all…In fact, I don’t want to work anymore. I want to leave all the work to you, Yoda-kun, and just relax. I want Yoda-kun to work for my part as well…”</p>
<p>“Such straightforwardly self-indulgent words… But it’s unexpected. Nakamachi, you’re really lively and active when you’re doing this job. To me, the only image I had of Nakamachi was her lazing around in the clubroom, so I was quite surprised…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha! I’ve been helping out at the shop since I was a kid, so I had no choice but to learn the work. … Ugh, the real me is the one you see in the Manga Research Club room… If I could, even during my part-time job, I’d want to lie down. I’d lay a futon on the floor and greet customers while lying down, saying, ‘Welcome! Today’s recommendation is Bacon Pain d’Epi bread!’ “</p>
<p>“What kind of bakery is that? The waitress is so arrogant.”</p>
<p>“Even bakeries need to reform their working style, you know?”</p>
<p>“That level of reform hasn’t happened in any industry.”</p>

<p>Finally, we had a moment when it wasn’t busy, so while we were having a casual chat, a clattering sound echoed, and a new customer entered the store.</p>
<p>So, reflexively, I said, ‘Welcome——!’ as I looked toward the entrance, and there stood…</p>

<p>“Huh…? Wait, Nakamachi-chan and… Yoda?”</p>

<p>It was Tsumakawa-san in casual wear with conservative makeup, and next to her was a slightly older-looking gal, dressed as stylishly as she was, with heavier makeup than Tsumakawa-san, standing side by side.</p>
<p>Shocked by the sight, I let out a puzzled ‘Huh…’ And then, amid the sudden situation that baffled both me and Tsumakawa, Nakamachi cheerfully said,</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the gal duo from before! Welcome!”</p>
<p>“…No, what’s going on? I just came with Mama to buy lunch from my favorite bakery… huh?”</p>

<p>I… I was left flabbergasted. I looked once again at the gal beside Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>There stood a young-looking woman who I could only see as her older sister.</p>
<p>Mama…?</p>

<p>“Hehe. I’m glad you called it ‘my favorite bakery.’ This place is actually my mom and dad’s bakery.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Oh, I see! So ‘Nakamachi’s Bakery’ is Nakamachi-chan’s parents’ shop. And… so? Why is Yoda working here?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, that’s because…”</p>
<p>“Because the usual part-timer suddenly couldn’t make it, so I asked him to help just for today. Yoda-kun is kind, so he agreed to help me out. Right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah… Well, something like that…”</p>
<p>“…Hmm, is that so?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa frowned slightly as she said this, looking me up and down in my apron.</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt like a frog being stared down by a snake.</p>
<p>I wonder why? Just as I was wondering, Tsumakawa’s mother, who was next to her, blinked her eyes like a child and alternately glanced at Tsumakawa-san and me.</p>

<p>“Miona… Is this the boy you’ve been talking about a lot lately, Yoda-kun?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Mom… Can you not say unnecessary things?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see… That’s what’s going on. Well then, leave it to Mama!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san’s mother who apparently looked like a high school student from any angle—struck a cute pose towards Tsumakawa, then started walking towards us.</p>


<p>Tsumakawa-san’s mother—who apparently looked like a high school student from any angle—struck a cute pose towards Tsumakawa, then started walking towards us.</p>
<p>After that, Tsumakawa’s Mother, who stopped in front of me and Nakamachi, cheerfully said,</p>

<p>“Hello there, I’m Miona’s mom, Reika. You’re both Miona’s friends, right? Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Uh.. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“By the way, are you Ryosuke? Surprisingly cute face you have. Please continue to get along well with my daughter, Miona, okay? She has lots of friends, but she tends to get clingy with the ones she really likes. You might find her annoying eventually, but please don’t dislike her.”</p>
<p>“…Hey, Mama?”</p>
<p>“But seriously, isn’t this kid stylish? She takes after me. She’ll become quite a beautiful woman. If you’re interested, how about you two get together? Then you can show me the cute face of my grandchild!”</p>
<p>“Wait, Mama!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa tried to reign in her mom, who was getting involved with me and snapped at her.</p>

<p>What can I say, it was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Her appearance, the way she talks, her gestures—everything about her radiates a sunny energy.</p>
<p>She’s not just a sun-kissed extrovert; she is the sun itself. It’s as if I could get sunburned just by looking at her…</p>
<p>As I was thinking that, the overwhelmingly radiant Tsumakawa’s Mom smiled while scratching her cheek and turned her attention to Nakamachi, asking,</p>

<p>“By the way, Nakamachi-chan, I’m feeling a bit hungry. Is there any bread you’d recommend today? If you don’t mind, could you tell me?”</p>

<p>As Tsumakawa’s Mom said this, she naturally put her arm around Nakamachi’s shoulder and led her to where the bread was displayed.</p>
<p>Nakamachi responded, ‘Today’s recommendation? Well, everything is recommended, but today’s special is Dad’s—’, and started explaining the different types of bread to Tsumakawa’s Mom.</p>

<p>” ” …. ” “</p>

<p>And then, the only ones left in the scene were Tsumakawa-san and me.</p>
<p>In the slightly awkward atmosphere, she suddenly took her smartphone out of her bag and started reading an e-book.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I couldn’t help but ask her.</p>

<p>“…Why did you suddenly start reading an e-book…?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I was feeling a bit annoyed, so I’m just reading one of my favorite light novels to cheer myself up.”</p>
<p>“Huh, annoyed…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, reading light novels is fun. It helps relieve stress. This way, I might be able to swallow back things I wanted to say because I got ticked off. Maybe.”</p>

<p>Saying this in a monotonous tone, Tsumakawa-san continued reading her e-book on her phone.</p>
<p>But after a while, she let out a sigh and said, ‘Sigh… But still, reading this in my current mood might be disrespectful to the author…I guess I’ll ask him…’</p>
<p>After muttering that, she closed her phone and then whispered in my ear:</p>


<p>“You’re not cheating, are you?”</p>
<p>“Wha——? How can I cheat on you when I’m not even dating anyone… What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>I looked at Tsumakawa-san in genuine surprise, and she seemed somewhat troubled, lowering her face gloomily.</p>

<p>“That’s right. After all, Yoda, you haven’t been cheating or anything… And yet, I… Sigh… we’re probably not even a thing…”</p>
<p>“W-What happened all of a sudden…?”</p>
<p>“…To begin with, Yoda isn’t even Miona’s boyfriend or anything like that… But why? Right now, I’m just feeling so down. More like, I’m just plain annoyed for real…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san said that while playing with her nail-adorned fingers and wearing a pained expression.</p>
<p>There was something akin to remorse in her demeanor.</p>
<p>Because she’s naturally a kind girl, holding such ugly emotions might not suit her.</p>
<p>Maybe she feels a sense of self-loathing towards herself for harboring such feelings despite the fact that she shouldn’t.</p>
<p>So, her confession slightly resembled something a sinner might confess to a priest in a church.</p>

<p>“I mean, Yoda is just helping Nakamachi-chan, right? BBut even if that’s all it is, I keep overthinking——Is that really all there is to it? I’m seriously thinking about it… Could it be that Yoda helped Nakamachi-chan because she’s Nakamachi-chan? Maybe Nakamachi-chan wanted your help because you’re Yoda… Thinking about things like that really makes me dislike myself…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“I don’t have the right to tell you not to be with another girl… I mean, I don’t go out alone with guys, but I hang out in groups that include a few male friends sometimes, and yet, to demand only that from Yoda, isn’t that too unfair? It’s strange, especially when we’re not even in that kind of relationship…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Ah, am I talking too much? Sorry… But if I don’t say it, I might not be able to stand it anymore——Hey, please don’t get too close to other girls. If Yoda wants to do something intimate with Nakamachi-chan, tell me, okay? Whatever you want to do with her, things you can’t do with her——I’ll do them all in her place… So, please, just keep your desires only for me, okay?”</p>
<p>“T-Tsumakawa-san…?”</p>
<p>“——or something like that? I’m just saying… Ahaha….”</p>

<p>With a soft and emotionally unstable voice, she said so, and in the end, she forced out a laugh that seemed somewhat forced.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was a series of statements that left me at a loss for how to react.</p>
<p>Could it be that she really likes me a lot?</p>

<p>However, it feels more like a kind of ‘possessiveness’ rather than genuine affection…</p>
<p>It’s similar to how I feel when my older sister brings a boyfriend home, a kind of ‘unpleasantness’…</p>
<p>As I was pondering this, Tsumakawa blushed, straightened her posture, looked at me again, and continued.</p>

<p>“Well, something as embarrassing as this is definitely something I could never say to Yoda!”</p>
<p>“Uh, Tsumakawa-san? Weren’t you just confessing all your feelings a moment ago?”</p>
<p>“Ughh, I’m rambling… I’m totally babbling right now… But well, it’s not like I’m lying, so it’s okay… While it’s true that I’m rambling, all of it is from the heart….Just know that this is what I’ve been thinking, okay?”</p>

<p>Saying words like that, Tsumakawa-san playfully hit my shoulder as usual.</p>


<p>Saying words like that, Tsumakawa-san playfully hit my shoulder as usual.</p>
<p>However, her punch today lacked the usual strength, and it was more like a gentle tap, making a soft sound.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Is she getting a bit too fixated on someone like me…?</p>
<p>If Tsumakawa-san were to have a boyfriend, she’d likely be quite possessive… She might end up erasing all the contacts of other girls from his phone.</p>
<p>——No, stop! I didn’t back up any data, so please don’t delete my contacts!</p>

<p>…Uh, I apologize for interrupting the flow of the narrative, but I need to correct myself here.</p>
<p>Earlier, Ryosuke Yoda reacted as if he had multiple girls’ contacts in his phone, but that is incorrect.</p>
<p>My phone doesn’t have any contacts of girls other than Tsumakawa-san…I was just trying to sound cool…I sincerely apologize for that.</p>

<p>And thus, the conversation with Tsumakawa was interrupted because Tsumakawa’s Mom ran over to us, waving her hand.</p>
<p>Looking far younger than a typical mother, she approached us with a tray of several types of bread, innocently striking up a conversation with Tsumakawa-san.</p>

<p>“How’s this? Miona. I got Himeko-chan’s recommendation, and I also picked a few things. What else do you want?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I mean, I don’t eat more than four pieces of bread… This should be enough…”</p>
<p>“Huh? You usually eat more than that. You really like the bread here, and even though I’ve told you that you might gain weight if you eat like that, you still eat at least six, right? Don’t hold back just because Ryosuke is here; choose what you like.”</p>
<p>“Hey, shut up…!”</p>

<p>With a smile, Tsumakawa’s Mom exposed her daughter’s appetite, causing Tsumakawa-san to blush deeply and lightly hit her shoulder.</p>
<p>This parent and child have a friend-like relationship… It’s kind of heartwarming…</p>

<p>After that, Tsumakawa’s Mom added two more pieces of bread to their tray and took them to the cash register.</p>
<p>While Nakamachi was processing the payment, as I moved to replenish the bread that had run out, Tsumakawa suddenly grabbed the hem of my apron and quietly asked.</p>

<p>“Hey. Yoda, what time do you finish today?”</p>
<p>“Today, I’m scheduled to finish at around 5 PM…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“…Considering you asked, isn’t that attitude a bit too much?”</p>

<p>As such conversation was happening between Tsumakawa and me, Tsumakawa’s Mom finished the payment, and the mother and daughter left the store.</p>
<p>As they were leaving, Tsumakawa’s Mom waved at us, saying, ‘See you later, Ryosuke, Himeko-chan! Come over to our place sometime!” with a friendly tone.</p>
<p>However, her daughter just ‘glanced at us and didn’t wave like she usually did.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Well then, thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thanks for your hard work…”</p>
<p>“Thank you! Really, thank you so much!”</p>

<p>After Tsumakawa and her mom left the shop, about three hours later—after 5 PM.</p>
<p>With the number of customers having considerably decreased, Nakamachi’s mother told me, ‘It’s fine for you to leave now.’</p>
<p>I said goodbye to both her parents and was about to leave the store.</p>
<p>But then, still wearing her apron, Nakamachi came up to me.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g15.png" alt="" />

<p>“Thank you so much today, Yoda-kun! Next time, when my desire to thank you overpowers my desire to slack off…aside from your salary, I’ll also give you a personal thank-you, okay?”</p>
<p>“If you’re just giving a half-hearted thank you out of obligation, I don’t need it!”</p>
<p>“Hehe. …But really, thank you. Honestly, I don’t have many friends… So, when I asked you yesterday, I was really happy when Yoda-kun accepted me because I was afraid that I wouldn’t have anyone else to rely on if you didn’t accept me——So when you agreed to help, I was really happy. Yoda-kun is a very reliable person!”</p>
<p>“N-No… I mean, I just helped a little…”</p>
<p>“No matter if it’s a little or not, I was happy that you really helped me when I asked for it. ——See you later! Let’s laze around together in the clubroom again soon.”</p>
<p>“The clubroom isn’t meant for lazing around, you know… anyway, see you later.”</p>

<p>With Nakamachi in a cheerful mood seeing me off, I left the store.</p>
<p>Outside, the sky was already dyed a reddish color, and I felt the end of the day.</p>
<p>…I’ve been working the whole day today. But well, at least I got paid for it, and now I can buy some light novels or something.</p>

<p>While lost in thought, as I stretched my body widely, I felt a gaze coming from somewhere.</p>
<p>As I looked around… I noticed a girl sitting on the sidewalk curb, looking at me.</p>
<p>Moreover, upon closer inspection, the girl turned out to be none other than Tsumakawa-san, the white gal who should have left the store a few hours ago.</p>

<p>“Uh… Tsumakawa-san?”</p>

<p>Surprised by the unexpected sight, I involuntarily let out a voice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tsumakawa-san, who noticed I had come out of the store, came running towards me.</p>
<p>She then stood in front of me, gave a small bashful smile, and lightly touched my shoulder while saying, ‘Hey.’</p>

<p>“….Tsumakawa-san, what are you doing here…?”</p>
<p>“Uh, just passing by coincidentally, so I thought I’d say hi.”</p>
<p>“It feels more like you were lying in wait for me to finish work.”</p>
<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter. Yoda, you’re taking the train back, right? Let’s walk to the station together.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa stood next to me.</p>
<p>…I don’t get it. Why did Tsumakawa-san wait for me to finish my shift here?</p>
<p>While I was pondering this question, she lowered her gaze to the ground and started speaking.</p>

<p>“My house is near here, close to ‘Nakamachi’s Bakery.’ But I never expected that the Nakamachi-chan you introduced me to would turn out to be the daughter of that bakery…”</p>
<p>“Ah, so Tsumakawa-san’s house is quite close to here… In that case, it’s not surprising to pass by this area.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s not surprising, right? So, I just happened to pass by, yes…”</p>

<p>Having such a conversation, Tsumakawa-san and I walked side by side on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>——Normally, the sound of asphalt scraping against shoes that beat an irregular rhythm wouldn’t bother me so much. On my side, sneakers; on hers, heels.</p>
<p>Only the distinct sounds of the two different types of footsteps resonated from beneath our feet.</p>


<p>Only the distinct sounds of the two different types of footsteps resonated from beneath our feet.</p>

<p>” ” …… ” “</p>

<p>In this way, an awkward silence fell between us.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed it before because she usually keeps the conversation going, but I guess this is what happens when Tsumakawa-san goes quiet…</p>
<p>Also, for some reason, she had changed her outfit from what she was wearing a few hours ago (a white knit dress) to a black camisole, distressed jeans, white boots, and a short white cardigan.</p>
<p>Does she change outfits like this within a single day?</p>
<p>Isn’t that a lot of laundry, and wouldn’t that be quite a task for her mom?</p>
<p>While thinking about such things, Tsumakawa-san suddenly spoke up with a somewhat awkward expression.</p>

<p>“…Light novel Shiritori, starting with ‘Ri’ ‘Ryuuou no Oshigoto! (The Ryuo’s Work Is Never Done!)’ “</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly starting a mysterious game? What’s up with her…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s Yoda’s turn… light novel shiritori…”</p>
<p>“Ah, right. It’s my turn, huh… Let’s see, ‘To’? Is there anything with ‘To’… Ah! ——’Tokidoki bosotto Roshiago de dereru tonari no ārya-san (The Neighboring Aarya-san who Sometimes Acts Affectionate and Murmuring in Russian.)!’ “</p>
<p>“… Finished?”</p>
<p>“… Sorry. I actually made a mistake just now…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>(TN : A player who plays a word ending with ‘N’ (ん) loses the game, as no Japanese word begins with that character.)</p>

<p>And once again, silence fell between the two of us.</p>
<p>…What’s with this awkwardness? It’s painful and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>As I was thinking that, Tsumakawa, who was beside me, suddenly let out a big sigh, ‘Sighhhh~.</p>
<p>Could it be that she’s disappointed with my shiritori mistake…?</p>
<p>With that worry in mind, she shook her head from side to side and then continued with a relieved expression.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s impossible for me to keep hiding my feelings and stay around you like usual, Yoda. So, I’ll just say it. Yeah, I was waiting for you after your shift ended…Of course, I heard that you finish at 5 PM, so I stayed home until then… From a little before 5 PM, I was waiting for you in front of the bakery.”</p>
<p>“W-Why would you do something like that?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>As I asked her, Tsumakawa-san quietly stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>So, I also stopped walking to match her pace.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa looked at my face for a moment, then blushed, averted her gaze, and then spoke her mind.</p>
<p>Her words were spun in a voice that was somewhat uncharacteristically shy.</p>

<p>“Actually, um, I didn’t want the last girl you were with today to be Nakamachi-chan… I just didn’t want that…”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>

<p>Not really understanding what she meant, I asked that back instinctively.</p>
<p>In response, Tsumakawa’s cheeks flushed intensely as if letting off steam, and she quickly turned her face away from mine.</p>
<p>With the setting sun illuminating her features, her profile resembled a ripened apple, glowing in a deep shade of red.</p>

<p>“…Ugh, gross! I’m seriously so gross! Why do I even feel like this?! I don’t get it! This is way more embarrassing than just being jealous! And yet, why did I wait for Yoda like this? I don’t know, I felt like I’d hate myself if I didn’t wait…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Um, Tsumakawa-san? Honestly, I really don’t understand what you’re talking about…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you don’t have to understand, Yoda. Because this feeling…I just want to keep it to myself. I don’t want sympathy from you or anyone else. This is the kind of emotion I want to treasure, something that’s not meant to be understood by anyone else but me… Well, I guess it’s too girly and gross, though! Ugh!”</p>

<p>She exclaimed like that and then crouched down on the spot, hiding her reddened face with both hands.</p>
<p>She’s suddenly getting angry at the bakery, then embarrassed, and now she’s crouching down like this… She’s really emotionally unstable, this gal.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>In essence, I found myself even more unsure about what Tsumakawa thinks of me…at the very least, I don’t think she hates me.</p>
<p>I might not be able to become her friend, but she seemed to think of me as a friend—But if that’s the case, isn’t she showing a bit too much attachment to me, a ‘just friend’?</p>

<p>As I pondered that, I arrived at a hypothesis… Perhaps Tsumakawa is the type of person who tends to get attached to her close friends, not just me.</p>
<p>In other words, I’m not the only special one here. It’s not about me, but rather, Tsumakawa tends to get like this with friends she’s close to.</p>

<p>Once I realized this, something in the depths of my heart felt a bit lighter.</p>
<p>Real-life girls are scary because I can’t understand them, but by interpreting her actions through my own perspective like this, I could finally find a bit of relief——</p>

<p>While I was lost in thought like that, Tsumakawa, who had been crouching down, suddenly stood up and urged me, ‘Hey, let’s hurry and go to the station.’</p>
<p>It was Tsumakawa who had initially suddenly stopped…</p>
<p>Silently protesting inwardly that she had stopped first, we started walking towards the station again.</p>
<p>At that moment, she spoke in a volume just barely audible to me.</p>

<p>“Why is it that only with Yoda, things end up like this…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>——My conclusion, which had just started forming, crumbled with a clatter.</p>
<p>It seemed that truly understanding the rare combination of an otaku and a gal was going to take at least another ten years…</p>
<p>I wish someone would publish a book that covers all things about gals, like the ‘Gal Instruction Manual.’</p>
<p>Otherwise, I’ll never truly understand Tsumakawa-san… And then, without much significant conversation, she and I arrived at the nearest Yono-Honmachi Station.</p>
<p>It seemed that Tsumakawa-san had indeed just brought me this far.</p>
<p>As she watched me enter the ticket gate, she turned towards me, flashing a gal peace sign.</p>

<p>“Well then, see you later! Oh, by the way, come help out at my family’s bakery sometime too!”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard that your family runs a bakery.”</p>

<p>Upon receiving my retort, she laughed joyfully and then turned on her heel to head back the way we came.</p>
<p>Watching her do that, I found myself pondering once again why Tsumakawa-san had waited for me in front of the bakery just to walk this short way together with me—</p>

<p>『Actually, um, I didn’t want the last girl you were with today to be Nakamachi-chan… I just didn’t want that…』</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>The words that Tsumakawa-san unexpectedly spilled out keep echoing in my head.</p>
<p>In the end, I didn’t quite grasp the true meaning behind what she said, but one thing I understood even without fully comprehending her words was that when she said those words, she had a slightly embarrassed look on her face, resembling a girl in love——and it was adorable.</p>
