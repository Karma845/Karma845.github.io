<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 10 - The True Yayoi-chan</h1>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On my way home back from Kinoshita’s house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I boarded the monorail from Johoku Station, all I could think about in agony was Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan is holding herself back, she’s not able to do the things she really wants to do. It is the same with her not making any friends in class.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She’s holding herself back purely due to her work as an agent, which she </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">doesn’t </span></i><span class="calibre8">want to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I guess it’s the same for me, too, not being able to do the things I want to do…</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I held on to the strap, I looked at my reflection in the window and remembered what had happened just six months ago. I had looked this pathetic on that day, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the day of the freshman school festival.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Every year at the Otomachi High School Festival, it was customary for alumni to actively participate in the club presentations. This freedom was a characteristic of the Otomachi Festival.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Last year, a graduate was supposed to participate in the gymnasium as a special guest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayo Shiraishi, a soprano singer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After graduating from Otomachi High School, she went on to an exceptional music college and is now a professional singer, she’s active in operas and various concerts. This was her first triumphant return to her alma mater, and she was the talk of the town amongst every student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">One week before the festival, however, things changed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The music teacher who was supposed to play the piano had injured her right hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">For some reason, I was asked to fill in for her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">In fact, Mayo-senpai was a student of my mother’s piano class, and I knew her, too, though we were not so close in age.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki-kun, are you still playing the piano?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayo-senpai contacted me through my mother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She was three years older than me, and her piano skills had been outstanding ever since we took piano lessons together in elementary school. My mother, who’s also a teacher, immediately recognized Mayo’s talent and even introduced her to a more famous piano school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, Mayo-senpai had no intention of concentrating on the piano and had decided to pursue vocal music in the future instead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I remember the first time I heard Mayo sing, I was astonished. I felt her aura emanating from her whole body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The song she was going to sing at the festival was a Donaudi song, which was not a difficult song to sing with a piano accompaniment. (TLN: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Donaudy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre pcalibre1 pcalibre3">Stefano Donaudy was an Italian composer. Born in Palermo to a French father and an Italian mother, he was active in the 1890s and early 20th century, at a time when Palermo enjoyed a period of relative splendor under the influx of rich Anglo-Sicilian families such as the Florios and Whitakers.</a>)</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I thought Satsuki-kun could play this kind of song.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I checked the score and it looked like I could practice and play in a week.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s nothing much. I’m good at playing the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I readily agreed. But I had no idea at the time that these words would come to weigh heavily on me later on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said, “That’s very encouraging. Then, I’m counting on you, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayo-senpai smiled at me with satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was confident in my piano skills and eager to test my abilities too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My classmates didn’t know that I played the piano, and I had this cheap fantasy that this festival would make me a little popular.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Maybe I also had an ulterior motive of wanting to show Mayo-senpai how cool I was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As I practiced hard until the festival performance, I was able to play without any problems. In my mind’s eye, I had a perfect performance, and I could see the audience in the gym applauding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But the result was a disaster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as I went on stage, my eyes went completely white. To be more precise, I lost all color.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had never played the piano in a big concert before. My mother was a piano teacher, and I had been playing ever since I was a child, so I was proud to say that I was reasonably good at it. In fact, the students at my mother’s piano lessons would often take a glance at me and say, “As expected of the teacher’s son,” and I believed them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I thought it was lame to attend recitals, so I continued to play alone. To me, that was the coolest thing ever, being a solitary pianist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had the confidence, but not the experience. It was my first time playing in front of a packed house like this, and it was inevitable that I would be nervous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before I knew it, I was sitting at the piano, and before I knew it, Mayo-senpai was also on stage. I didn’t even hear the applause from the audience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayo-senpai whispered to me, and I tried my best to smile in response. I was so nervous that I couldn’t speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The keyboard in front of me felt so far away that I could not reach it even if I reached out my hand. When I frantically touched it, it was so cold and everything was so different from usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had been playing the piano by myself for a long time. I thought that if there was only me and the piano, the world was essentially complete. But that day, it was as if the piano was rejecting me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I realized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wasn’t playing the piano for anyone to listen to. I had only been playing it for myself. I hadn’t imagined to whom I wanted to deliver this sound to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Suddenly, a sense of loneliness overtook me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The piano in front of me, Mayo-senpai, and the audience were all moving away from me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t put my heart into the performance that had started before I knew it. My head and fingertips were not connected at all. It was like watching a video of someone else’s performance on YouTube.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Ah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I made a fingering mistake and played the wrong note. This triggered the sheet music to fly off and I stopped playing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The audience was buzzing, but I didn’t hear anything. There was no room for that in my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There were only my ten unmoving fingers and the eighty-eight keys that were out of tune standing still in front of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t remember much after that. I found myself sitting on a pipe chair offstage, clutching a plastic bottle of water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After I failed, Mayo-senpai, who sensed something was wrong, apparently sang the song out in a cappella.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She said, “Thank you, Satsuki-kun. You were good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After the performance was over, Mayo followed up with that, but it didn’t make me feel any better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had been so confident in my piano skills, but I had ruined it all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had no face to show to Mayo-senpai, and I couldn’t even apologize to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was just too depressed to apologize. But it was true that I had caused her trouble, and I wanted to know her true feelings, so I used psychometry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">‘Hahh… I was so happy to make a triumphant return to my alma mater too.</span></i><span class="calibre8">‘</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">What I heard then was Mayo-senpai’s deep sigh and disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not Mayo-senpai’s fault. The actuality was that the concert was destroyed by an amateur like me, it’s only natural to feel that way. She trusted me and selected me, but I didn’t return the favor back properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It wasn’t just Mayo-senpai. I used psychometry on my teacher and classmates as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The teacher said, “Good job,” but what I really heard from her heart was, ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">It was still too heavy a load for Fukase.</span></i><span class="calibre8">’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My classmates praised me, saying, “I didn’t know you could play the piano. It’s amazing,” but the truth is, ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">You were failing so badly</span></i><span class="calibre8">‘.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That day, all I could do was run away from the gymnasium.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After that day, I stopped playing the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t play it at home at all, and even Sanae thinks I’m acting quite strange these days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It’s not that I dislike the piano, and even now, during class, I can still move my fingers spontaneously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">However, I couldn’t bring myself to actually play it. Instinctively, I avoided the piano.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This regret that lingers in my heart has remained with me for a very long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">…Hah</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As soon as I arrived at the nearest station and got off the train, the sigh I had been holding back had leaked out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even now, I remember that mistake vividly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the same as when Yayoi-chan-chan had Donaudi’s CD at the Power Records.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was all a failure brought on by my pride and carelessness. If I had practiced a bit more, that wouldn’t have happened. If it was just me who was embarrassed it would be fine, but the fact that I had caused trouble for Mayo-senpai weighed heavily on me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I knew that sneaking a peek at people’s feelings through psychometry wouldn’t do me any good.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I just wanted forgiveness. I wanted to believe that it wasn’t my fault.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But after hearing Mayo-senpai’s true feelings and sighs, I just ran away. Even now, I continue to run away from everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t even play the piano that I loved so much anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder if Yayoi-chan has always felt this way too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">On the way home from the station.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I want to do something for Yayoi-chan, who thinks I’m cool.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know that life is no fun when you can no longer do the things you want to do.</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The next morning, I took a small deep breath before entering the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Inside the classroom, it was business as per usual. A group of people chatting in a group. A group of boys frantically working on an assignment due today. A girl on day duty carrying a vase of flowers with a new water container. Some of them were scribbling on the blackboard behind them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And Yayoi-chan was sitting by the window reading a book as always.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Everything was a very familiar scene in this second-year seventh-grade classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Nobody talks to Yayoi-chan anymore. Her ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Stay away from me</span></i><span class="calibre8">’ aura was so well recognized by her classmates that even Mayama was scared of her now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I also avoided talking to Yayoi-chan in the classroom. I thought it was for Yayoi-chan’s agent’s sake that I shouldn’t do so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But it wasn’t. Yesterday, after hearing Uzuki’s story, my view about her had changed completely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan doesn’t really </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">want </span></i><span class="calibre8">to be alone. She’s just holding back from the things she wants to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Alright.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked at her back, put on one of my spirits, and entered the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then I walked in a straight path to Yayoi-chan’s seat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Good morning, Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I greeted Yayoi-chan as I approached her desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, good morning?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan reflexively returned my greeting, but immediately blushed and returned her gaze back to her book. She seemed surprised that she had even reacted to my words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Our classmates also seemed shocked that Yayoi-chan had returned the greeting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The classroom was quiet and still. I returned to my desk as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s wrong, Satsuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama, who had arrived unusually early, immediately came up to my desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oh, Mayama. Good morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put my textbooks in my bag on my desk, and responded to Mayama who looked like a pigeon that had gotten hit by a peashooter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not a good morning. Why’d you greet Kinoshita-san so suddenly?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama points to Yayoi-chan at the window with his thumb in a hushed voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s no big deal. You’re overreacting just because I greeted her just now. We’re classmates, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, well, I guess we are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama still looked like he wanted to say something back to me, but he scratched his head and returned to his seat. It was kind of interesting that our positions seemed to have reversed from the last time we spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted to do something for Yayoi-chan, who was holding herself back from doing what she wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t believe a hundred percent of what Uzuki-chan had told me, and I don’t know what the right answer to the scenario is either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">As for her, Yayoi-chan may have her own family situation to worry about, and I can’t just simply tell her to quit her job. I don’t know what Yayoi-chan wants to even do right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So, for the time being, I won’t let Yayoi-chan be alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wanted her to be able to enjoy her time at school without being overwhelmed by everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It may only be a small effort, but I started working to create an environment where I could get along with Yayoi-chan and not have to force myself on her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was very enthusiastic about this plan… but it wasn’t going to be that easy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">After all, I was up against the formidable Yayoi-chan. Her ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">stay away from me</span></i><span class="calibre8">’ aura was no joke at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was no way that my greeting would immediately shorten the distance between me and my classmates, and in fact, Yayoi-chan had just become even more wary of me. Now her aura was even more prevalent, and if I approached her carelessly, I was sure I would be cut to pieces.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">And then lunch break had arrived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Not wanting to give up at this point, I headed to Yayoi-chan’s seat to have lunch together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kino-……”</span></p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Slam!</span></i><span class="calibre8"> Was it first for me to call out to her or for Yayoi-chan to get up from her seat?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan left the classroom with her lunch box. It was as if she was running away from me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I stared at her back, and slowly made my way back to my seat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I wonder if the fact that she went home yesterday is still lingering in her memory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I’d try to gradually shorten the distance between us in this classroom, but was I in too much of a hurry?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki, let’s eat lunch.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama moved to my desk with a chair, carrying a loaf of bread from a convenience store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">‘You tried to ask Kinoshita-san out, but she got away, didn’t she?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Apparently, Mayama had seen me. The part where she completely ignored me and rejected me, instead of me asking her out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“That’s right…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You didn’t deny it today? Did you eat something weird?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama was surprised when I easily admitted it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, she’s been alone for a long time. It’s been more than two weeks since we started this class, and no one even talks to her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“She doesn’t want to talk to us, so it can’t be helped, can it? That ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">don’t approach</span></i><span class="calibre8">’ aura can’t speak to anyone after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Even Mayama, who’s already the center of the class, is reluctant to speak to her. He was very excited to talk to her at first, but then she ignored him again and again, which was very hard on him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m sure Kinoshita-san’s attitude is one thing, I think Kinoshita-san is actually lonely, too”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I know Yayoi-chan’s circumstances as an agent, so her feelings about her classmates are a little different.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I’m struggling with Yayoi-chan’s communication skills as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Then Mayama smirked and giggled as he opened a bag of bread.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What’s with that smirk…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, I just thought that it was unusual.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Satsuki worrying about someone like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Mayama pointed out, and I frowned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You always look like you don’t care about anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve never been one to actively enter into other people’s minds because of my psychometric abilities.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not worried, I just wish we could all get along better. Because I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be in the same classroom, ignoring someone and being ignored as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“On the first day of school, when I tried to talk to her, she told me to leave her alone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">There was another reason for that, but that was a long time ago now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know if it bothers her if someone talks to her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Talking in the classroom could interfere with her work as an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I am beginning to wonder if what I am trying to do is really for Yayoi-chan’s benefit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Don’t be discouraged. If you fail, you can start all over again. Only you can reset your failures.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Beside me, who was eating a fried egg in my lunch box and had no appetite, Mayama opened the third bag of bread and said,</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No one knows how Kinoshita-san truly feels, so you just have to do it over and over again until you understand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san and how she feels…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I felt like my heart was being pounded out of my chest by Mayama’s words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve been taking the liberty of psychometrically peeking into Yayoi-chan’s feelings, and even asking Uzuki-chan about the situation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I just know about Yayoi-chan’s secret.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That’s before there was any communication between us whatsoever. I was just one-sidedly peeking into someone else’s life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the same with Mayo-senpai. I was cheating using my psychometry. As a result, I ran away from her when I found out the truth. If I had talked to Mayo-senpai properly at that time, I might have still been playing the piano today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">All along, I was just trying to seek results all on my own, without facing anyone else properly. And I had come to the conclusion of failure all by myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ve never been able to face Yayoi-chan properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Yeah, you’re right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I put down my chopsticks and stood up at Mayama’s casual comment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Oi, what’s up, Satsuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Right. Either I do it or I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I clenched my left fist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, if you don’t wanna eat this, I’ll have your lunch on your behalf.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I raised my thumbs toward the hungry Mayama and went after Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m going to face her head on and talk to her properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was not so difficult to find Yayoi-chan who ran out of the classroom. All I had to do was look for her in a place where no one else would be around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I found Yayoi-chan on a small bench at the end of the piloti. As expected, there was no one around and she was seated all by herself. She had already finished eating her lunch and was just finishing an after-meal dessert, Éclairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan noticed me, gave up on her dessert, and quickly tried to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, wait a minute! I need to talk to you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I hurriedly approached Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t have anything to say to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan stood up with her back turned to me, her voice very cold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You don’t have to run away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m not running away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then let’s talk about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What did Uzuki say to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…Nothing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was just yesterday when that happened, so it was understandable that Yayoi-chan was suspicious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Finally, Yayoi-chan turned around. Her eyes, which would normally be staring at me, were wandering about in the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I was curious because you’re always alone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not up to you to decide that, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She held her cheeks with both hands and turned away again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Today, instead of glaring at me, she wouldn’t even look at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Does it bother you if I talk to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“It’s not like that, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then what is it? We’re classmates after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan kept her back to me and didn’t answer anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Why don’t you talk to everyone a bit more?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“…I don’t know anything about you, Fukase-kun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The reply, which was not an answer, was laced with bitterness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You don’t really want to be an agent, do you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">You don’t want to be alone in the classroom either, do you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">How much easier it would have been to hear that from her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I guess it’s the same for Yayoi-chan too. She suffers because she can’t reveal her secret. She’s bound by the secret of being an agent and is unable to be honest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Hey, do you remember? Here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I turned to Yayoi-chan’s back and tried to change the subject.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">She didn’t respond, but I continued speaking, believing she was listening to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We met here, right? The both of us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was the afternoon of last year’s festival that we had met.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan’s class had a stall at the café here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">It was Yayoi-chan who was manning the stall at the time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“We didn’t talk, or rather, we didn’t really have a conversation either, so Kinoshita-san probably doesn’t remember it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was so nervous about meeting Yayoi-chan for the first time that I scattered the contents of my wallet all over her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The wooden bench that Yayoi-chan had been sitting on earlier had been placed just where that café had been.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I remember… Fukase-kun, dropped some coins.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yeah, that’s right… I’m a dork, aren’t I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"> Yayoi-chan’s shoulder also shook a little bit, which made me feel relieved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, too, gazes nostalgically at that bench. The bench on which our gazes meet is where it all began.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I touched Yayoi-chan’s hand to catch some coins, and did some psychometry by accident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">That was the beginning of it all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“You were alone then too, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I returned to this topic, Yayoi-chan didn’t reply back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was not going to get anywhere at this point, so I went in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan tried to escape, but I blocked her path.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita-san, are you sure you want to stay the way you are? Do you really want to be alone forever? Isn’t there anything you want to do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan kept her face down, she was not even glaring at me, she just kept avoiding my gaze the whole time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I don’t want to see Yayoi-chan looking sad, and it pains me to think that I was the cause of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t know anything about Kinoshita-san. I don’t know </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">anything </span></i><span class="calibre8">about you, so I want you to tell me more about yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I asked her softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">At that moment, a gust of wind came rushing through the pilotis.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">If the real Yayoi-chan is on the other side of this wind, wait for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’ll come get you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“……I just want to know the real Kinoshita-san.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Before I knew it, Yayoi-chan’s face had turned bright red. Her closed lips were trembling slightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I don’t have anything else I want to do. I’m going to go now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan put her hand on her cheek and ran off, making some unusual clattering sounds on her way back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Yayoi-chan…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">When I couldn’t see her anymore, I mumbled her name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t give up just yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Not for myself, but for someone else. For the first time I was looking for something I could do for someone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The afternoon classes were over while I was thinking about it, and it was the time after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">The classroom was noisy, probably because tomorrow was the beginning of the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Usually I would have no plans for the weekend, I would just end up at home reading books and doing some stuff on the internet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But today was different.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">With a certain resolve in my heart, I headed for Yayoi-chan who was getting ready to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I was going to make my move before Yayoi-chan noticed my presence and ran away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Kinoshita, do you want to go out tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">Hahhh!</span></i><span class="calibre8">“</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan let out a strange sound and jumped up a few centimeters away from her chair.</span></p>

<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">From somewhere, a voice that sounded like a classmate’s scream came from somewhere, and Mayama had been knocked over from his chair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I had just asked Yayoi-chan out in the classroom with dignity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Seriously, what’s up with Fukase today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Does he have a fever? Did he just ask Kinoshita-san out on a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is he trying to die? Is he suicidal?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I’m not!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My classmates whispered about me, worried about something that they don’t need to worry about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“What are you talking about, Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Desperately trying to regain her usual cool, Yayoi-chan squeezed out her voice while touching her hair repeatedly. She was indeed not able to ignore the fact that I had asked her out so openly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“I’m going to go out with you tomorrow. Is that okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“N-no, it’s not okay…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan, as expected, did not push me away and leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Then I’ll be waiting for you at the Hondori station tomorrow at eleven o’clock!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I forcefully made a promise to meet up with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“No, no, you can’t just decide that… on your own.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Is that okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I looked straight at Yayoi-chan, whose eyes were swimming about here and there, and her cheeks immediately began to flush.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Her long eyelashes blinked, and then she gave a small shake of her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“See you tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I promised, and dashed out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">“Fukase-kun?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">My heart was racing at Yayoi-chan’s impatient voice and the screams of my classmates melted away after school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I can’t make her quit as an agent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">But I could create an environment in class where she could get along with everyone normally.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I couldn’t just run away from her because of something I couldn’t see, such as a ‘</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="calibre8">stay away</span></i><span class="calibre8">’ aura. I will take the initiative and break down Yayoi-chan’s barriers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">This is what I can do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">I thought I couldn’t see the moon in the daytime, but that’s just because of the way the light shines around it, making it invisible on its own. I look at it from afar and assume it’s a crescent moon or a half moon, but the moon is always round and its shape never truly changes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">Yayoi-chan is the same. She may not be honest, she may be an agent, but the real Yayoi-chan is always there inside of her. She’s just a normal high school girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">So I will face her head on. No more chasing after her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8">To find the real Yayoi-chan.</span></p>
