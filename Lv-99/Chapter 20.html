<h3>Chapter 20: A Week of Assassination Attempts</h3>

<p>If I’m honest, I didn’t want to be born into a noble family. They often have to learn etiquette and dance, and I don’t like how there are so many lip services in the conversation with nobles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there are also moments where I thought that it’s good to be born as a noble. I get to eat sweets regularly. And the price to eat such a delicious sweet frequently is not something that ordinary people could afford.</p>



<p>Sometimes I bought them myself and sometimes I received it as a gift from the queen and other nobles.</p>







<p>Today I’m going to eat the cookies sent by the queen. The cookies must be tasty since it’s something chosen by the queen.</p>



<p>「Rita, please brew me a cup of tea. 」</p>



<p>「Please wait, my lady. 」</p>



<p>My maid Rita brews a delicious tea, and she does her job perfectly. If only she isn’t on my father’s side, she could be the perfect maid.</p>



<p>I’m so happy that today I can enjoy a good cup of tea with delicious cookies.</p>



<p>&#8230;Oh? I feel the tea tastes different from the usual. The tip of my tongue is tingling, did she change the tea leaves? Perhaps it went bad.</p>



<p>「Hey, is this the usual tea? 」</p>



<p>「Hai, this is the same tea as usual. 」</p>



<p>It feels like sandpaper on my tongue. I’m satisfied with the sweets that I bought in downtown. I don’t think becoming a noble is suitable for me.</p>







<p>The tea that I drank on the next day tastes strange too. Maybe I’m starting to catch a cold, though I’ve never caught a cold.</p>



<p>「Excuse me, am I speaking with Miss Yumiela? 」</p>



<p>When I was on my way back to my room after school to take a break, I was stopped by a man I’ve never seen.</p>



<p>「Yeah, I’m Yumiela. 」</p>



<p>「My name is Alastor, and I’m from the Magic Tool Development Department. I wanted you to cooperate with magic tools experiment. 」</p>



<p>Even though I don’t have any responsibility to cooperate with him, but I will since I was interested in the tools that were being developed.</p>



<p>「Sure, as long as it doesn’t take too much time. 」</p>



<p>「No, it will be quick. I already prepared an empty classroom over there. 」</p>



<p>The fact that he’s been talking to me told me the experiment would be something like an endurance test. I thought I’d be taken somewhere, but it seems the experiment was done in the school’s classroom.</p>







<p>「It’s a new type of magical handcuffs, and we want to test whether it can stand your power as the strongest in the kingdom. 」</p>



<p>Alastor showed me the magic equipment shaped like handcuffs. The handcuffs are a magic tool that restrains the target’s magic.</p>



<p>He put on the handcuffs on me. I don’t know what it is made from, but I can feel the weight of iron. They are built to be strong, both physically and magically.</p>







<p>A man being alone with a handcuffed schoolgirl in an empty classroom, somehow this looks like a crime scene.</p>



<p>「Should I try to use my magic in this situation? 」</p>



<p>「Yes, please gradually increase the magical output. If the handcuffs can’t stand the magic, I’ll give you a sign to stop. 」</p>



<p>I did as he said, but when I tried to activate my magic a little, nothing happened. Gradually I increased the amount of magical power that I release, but there’s no sign of any change happen.</p>



<p>In the end, I tried to use my magic with all my might, but still, nothing happened. This magic tool is the first one ever to stand my magic.</p>



<p>「This is all I can do. This magic tool is impressive. 」</p>







<p>I can’t hear what Alastor said over the trembling of half shock and half excitement that this might be the first time in my life I’m defeated.</p>



<p>「All right! I’ll kill you! 」</p>



<p>No, I haven’t lost yet. If I can’t do it with magic, let’s try to defeat it with something physical.</p>



<p>「Uaaghh! 」</p>



<p>I tear the handcuffs with all my strength. The chains were easily broken. OK, with this, the fight between me and the handcuffs have ended in a draw.</p>







<p>「Eh? 」</p>



<p>I found myself surrounded by armed men when I noticed. Alastor gave orders to the armed men with vile expression. &nbsp;</p>



<p>「Hey, what are you doing! Kill her off. 」</p>



<p>「Ano, excuse me. 」</p>



<p>「Ah, yes. The experiment is just a lie that I made up. I never thought I could catch you so easily. 」</p>



<p>「I’m sorry I broke this. 」</p>



<p>「What? 」</p>



<p>The rest of the armed men went rigid as they saw me tore away the handcuffs, and Alastor seemed too late to realize the fact.</p>



<p>His face that looks elated gradually grew pale.</p>







<p>「See, I’m not joking. Thank you for asking me to participate in this experiment. Well, let’s get this over. 」</p>



<p>「No&#8230; That’s impossible. 」</p>







<p>It appears that I was about to be killed. It’s a shame that he thought he could make me feel powerless by restricting my magic.</p>



<p>Alastor and the men were captured and handed them over to this kingdom’s soldier. The principal says I need to be careful since there must be some people in the school that guided them.</p>







<p>Two days later, I woke up feeling a sense of discomfort in my chest. And before me was a man with a face covered with a mask. Is he a pervert or something? Did he touch my chest?</p>



<p>「Ha, you fool&#8230; 」</p>



<p>When I opened my eyes, I was surprised to see the man holding a knife in his hand. My clothes have a hole in the chest. Did he stab me? But I didn’t feel any pain?</p>



<p>「Etto, you’re an assassin, right? 」</p>



<p>「Hii, monster! 」</p>



<p>I was about to be killed again. I don’t know this assassin’s level, but I think it would be easy to kill him.</p>







<p>「They have been trying to get me assassinated twice. You should probably stay away from me. 」</p>



<p>I spoke to him in the school corridor, telling him we’d better stay away for a while.</p>



<p>「But I don’t mind being bothered by Yumiela. It happened twice, what’s one more time. 」</p>



<p>Hey Patrick, don’t say such a disturbing thing. I almost get assassinated three times in a short time.</p>



<p>「Hey, look out! 」</p>



<p>An arrow flew from outside of the window. Even though it won’t hit and hurt him I still don’t want his clothes getting torn, so I grab the arrow with my hand.</p>



<p>「I’ll catch the archer! Patrick, find somewhere to hide! 」</p>



<p>I jump out of the window, trying to catch the culprit. I will not forgive them, what if it hits Patrick?</p>







<p>Perhaps the academy has become a den for assassins. I’m going to get out of the academy since tomorrow is a holiday.</p>







<p>「Surround her, quick! Don’t let her get away, stab her! 」</p>



<p>Twenty ruffians surrounded me in the Royal Capital’s hidden alleys. They were armed with spears and swords.</p>



<p>「Haa, Dark Bind. 」</p>



<p>「Uaaaahh, what is this?! 」</p>



<p>They are restrained by the arms that extend from the shadow. I have no patience for this crap.</p>



<p>So far, the assassins’ interrogation was entrusted to the soldiers, but to this day, they haven’t been able to identify the real mastermind. It’s about time I started looking for the culprit.</p>







<p>「Who is your leader? 」</p>



<p>No one gave me a name, but I can see their eyes focused on one man. He is the man who gave orders to surround me.</p>



<p>「You are the leader? Who gave you the order to put a hit on me? 」</p>



<p>「I don’t know. 」</p>



<p>「Shadow Lance. 」</p>



<p>A spear flies out of the shadow and goes through the man’s abdomen. The blood scattered all over the place.</p>



<p>「Kyaaaaaaaa! 」</p>



<p>Then I heal his injury with recovery magic. There will be no scar left on him.</p>



<p>「Heal. How many times I have to do this until you talk, hmm? 」</p>



<p>I don’t have any skill that could torture someone effectively without killing them, so I did this on repeat. It’s a humane torture because he will never die and didn’t suffer any wound.</p>







<p>「This is horrible. 」</p>



<p>「This isn’t something human do. 」</p>



<p>「She’s really a demon. 」</p>



<p>I thought what I was doing was something humane, but their reactions didn’t seem right.</p>



<p>「It doesn’t have to be your leader that talk to me, isn’t it? 」</p>



<p>As soon as I looked around, they shut their mouth and turned their gaze away from me.</p>







<p>「Please believe me, I really don’t know! I don’t see their face, but he told me to kill a black-haired girl from the Royal Academy. 」</p>



<p>The leader makes a desperate plea.</p>



<p>「That’s not enough. Don’t worry, even if I have to repeat this a hundred times, I still have enough magic. 」</p>



<p>「No! I swear I&#8217;m not lying about this! Please believe me!! 」</p>



<p>In the end, he burst out crying. Apparently, he really doesn’t know.</p>







<p>The stranger probably asks the other assassins in the same way. I can understand why there’s little progress to the investigation.</p>







<p>I was attacked in my room, a place where I rest. One night they just sneaked into my room, but now I’ll be safe because I’ve put a barrier in my room.</p>



<p>There was a plan to flying in the sky riding on Ryuu’s back, but it would burden him since he couldn’t sleep when he flies.</p>







<p>Now that I’m in my room, I let out a sigh while drinking the tea that Rita had prepared for me.</p>



<p>The tea still tastes strange for me. Should I consult a doctor if this continues? But everything else tastes normal.</p>







<p>Even so, their latest assassination attempts were getting more and more sloppy. Speaking of assassination, they usually use poison&#8230;</p>



<p>「Hey, Rita. Can you taste this tea? 」</p>



<p>When I offered the cup of tea I was drinking to Rita, she began to tremble, and her face paled.</p>



<p>「P-please forgive me. My sister is being held hostage&#8230; 」</p>



<p>Is that so? This past week I’ve been drinking poisoned tea. Maybe the poison is weak and had little effect.</p>



<p>「What kind of poison did you put into this? 」</p>



<p>「Um, I was given a poison that’s lethal in a drop dose. I put five drops every time&#8230; 」</p>



<p>And I barely noticed this.</p>







<p>The in-game poison was differentiated for their strength and had fixed damage; in reality, it depends on the poison. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I might have been dead now if the damage was fixed. No, will I have noticed when I was on the brink of death? It would be a disaster if that ever happens because my HP was bottomless.</p>







<p>「Because of that, I was ordered to&#8230; 」</p>



<p>The one who told Rita to poison me probably was her employer.</p>



<p>「Master ordered me to. 」</p>



<p>She confessed that to me, Rita seems given up knowing she couldn’t escape.</p>







<p>My father was the one who is trying to kill me.</p>
