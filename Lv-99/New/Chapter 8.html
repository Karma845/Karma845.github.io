<h2>Chapter 8: Reflections After a Night</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it! Why did I say something like that yesterday&#8230;?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was drowning in self-loathing the morning after.</p>

<p>And for good reason. Yesterday, I got drunk on Senpai&rsquo;s alcohol because I missed Senpai.</p>

<p>It was only natural to writhe in the harsh reality that awaited me upon sobering up, even if what I said was bound to come out eventually, with or without the influence of alcohol.</p>

<p>And Senpai still hadn&rsquo;t returned by morning.</p>

<p>The only message I received was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back around noon, so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t replied yet. I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>

<p> Should I just respond with &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;? Or should I express my true feelings with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried&rdquo;?</p>

<p>No good, my head was filled with thoughts of Senpai.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and there were no classes, but my heart couldn&rsquo;t find rest.</p>

<p>This was far worse than being constantly teased by Senpai.</p>

<p>This painful, suffocating feeling&#8230; I didn&rsquo;t want to experience it ever again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I should make breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following last night&rsquo;s dinner, I decided to make breakfast for the first time in a while.</p>

<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d find solace in cooking.</p>

<p>But with this unusual morning, I wanted to try something different&mdash;perhaps a fancy breakfast.</p>

<p>It was just before seven, around the time Senpai usually woke me up.</p>

<p>The fridge was stocked with bacon, eggs, butter, and chilled bread&mdash;perfect for breakfast.</p>

<p>Seeing the ingredients Senpai had bought made my heart tighten again.</p>

<p> I wanted to see Senpai so badly. I wanted to hear the response to yesterday&rsquo;s confession. I wanted a deeper relationship with Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>To suppress these continuous thoughts, I slammed the fridge door shut.</p>

<p>It was pointless if I didn&rsquo;t know Senpai&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

<p>Did I want to restrain Senpai?</p>

<p>Did I only like Senpai when she did as I wished?</p>

<p>No, that wasn&rsquo;t it. I loved Senpai for being true to herself. Whether it was the usual Senpai, the slightly bewildered Senpai when caught off guard, or the clumsy Senpai from yesterday, my affection grew because she always reacted in a way that was unique.</p>

<p>What was I trying to do by taking away Senpai&rsquo;s freedom?</p>

<p>As I mixed the eggs, sugar, and milk in a bowl, my thoughts began to settle.</p>

<p>With each ingredient blending together, my mind calmed down, and I realized how selfish I had been.</p>

<p>Yes, I wanted to live with Senpai more, but I had to consider Senpai&rsquo;s pace, or it would all be for nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make some for Senpai, just in case&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The breakfast base was ready in no time.</p>

<p>All that was left was to soak the bread in the egg mixture for a while and then fry it.</p>

<p>Ideally, it should be soaked for a few hours to a day, but this was just a casual breakfast.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s breakfast would have to be made with the bread barely soaked.</p>

<p>Resigned to this, I took the bread out of the egg mixture in the container and dropped it onto the hot frying pan, where the butter had just started to melt.</p>

<p> The sizzling sound of the bread frying was different from what you&rsquo;d see in a store.</p>

<p>Flipping it over, the uneven browning was a clear sign of me being bad at cooking, but the smell of the egg-soaked bread and the rich aroma of butter were still irresistible.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the uneven browning. I waited eagerly for the other side to finish cooking, wanting nothing more than to eat it right away.</p>

<p>And so, today&rsquo;s breakfast&mdash;French toast&mdash;was complete.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Itadakimasu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the long-awaited breakfast in front of me, I put my hands together and reached for the French toast with my fork, trying not to focus on the empty seat opposite me&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry for causing you so much trouble yesterday. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morning after, I left Yuu-chan&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>On my back was the alcohol I couldn&rsquo;t finish, and in my tote bag were the remnants of last night&rsquo;s cooking disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could have just left it here. Mistaking sugar and salt happens to anyone sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, this is my way of taking responsibility. I have to settle my own mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if Senpai insists, I won&rsquo;t stop you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu-chan had been telling me since this morning that it wasn&rsquo;t necessary to take it back, but I couldn&rsquo;t forgive myself.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t let Yuu-chan deal with the results of my training with my mother and my own weakness. I had to bear my own failures.</p>

<p>Perhaps understanding my feelings, Yuu-chan didn&rsquo;t say anything more about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Yuu-chan. What kind of face should I show Takashi-kun when I meet him? How should I return to his room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these thoughts, I prepared to face whatever came next.</p>

<p>The time was nine in the morning.</p>

<p>Normally, I would have already finished breakfast, and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been strange to be cuddling with Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>Pretending to hold hands, I could be pressing his arm into my chest, enjoying the expressions of my beloved.</p>

<p>It was a time when I should have been sharing wonderful moments with my lover.</p>

<p>None of this would have happened if I hadn&rsquo;t hesitated to surprise Takashi-kun by returning to his house early.</p>

<p>To put it more precisely, if I hadn&rsquo;t been shaken by Takashi-kun&rsquo;s words&mdash;by the mention of &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;</p>

<p> As I was thinking about this, I realized I had asked Yuu-chan a strange question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu-chan raised her voice in surprise at my question.</p>

<p>I like how Yuu-chan always reacts honestly in times like these, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about her being overly considerate.</p>

<p>Her response was straightforward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of face should you make when you see him? Just be your usual self? Tease Takashi like you always do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but&#8230; I just feel so pathetic&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still hung up on what Takashi said yesterday? About getting married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I haven&rsquo;t seen Takashi-kun that serious in a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My agitation settled down as I continued the straight-to-the-point conversation with Yuu-chan.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still hung up on what Takashi said yesterday? About getting married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I haven&rsquo;t seen Takashi-kun that serious in a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My agitation settled down as I continued the straight-to-the-point conversation with Yuu-chan.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe that I was the same person who had been fretting over last night&rsquo;s blunder upon waking up.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Takashi-kun would get tired of me just because of one or two mistakes.</p>

<p>If the man I truly loved was that fickle, I wouldn&rsquo;t have even thought about seriously learning to cook from my mother.</p>

<p>At most, I would have stuck to simple dishes.</p>

<p> I would never bother to learn something as complex as simmered dishes just for myself. It was because of Takashi-kun that I could become serious.</p>

<p>Yes, I was supposed to be serious&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought I was ready for this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t expected him to come at me with such seriousness.</p>

<p>Maybe the words from yesterday were just blurted out in the heat of the moment, but he was completely earnest the second time he spoke.</p>

<p>His face was red, and if I hadn&rsquo;t been so flustered, I would have definitely teased him, saying he looked &ldquo;so cute like an apple, I could just eat you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was so adorable and yet&mdash;so cool that I fell for him all over again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I was surprised at myself for not being ready to accept Takashi-kun&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>Despite my daily advances, this was how I reacted when it was my turn.</p>

<p>But it seems that my reaction was considered normal by society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready? We&rsquo;re still university students, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re adults. It wouldn&rsquo;t be strange for us to get married at any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Are you really serious&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu-chan looked a little, no, quite puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I seriously think it&rsquo;s okay for me to marry Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder I lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lose what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s just something on my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite understand what Yuu-chan meant by losing, but it seemed my resolve was a bit different from the norm.</p>

<p>But I think that&rsquo;s okay. Just as love doesn&rsquo;t need a reason, there&rsquo;s no need for a reason to want to monopolize someone you love, right?</p>

<p>As I thought about this, my feelings naturally calmed down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For now, I&rsquo;ll go back to Takashi-kun&rsquo;s place a bit earlier than the lunchtime I told him, tease him a little, and then think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s the usual after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just won&rsquo;t feel at ease if I don&rsquo;t stick to the usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, the most fun and thrilling part of communicating with Takashi-kun is when we&rsquo;re teasing each other.</p>

<p>With that excitement, I&rsquo;ll continue from where we left off yesterday.</p>

<p>Surely, Takashi-kun will forgive me.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t wait to see Takashi-kun. Even though our conversation at the entrance was ongoing, my feet were already pointing me back to him.</p>

<p>Seeing me like this, Yuu-chan asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, can I ask one last thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? You&rsquo;re being so formal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mentioned that you saw Takashi&rsquo;s serious face for the first time in a long time, but where did you see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell what Yuu-chan&rsquo;s intention was with her question, but I had my answer ready and responded immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it was when I first received a love confession from Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that, Yuu-chan told me, &ldquo;I see. You can go now,&rdquo; and I left her room.</p>

<p>Heading towards my beloved Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to make Takashi-kun my bride!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I returned to my lover&rsquo;s room, I blurted out such a thing without much thought, just reflexively.</p>

<p>Instinctively, I wanted to be with Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re shown such a display of feminine prowess&#8230; whether it&rsquo;s a boyfriend or not, you&rsquo;d want to make them your bride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Senpai? I know my marriage remark yesterday was sudden, and I do apologize for that, but are you so confused that you don&rsquo;t even know your own gender anymore? You&rsquo;re the bride, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But with things like this, how can you tell who&rsquo;s the girl!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Takashi-kun was bewildered, I was in shock, staring at the ingredients for French toast that he must have prepared for me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in my hand was the failed pot dish from yesterday at Yuu-chan&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a simple throw-in-the-pot dish where you just cut ingredients, put them in a pot, and simmer with soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Yet, even such a simple dish was a failure in front of the stylish homemade French toast.</p>

<p>Any girl would crave such an ideal breakfast menu that Takashi-kun had prepared. It&rsquo;s clear who the girl is. Yes, Takashi-kun, a boy, is the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Senpai? I understand that you&rsquo;re shaken by what I said yesterday, but you&rsquo;re overreacting. I&rsquo;m a guy, and you&rsquo;re the girl, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boy can become a bride too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they can&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t. The bride is supposed to be you, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Both of us as brides&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one bride, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite my agitation, Takashi-kun calmly unraveled my confusion.</p>

<p>With a part of my heart admitting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no match for him&#8230;&rdquo; I gradually began to calm down.</p>

<p>But as I calmed down, a wave of embarrassment washed over me.</p>

<p>Moreover, Takashi-kun was too calm, making me feel as if I were the one being teased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please forget what happened just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way, that&rsquo;s impossible. Besides, you were cute when you were flustered just now, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always flustered, so that makes it sound like I&rsquo;m always cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;? That&rsquo;s what I meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Takashi-kun&rsquo;s eyes were simply staring straight at me, with no malice to be felt.</p>

<p>They were nothing like mine. Just pure eyes that I love so dearly.</p>

<p>Eyes that seemed to draw me in endlessly, the eyes I fell in love with.</p>

<p>I remembered the time at the drinking circle when I was pestered and he came to my rescue. The eyes he had when he confessed to me in the heat of the moment. The eyes of the clumsy him that I fell in love with.</p>

<p>Back then, Takashi-kun said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to say it at such an embarrassing moment&#8230;&rdquo; and tried to take back his confession.</p>

<p>His sincerity only made me fall deeper in love.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was asking my mother for advice on how to win over the boy I liked.</p>

<p>One result of that advice was the pot dish I had attempted at Yuu-chan&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I open the pot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, but it&rsquo;s a failure, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m in the mood for Senpai&rsquo;s cooking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, I&rsquo;ll start making a new one&mdash;oh no, I left the ingredients behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to eat what&rsquo;s in the pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not okay with it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you devoured the French toast I made in no time at all. I even prepared enough for tomorrow, and now it&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, it was delicious&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to eat Senpai&rsquo;s delicious cooking too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, it&rsquo;s not delicious because it failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll still enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why does Takashi-kun stubbornly want to eat it even though I say it&rsquo;s a failure?</p>

<p>Even though a newly made one would taste better, he wants to eat the failed one.</p>

<p>Moreover, he&rsquo;s insistent, almost as if saying, &ldquo;Since you ate my cooking, you have to let me eat Senpai&rsquo;s cooking too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Does he understand that I can&rsquo;t refuse him now, and that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s doing this?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t compensate you anything if it&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, I lift the lid of the pot to reveal its contents.</p>

<p>The completely cooled, less sweet and more salty than usual&mdash;buri daikon.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> &ldquo;Senpai, shall we have a drink together now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as he saw the contents of the pot&mdash;&rsquo;Senpai&rsquo;s handmade buri daikon&rsquo;&mdash;he suddenly said that.</p>

<p>No, perhaps it&rsquo;s more accurate to say he couldn&rsquo;t help but say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now? It&rsquo;s still before noon, you know? Even if we don&rsquo;t have school today, you&rsquo;re getting a little too excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. The drinks yesterday weren&rsquo;t fun at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not fun&#8230; Ahh, I knew it! Some of my alcohol is missing!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I miss you and just went for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were that lonely, you should have just told me to come back earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would ruin Senpai&rsquo;s fun if I did that. I don&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you went ahead with a proposal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s mood starts to return after I show my weak side. I could clearly see her spirits gradually lifting from her previously disheartened state.</p>

<p>Otherwise, she wouldn&rsquo;t be checking the canned Chuhai in the fridge while scolding me.</p>

<p>And now, Senpai&rsquo;s mouth starts to curl into a smirk&mdash;I&rsquo;m certain of it.</p>

<p>And Senpai in that state is&mdash;relentless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you start talking about marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&#8230; you&rsquo;re just so cute, Senpai&#8230; and I thought how nice it would be if this life could continue forever&#8230; and before I knew it, the words just came out&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, Senpai&rsquo;s mood is rising again. The corners of her mouth are turning up even more.</p>

<p>And the teasing begins again&mdash;</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, why do you want to drink now? Tell me, and maybe I&rsquo;ll join you~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that, but you&rsquo;re totally ready to drink together. And not just a little&mdash;you&rsquo;ve even brought four cans with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a direct invitation from Takashi-kun. I have to drink a lot, right~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Senpai who had been fretting over the failed cooking just moments ago was no longer there.</p>

<p>Instead, standing right before me, there was only the Senpai who adored alcohol.</p>

<p>My beloved Senpai, who never hides her love for the things she adores.</p>

<p>She teases me whenever there&rsquo;s a chance, a lover who seems almost too good for someone like me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s it about? The reason part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My lover sits right beside me on the sofa, her sweet scent wafting through the air. But it&rsquo;s not just that. There&rsquo;s a faint smell of soy sauce as well.</p>

<p>Yet still, my heart is completely taken by Senpai&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>Even through her shirt, there&rsquo;s an alluring softness that draws me in. So much so that all the thoughts I had been pondering vanish completely.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m utterly smitten with every little movement Senpai makes.</p>

<p>At that point, I had nothing left to lose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;When I saw Senpai&rsquo;s buri daikon, I just wanted to get all lovey-dovey with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I said, I just wanted to get all lovey-dovey with you, Senpai!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even after spilling my true feelings, I felt neither pain nor itch.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it felt as if a fog had lifted from my heart, leaving me feeling refreshed. But that moment was fleeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you mean&#8230; you thought if you said you wanted to get lovey-dovey in your drunken state, you could blame it on the alcohol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Hearing Senpai&rsquo;s words made me feel a bit embarrassed about my current situation.</p>

<p>Blaming it on alcohol, what kind of man does that?</p>

<p>Such thoughts crossed my mind.</p>

<p>However, reality was different. To Senpai, such things were trivial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahahaha! Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;ve started thinking naughty things, huh? You don&rsquo;t need to do that. Getting lovey-dovey with Takashi-kun is always welcome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai laughs off the idea of blaming it on alcohol.</p>

<p>Moreover, she even goes as far as to say she&rsquo;s been waiting to get lovey-dovey.</p>

<p>It seems Kureha Senpai has already made up her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, we&rsquo;re going to get married eventually, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I still have some embarassment about the words I said yesterday&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nnghh~! The alcohol tastes very nice when you drink in the afternoon!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even after all that, you&rsquo;re still eagerly drinking. What was all that earlier exchange about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Completely opposite from when she returned to the room earlier, Senpai is now more carefree than ever.</p>

<p>She takes a can of Chuhai from the fridge and drinks it heartily, savoring it with a pleased hum.</p>

<p>Watching Senpai like this, I feel even more pathetic for fretting over the words I had spoken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Takashi-kun, you never asked me to drink before, so I got a little worried~. I thought maybe something was up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite that, you brought four cans. And you&rsquo;re already on your second one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai places the empty can on the table in front of us and starts guzzling down the newly opened drink.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no sign of &ldquo;worry&rdquo; from the cheerful Senpai before me. At least, not from the current carefree Senpai.</p>

<p> And it seems that&rsquo;s how Senpai sees me too.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;re drinking heartily yourself. It looks like you&rsquo;ve really gotten used to the taste of alcohol~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yeah&#8230; It&rsquo;s fun to drink with you, Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say such nice things. Do you want to drink more? Or get lovey-dovey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I not already getting lovey-dovey, with my hand being held, my arm being pressed against your chest, and you occasionally breathing into my ear!? And yes, I&rsquo;ll have another drink, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite my strong words about getting lovey-dovey, I don&rsquo;t try to escape the situation.</p>

<p>Instead, I grip her hand back firmly, snuggle up to my lover on my own, and even lean in to her hair, seemingly enjoying the current situation.</p>

<p>As if seeing right through me, Senpai momentarily pulls away.</p>

<p> But it&rsquo;s not because she&rsquo;s fed up with my behavior. She simply went to get a new drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, a strong one for you~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai hands me a can of Chuhai with a significantly higher alcohol content than what I usually drink. And in her other hand, she holds another one just like it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t drink normally. Even if it were handed to me, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t drink it if I were in my usual mood.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m not in my usual mood today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying you want to get more lovey-dovey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it! I&rsquo;m saying, isn&rsquo;t this already lovey-dovey enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, don&rsquo;t you want to be more lovey-dovey with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just think that maybe this sort of thing should be reserved for when we&rsquo;re just a couple&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Even after you proposed to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teased, seduced, and gazed at with longing&#8230; Senpai&rsquo;s every gesture and her ever-changing expressions all shake my feelings, making it impossible to stay in a normal mood.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s to the point where I can&rsquo;t handle it without drinking.</p>

<p>Yet, there&rsquo;s still a part of me that tries to hold back, not wanting to rely on alcohol.</p>

<p>I think to myself, what am I saying after I proposed under the influence of alcohol yesterday?</p>

<p>And as always, Senpai sees right through me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should pour you a little more drink. I&rsquo;ll bring some buri daikon. It&rsquo;s a bit salty, but that should help the alcohol go down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;m not planning on getting any more lovey-dovey than this, okay&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t do anything like attack you. I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to you that I wouldn&rsquo;t like to do to myself. I would never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai stands up for the second time and retrieves the buri daikon from the refrigerator, bringing it over steaming hot, as if it were just made, looking glossy and perfect as a snack to accompany the alcohol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about we talk about the future today? We have plenty of time, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, she places the buri daikon on the table.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s saltier than I expected when I try it, but not so much that I reject it.</p>

<p>Rather, it&rsquo;s just the right amount of saltiness to accelerate the intoxication.</p>

<p>The conversation about our future, which I can&rsquo;t have without a drink, is about to begin&#8230; or so I thought until the doorbell rings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello? Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to take my daughter back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Y-yes!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Bring Ootani Kureha to me. I am her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, uhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing? Hurry up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing at the door is a man in a suit with a stern expression.</p>

<p>Despite the wrinkles on his face, his solid build is clearly visible even through the suit.</p>

<p>Faced with such a man, I can only meekly comply.</p>

<p>I knew I had to confront the strict father of my lover eventually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was it? Did you order some naughty magazines or something? You can&rsquo;t do that, you know, you should pick them up at the convenience store.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unaware that her father is approaching, Kureha Senpai says this as she walks to the entrance.</p>

<p>Her atmosphere is always the same, no matter the situation.</p>

<p>Her expression remains serene and unchanged.</p>

<p>To such a senpai, my pathetic self from moments ago vanishes.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remain bogged down by those pitiful feelings forever, especially since conversations with Senpai are far from boring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t ordered any recently, okay!? Besides, that&rsquo;s the least of my worries right now!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm?? Teasing Takashi-kun aside, what could possibly be so important that you&rsquo;re in such a panic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, your father is here!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conversations with Senpai are always fun.</p>

<p>Since I never know what topic will come flying out of Senpai&rsquo;s mouth next, I find myself both nervous and excited.</p>

<p>But this time, it seems difficult to feel excited.</p>

<p>Because the man who arrived was far more imposing than the one I had heard about from Senpai.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh&#8230; why&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious, isn&rsquo;t it? Because you haven&rsquo;t been contacting us properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment Senpai sees her father peering in from the entrance, her expression turns stern.</p>

<p>The usually cheerful Senpai now has a furrowed brow, clearly showing her displeasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always tell you, no matter how busy you are, to at least keep in touch with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have been keeping in touch with mom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just mom, I&rsquo;ve told you to contact me as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should be enough that I&rsquo;m contacting mom! Why do I have to report everything to dad as well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you used to contact me properly at the beginning of university. Why has it suddenly become just mom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re always so nitpicky and persistent dad!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Persistent&#8213;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#8230;Yeah, it&rsquo;s time to stop this.</p>

<p>The argument is escalating, and Senpai&rsquo;s irritation is becoming more apparent.</p>

<p>Seeing Senpai talking in this tone is rare, and while I feel a sense of nostalgia, I can&rsquo;t bear to watch her father showered with shocking words any longer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;L-let&rsquo;s calm down for a moment. I&rsquo;ll prepare some tea now. Okay, Senpai? Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no right to call me father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s right. To him, I&rsquo;m neither a son nor anything else.</p>

<p>I understand that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be called &lsquo;father&rsquo; by me, but I wish he&rsquo;d at least pretend a little.</p>

<p>Also, I wish he&rsquo;d stop looking at me like I&rsquo;m his mortal enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, what should I&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still glaring at me, I face him head-on and ask.</p>

<p> I respond sincerely while ooking him in the eyes, hoping to show that I am a lover worthy of Kureha Senpai, even if just a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Koutarou&#8230; it&rsquo;s Ootani Koutarou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps my feelings have reached him, even if just a bit.</p>

<p>Koutarou-san lets out a small sigh, and the sharpness in his eyes softens. As expected of Senpai&rsquo;s father, he could change his expression quickly.</p>

<p>With just a little nudge, he becomes calm in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Koutarou-san, let&rsquo;s sit down in the living room and talk calmly. I&rsquo;ll prepare some tea, so please go ahead and make yourself comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have much to offer, so please forgive us for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you for inviting me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the beginning, Koutarou-san presented himself with the composed demeanor of an adult.</p>

<p>Instinctively, I straightened my back in response.</p>

<p>However, as I proceeded with the preparations, Senpai, who was at the center of it all, seemed to be plotting something during a moment of her father&rsquo;s inattention.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hehe, this is the perfect chance while Dad&rsquo;s off guard&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up to, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Just a little cleaning request, maybe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Senpai&rsquo;s hand was a smartphone, a glimpse of a messaging app visible, and the mention of a cleaning request.</p>

<p>Honestly, I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand, but I had seen that expression on Senpai&rsquo;s face many times before.</p>

<p>It was the same one she wore when she teased me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Takashi-kun. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing for you to be concerned about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai reassured me with her words, but I couldn&rsquo;t shake off my unease.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t trust Senpai. I just didn&rsquo;t trust myself. I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could endure the anxiety that maybe it wasn&rsquo;t just me she was teasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once we&rsquo;ve dealt with your father&rsquo;s situation, we can cuddle as much as you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai, seemingly oblivious to my worries, floated with light steps toward the living room where Koutarou-san awaited.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, even as I sit here, my mind is unchanged. I will take Kureha back with me. That&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koutarou-san crossed his arms as soon as he sat at the table, signaling his unwavering intent.</p>

<p>However, Kureha Senpai had her own determination&mdash;to continue living with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you&rsquo;ll take me back, but I have no intention of going back home! I want to live with Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Live together? Who gave you permission for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mom did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother is always doing things on her own&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Koutarou-san&rsquo;s tone, it was clear that this was not the first time there had been a misunderstanding within the family.</p>

<p> Moreover, I was strongly convinced that Senpai&rsquo;s free-spirited nature was inherited from her mother.</p>

<p>I had sensed it during the birthday phone call, but now I truly realized just how excessively carefree the mother and daughter were.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t afford to dwell on my realizations and feelings, as the person before me was not the gentle Kureha Senpai, but her father, whom I had heard was quite strict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay silent. Why don&rsquo;t you say something? From what I saw at the entrance, it seems Kureha has been causing you trouble, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I am often caught up in Senpai&rsquo;s whims, that&rsquo;s true&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so-I thought so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not like I find it bothersome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koutarou-san&rsquo;s behavior was hesitant, perhaps because he didn&rsquo;t receive the response he was expecting.</p>

<p>Indeed, I am constantly being tossed about by her moods.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say it&rsquo;s all the time, constantly, around the clock.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s moody. One moment she seems mature, the next she&rsquo;s jealous like a child.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m always at the mercy of such a richly emotional Senpai, both mentally and physically.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s not to say I want her to stop, let alone that I&rsquo;ve ever found it bothersome.</p>

<p>After all, I can&rsquo;t help but love such a Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Ehehe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;What&rsquo;s so funny? This is a serious moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? But it&rsquo;s okay if we do it secretly, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Secretly? What are you planning to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I just want to touch Takashi-kun a little bit, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s hand reaches out to mine, secretly yet firmly.</p>

<p>No matter how close our seats are, we won&rsquo;t get off easily if Koutarou-san notices.</p>

<p>I should let go, I know I shouldn&rsquo;t continue like this&#8230; Yet, I can&rsquo;t shake her off.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s mischievous voice tickles my ear, dulling my senses a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, Takashi-kun&rsquo;s hand is quite soft and squishy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk, Senpai. Your hand is soft and squishy too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right~? A girl&rsquo;s body is soft and squishy. You know that well, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, well&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be honest, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;~&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t deny it. I couldn&rsquo;t deny it because I knew all too well the softness of Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufu, Takashi-kun is really cute, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Really, this Senpai is so free-spirited.</p>

<p>This freedom is characteristic of Senpai, and I can&rsquo;t really say anything since I was drawn to such a Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What are you two laughing with over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, it&rsquo;s nothing!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you panic like that, even I will feel hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Koutarou-san.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm. As long as you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Called out by Koutarou-san, I was brought back to reality.</p>

<p>My melting reason solidified, and I returned to my normal state of mind.</p>

<p>Koutarou-san frowned slightly with a touch of loneliness.</p>

<p>I sense a similar loneliness in him and can&rsquo;t help but see my beloved Kureha Senpai in him.</p>

<p>They really are like parent and child.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stretch my legs a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s a serious person. I felt that keenly in just a few minutes. The intimidation I initially felt was no longer there.</p>

<p>&mdash;But I soon realized that it was merely being overlooked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-you guys! What do you think you&rsquo;re doing during this serious discussion?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must have been when he stretched his legs and stood up that he caught a glimpse under the table.</p>

<p>His expression suddenly turned to one of anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean what? We&rsquo;re just flirting, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just flirting! How many times do I have to tell you! Be more careful with your relationships!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the serious situation, Senpai remained completely unfazed.</p>

<p>Without showing any sign of disturbance, she confronted her father.</p>

<p>In contrast, Koutarou-san, who had just confirmed that our hands were clasped together under the desk, suddenly began to lose his composure and started to get angry, a stark change from his previously calm demeanor.</p>

<p>Amidst this, Senpai was unusually calm.</p>

<p>She managed to maintain her characteristic Senpai-like presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m seriously and carefully considering my relationship with Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you have to be so close to each other!? What if something happens!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;something&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t explain it, then don&rsquo;t complain about my relationship with Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, wait&#8230; Senpai!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> An emotional clash between parent and child.</p>

<p>Koutarou-san raised his voice to separate us as we publicly displayed our affection.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kureha Senpai kept getting closer and closer to me.</p>

<p>Watching this, Koutarou-san&rsquo;s emotions escalated, and in response, Kureha Senpai pressed even closer.</p>

<p>My heart raced as I felt her pressing against me, and then suddenly, she pulled my arm tightly towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s come to this, why don&rsquo;t we show just how much Takashi-kun and I love each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show? Koutarou-san will get even angrier at us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found myself pulled towards Senpai&rsquo;s stomach, ending up in an embrace around her waist.</p>

<p>A sweet scent tickled my nostrils, a dangerously intoxicating aroma that almost melted my reason away.</p>

<p>I tried to straighten up in a panic, but a gentle stroke from above made me lose my strength.</p>

<p>Gazing down at me with a mischievous sweet smile, my lover made me feel like giving in, thinking this might just be alright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon, I think Dad won&rsquo;t just be angry anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What could she mean by &lsquo;not just angry&rsquo;?</p>

<p>If anything, this situation seemed like it would only make him angrier.</p>

<p>As I was gripped by this anxiety, it happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so bold! Let go! You two are still kids! It&rsquo;ll be too late if something happens!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Ring.</p>

<p>An inopportune ringtone sounded from inside the suit, completely ignoring Koutarou-san&rsquo;s earnest persuasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, at a time like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Koutarou-san checked the caller, his face turned pale.</p>

<p>In contrast, Kureha Senpai smirked, seemingly having anticipated this.</p>

<p>It was clear that Senpai had set something up, but who could make a grown man turn pale?</p>

<p>As I pondered this, Koutarou-san put the smartphone to his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, hello. What&rsquo;s wrong, Haruka? It&rsquo;s rare for you to call me. No, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want you to call! I would never think like that, Haruka!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stammering and exaggerated, Koutarou-san&rsquo;s reaction left me unable to hide my surprise.</p>

<p>And so was the person next me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This person called Haruka is amazing, isn&rsquo;t she&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, she is. My mom is pretty incredible, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>My surprise doubled.</p>

<p>I mean, I kind of expected it. I knew that Senpai&rsquo;s mother&#8213;Haruka-san, must hold significant decision-making power in the family.</p>

<p>But who would have thought it was to this extent?</p>

<p> That the strict father of my lover would be so weak against his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go back now? That&rsquo;s a little&#8230; I&rsquo;m in the middle of an important conversation with Kureha, okay? Please stop saying things like I&rsquo;ll have to skip meals! What am I supposed to do if I can&rsquo;t eat your cooking, Haruka!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The atmosphere seemed to be turning ominous. Or rather, it was somewhat pitiful to see Koutarou-san getting teary-eyed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to be a loving husband, but at this point, it makes me wonder if it&rsquo;s a different situation altogether.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Alright&#8230; okay, I get it&#8230; I&rsquo;ll be home soon. So please, cheer up. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do if Haruka started to dislike me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like witnessing something I shouldn&rsquo;t see.</p>

<p>Like secretly sneaking a peek into matters that were meant to be hidden, that&rsquo;s how it feels.</p>

<p>And yet, I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off Koutarou-san, nor could I leave the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about Dad, just pay attention to me, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pay attention to me?</p>

<p>As if to make it clearer, she kept pushing her palm against me.</p>

<p>No, it was more than just her palm, her belly was pressing against my face.</p>

<p>The soft and fluffy sensation was a different dimension of touch from what I usually felt against my arms or chest, and I knew it would be bad to get sucked in.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt this sense of danger. With Senpai, I might have been swept along until just before crossing the final line.</p>

<p>But now it&rsquo;s different. This isn&rsquo;t a space just for Senpai and me.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s father, Koutarou-san, is in the room.</p>

<p>If we started our usual flirting now, the now-calm Koutarou-san might explode again with anger.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the last thing I want to happen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, alright, I understand. I&rsquo;ll make time for Kureha on another occasion. So please, wait for me with dinner ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I endured the temptation of Senpai&rsquo;s palm, Koutarou-san&rsquo;s phone call ended.</p>

<p>Phew&#8230; I wanted to offer him words of comfort, but before I could, Senpai spoke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to say to Dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha, you&rsquo;re acting like a child again&#8230; Don&rsquo;t you ever think about growing up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if Dad doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge it, I am now a proper adult.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Where exactly is the adult in you when you snap back like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Senpai&#8230; let&rsquo;s not go any further, okay? Please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm~? Are you worried about me~? That&rsquo;s sweet~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m worried&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I was soothing Senpai, Koutarou-san noticed a forgotten can of Chuhai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, drinking Chuhai in the middle of the day is why you&rsquo;re still a child. You&rsquo;re an adult now, so grow up already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Koutarou-san picked up the empty can, I couldn&rsquo;t pull myself away from Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s at times like these that I realize it.</p>

<p>No matter what, I always prioritize Senpai.</p>

<p>Not that I&rsquo;ve ever thought it was a bad thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be heading home for today. Haruka told me to let it be, so I won&rsquo;t insist on taking you back, but we&rsquo;ll have a proper talk later. Until then, be ready to come home at any time. Got it, Kureha?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Hmph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, make sure you don&rsquo;t do anything weird to Kureha, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Koutarou-san&rsquo;s stern gaze fell upon me as I reluctantly replied to Senpai, who was still clinging to my waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do anything weird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha is still a child, so make sure you maintain a proper relationship with her. Understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll take my leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said his piece, Koutarou-san turned on his heel and headed for the entrance.</p>

<p>Senpai and I could only watch him leave from the living room.</p>

<p> After Koutarou-san left, the mood for drinking had completely dissipated between Senpai and me.</p>

<p>We silently ate the buri daikon that Senpai had specially made, and then we each busied ourselves with our university tasks until it was suddenly time to go to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry about my dad showing up so suddenly, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mom will handle it, so don&rsquo;t worry about it, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a day that felt both long and short, and yet it was full of turmoil.</p>

<p>A proper relationship, huh&#8230;?</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a bit late to be telling me that now&#8230;</p>

<p>I reminisced about Senpai&rsquo;s action today, ruminating on my honest feelings along with the enchanting scent.</p>
