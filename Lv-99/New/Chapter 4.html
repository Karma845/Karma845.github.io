<h2>Chapter 4: The First Bar Visit</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Takashi-kun! Let&rsquo;s go to a bar today!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One evening, my Senpai, who had returned from university classes earlier than me, suddenly proposed something unusual.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, who rarely suggests eating out, was now saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to a bar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but be wary that something was up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, what do you mean by &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I braced myself for some teasing, ready for whatever she might throw at me.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t always be the other end of Senpai&rsquo;s jokes. I had to fight back a little.</p>

<p> That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.</p>

<p>However, it seemed my wariness was unnecessary as Kureha Senpai began to look at me with serious eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a little since then. About how I could have a good time with Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the day you came back from cheating on me with your best friend, having yakiniku and drinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words dripped out, reminding me of my recent blunder.</p>

<p>Despite having Kureha Senpai, I had gone out for yakiniku and drinks with a friend of the opposite sex&mdash;a grave mistake I should not have made.</p>

<p>And then, unavoidably, I remembered the punishment that followed.</p>

<p>A stimulating punishment that was eighty percent reward and twenty percent hardship, typical of Senpai.</p>

<p>Even now, just thinking about it brought back the heat of that moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I explained that I couldn&rsquo;t refuse, and you understood that, didn&rsquo;t you? I told you that Yuu is just a close friend and there&rsquo;s nothing romantic between us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I vehemently denied Senpai&rsquo;s words as if to drive away the sensations that were starting to return.</p>

<p> Of course I was entirely at fault, and I had received a fitting punishment, which I had no complaints about.</p>

<p>But it was tough to have it dredged up again.</p>

<p>I had demonstrated my innocence. I had also clearly stated and demonstrated that I was devoted only to Senpai.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I thought she had &ldquo;understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t expected her to bring it up again, and in my panic, I raised my voice.</p>

<p>But, once again, my worries were for naught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I understood that part. I knew how much you love me, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not true? You don&rsquo;t love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love the blushing you, too~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai smiled broadly while saying that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again, Senpai, doing something like that&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I just thought you seemed to be having too much fun by yourself&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything is fun when I&rsquo;m with Takashi-kun~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although I felt a twinge of frustration at being teased by Senpai again, seeing her cheeks flushed with joy and having fun made all my irritation seem trivial.</p>

<p>In fact, if my recent blunder had been elevated to a source of teasing for Senpai, then perhaps that was something to be happy about.</p>

<p>I had vowed not to do anything that would sadden Senpai again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, what does what you just said have to do with going to a bar? We could just drink in our room.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Having settled the past in my mind, I finally got back to the main topic.</p>

<p>Ever since Senpai started coming to my room, the collection of alcohol on the side of the kitchen has been steadily growing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the sweet liquor that Senpai prefers, the obligatory beer, and then the wine. I have more alcohol than the average &ldquo;I drink alcohol~&rdquo; kind of person.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s mainly Kureha Senpai who drinks. I can only drink a little, and just seeing Senpai enjoy her drinks is enough for me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a bit puzzled by the invitation to go to a bar this time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not because I can&rsquo;t drink much. I just don&rsquo;t want to show the slightly tipsy Senpai from alcohol to other people.</p>

<p>Senpai is already eye-catching enough on a regular day. Add to that a state of drunkenness, and she becomes an even more attractive target.</p>

<p>I want to avoid that. I don&rsquo;t want Senpai to be the focus of other men&rsquo;s gazes, and I wish only I could look at her that way.</p>

<p>Yet, despite all this, there&rsquo;s a part of me that can&rsquo;t resist the allure of a night date with Senpai, something we&rsquo;ve never done even now that we&rsquo;re already living together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want to go on a night date with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love how you answer so honestly and immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Behind Senpai&rsquo;s beaming smile, I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that she understands my intentions, and even knowing that, she would still choose to tease me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s Kureha Senpai for you, and I can&rsquo;t help but love her for it, with no complaints whatsoever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t date at night before because of my house curfew, but now that we&rsquo;re living together, we can fully enjoy our night dates~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They easily agreed to living together, but there was actually a strict curfew, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the curfew was set by my father. No matter how I am his &lsquo;cute daughter&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m over twenty years old. It&rsquo;s too much to be told to come home by 21:00.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard several times about the strictness of Senpai&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>Senpai, who never speaks ill of others, only ever has complaints for one person &ndash; her father.</p>

<p> One of the hardships that made Senpai grimace was the curfew. Having a 21:00 curfew as a university student is just too unreasonable.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of that, we hardly ever went on dates after classes before we started living together.</p>

<p>The exception was when she had part-time work; she was allowed to stay out past curfew, but she had to report when she left her job, as if under surveillance&#8230;</p>

<p>So, the most couple-like things we did before living together were holding hands before the circle activities started or chatting in the cafeteria.</p>

<p>Knowing that Senpai stayed over on my birthday made me realize the idea of living together was serious.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the fact that you got permission to live together means that Senpai&rsquo;s seriousness got through, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I-I guess. I&rsquo;m grateful my father was somehow flexible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find an opportunity to go greet him properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;ll find the right opportunity later!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai seems a bit off, but I&rsquo;m not sure if I should say anything about it.</p>

<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard, Senpai&rsquo;s father is strict, and I wonder if I can meet him without any rudeness.</p>

<p>As I harbor these anxieties, Senpai tugs at the sleeve of my shirt.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Anyway, let&rsquo;s dress up today! It&rsquo;s a bar, after all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-Yes! I&rsquo;m starting to get nervous!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both of us are filled with our own thoughts about the night at the bar.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun~, sorry to keep you waiting~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-No, it&rsquo;s fine! I wasn&rsquo;t waiting at all!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, I was the one who sent you to the station first, so you should say, &lsquo;I was waiting, but seeing Senpai&rsquo;s lovely appearance made it all worth it&rsquo;~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting at the station clock tower for thirty minutes.</p>

<p>She appears before me, wearing black inner shorts and a high-waisted gray skirt with a slit and a white cardigan draped over her shoulders.</p>

<p>She looks more fashionable than usual &ndash; that&rsquo;s Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>And above all, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel nervous in the presence of my unfamiliar lover with her long hair let down.</p>

<p>The see through fabric around her neckline only intensified that feeling.</p>

<p> Unlike her usual casual attire, Senpai looked a bit more grown-up, and I found myself acting awkwardly as I tried to say the usual clich&eacute;, but upon reflection, those words were meaningless.</p>

<p>After all, we live in the same room, and Senpai knew that I had left before her.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed that Senpai was pleased to hear those clich&eacute; words as she smiled warmly at me.</p>

<p>Even with a different hairstyle, the person inside was still my beloved Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no&#8230; Really. I was just thinking about what kind of outfit Senpai would wear, and before I knew it, it was time to go&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! You always look so good, Senpai, I have to be prepared&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, do you think my outfit lives up to your expectations? How do I look now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beyond expectations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehehe, yay! Victory for me today!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I conveyed how much I had been looking forward to Senpai&rsquo;s fashion and how it exceeded my expectations, Kureha Senpai showed a very happy smile again.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what about my own outfit?</p>

<p>Black jeans, a white shirt with a simple logo, and a plain navy jacket.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable, but I thought maybe it wasn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

<p>It was clear that compared to Senpai, my outfit seemed too simple, and I lost a bit of confidence.</p>

<p>It seemed like it would take more time for me to become a man worthy of Senpai.</p>

<p>Standing amidst the bustling station front while watching the attractive figure of Senpai, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think so.</p>

<p>To escape this situation that was on the verge of self-loathing, I asked Senpai a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, where are we going now? You mentioned going to a bar. Is it near the station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At least let&rsquo;s move on from here. I thought that starting our night date was the best option.</p>

<p> However, I had forgotten something important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s a bit hard to find, but it&rsquo;s a cozy, hidden spot that&rsquo;s quite fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, but money&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm? What&rsquo;s about the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used up quite a bit during that last yakiniku outing&#8230; and it&rsquo;s even worse since I&rsquo;m before my part-time job&rsquo;s payday&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had completely forgotten that I had spent a lot during the forced yakiniku with Yuu until just now.</p>

<p>I could have checked before the date or gone to the ATM, but I was too focused on what Senpai might wear, and here we are.</p>

<p>Even if I had realized it, given my current financial situation, after accounting for necessary withdrawals, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been much left anyway.</p>

<p>As I braced myself for Senpai&rsquo;s disappointment, an unexpected response came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. Takashi-kun, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about money tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment, I didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of her words.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry? About what? Was she not dissapointed? Or was it something else&#8230;?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about money? Could it be that she knew all along that I didn&rsquo;t have any cash on me&#8230;?</p>

<p>Various speculations raced through my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;But I really can&rsquo;t just let you treat me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without fully understanding Senpai&rsquo;s intentions, I got carried away with the idea of being treated on our first night date.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew well that Senpai wasn&rsquo;t a demon. Rather, she was a kind girlfriend who forgave me for making her sad, only temporarily forbidding indulgence in desires.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tsk tsk tsk, you&rsquo;re too sweet, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was treating you~? Of course, I&rsquo;ll pay for today, but it&rsquo;s not going to be for free. You should understand that much, right, Takashi-kun? You&rsquo;re working part-time, after all~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying I need to prepare something of equivalent value&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You catch on quick, Takashi-kun. I&rsquo;m impressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know that Kureha Senpai is a mischievous troublemaker and that I&rsquo;m her only target.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m happy and even proud of being the only one she teases.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said about Senpai&rsquo;s clothing choices too.</p>

<p>Inside the room, her chest is dangerously exposed, or her thighs are completely bare, but when we go out for a date, she dresses nicely while making sure to guard herself properly.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s intentional or not, only Senpai knows, but currently, I&rsquo;m the only one who knows her unguarded appearance.</p>

<p>What more should I ask?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m the only one who knows Senpai&rsquo;s other side.</p>

<p>As her boyfriend, I&rsquo;m the one who knows the most about Senpai. I won&rsquo;t share her with anyone. I&rsquo;m the only one who knows Senpai well, and I&rsquo;m fine with being the only one she teases.</p>

<p>As I think about this, the self-loathing I felt until now vanishes.</p>

<p>At the same time, I realize there&rsquo;s a slightly more confident version of myself.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t miss the chance while I&rsquo;m feeling collected.</p>

<p>So, I casually ask Senpai a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what should I do? Just make sure it was something possible for me, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll have you do something that only Takashi-kun can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai answers with a smile, and the next moment, she positions herself right beside me, intertwining her arm and interlocking her finger with mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stay like this until we get back to our place today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The confident me disappeared in an instant.</p>

<p> Senpai&rsquo;s arm in mine, the interlocking finger, and her sweet voice&mdash;a triple combo&mdash;reduced me back to my usual self, the one who&rsquo;s merely teased&#8230;</p>

<p>Still, if I can continue to feel Senpai like this even outside, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad, I think to myself.</p>

<p>What a lucky person I am.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230; really like a secret hideout, isn&rsquo;t it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After about five minutes of being guided by Kureha Senpai from the station, we arrived in front of a small building emitting a suspicious neon glow in a dark alley.</p>

<p>The building&rsquo;s entrance had several shop names: pubs, maid cafes, and other establishments you wouldn&rsquo;t normally see in the bright areas near the station.</p>

<p>Among them was the name of the bar we were looking for.</p>

<p>The bar&rsquo;s name was &ldquo;Hyde.&rdquo; The name was so fitting that I felt relieved.</p>

<p>Seeing my reaction, the pleased Kureha Senpai began to lead me into the building without letting go of the arm she had been holding since the station.</p>

<p> &ldquo;This place is great, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s a hidden gem, so I sometimes come here on my days off~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you can&rsquo;t come after classes because of curfew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right~. So, actually, this is my first time coming to this place with someone else~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inside the elevator heading to the third-floor bar, Senpai unexpectedly rests her face on my shoulder.</p>

<p> The word &ldquo;first time&rdquo; from her adds to the impact, and all I can do is tremble in body and heart.</p>

<p>Of course, such a reaction is perfect teasing material for Kureha Senpai&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, did that make your heart race?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;t&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re holding hands, it&rsquo;s easy to tell when you&rsquo;re flustered, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She intertwines her fingers with mine more tightly, making me even more aware of Senpai&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p> If that were to happen, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to look at Senpai&rsquo;s face anymore.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d just end up staring at Senpai&rsquo;s lips, unable to concentrate on the conversation, my attention alternating between her lips and hands.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before my desires start to accumulate.</p>

<p>Realizing this, I naturally turned my head in the opposite direction of Senpai.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no way Senpai would miss the fact that I was looking away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re turning your face away~. There&rsquo;s no need to be shy because I&rsquo;m feeling thrilled and nervous about this too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai said, placing her free hand on my chin and gently turning my face back towards them.</p>

<p>Once again, I was confronted with Senpai&rsquo;s expression, that usual teasing look. It was a devilish smile that seemed to see right through me, shaking my heart and amplifying my affection.</p>

<p>Despite not having drunk any alcohol yet, Senpai&rsquo;s lips were slightly moist, which only added to her allure.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not that I dislike Senpai&rsquo;s devilish charm; it&rsquo;s just that I hate being one-sidedly attacked. If I could find an opening to counterattack, I&rsquo;d be able to look at Senpai&rsquo;s face with confidence.</p>

<p>This time too, that&rsquo;s the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true? You&rsquo;re feeling nervous too, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Want to check?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would I do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m plotting a counterattack, trying to find Senpai&rsquo;s weakness.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, obviously, you&rsquo;d press your palm against my chest to feel it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehehe, just kidding~. Did I make your heart race again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you did&#8230; you&rsquo;re too much for my heart&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had just honestly said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m nervous,&rsquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t have had to turn your face away and try to escape, right~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As long as you understand. Remember, if you don&rsquo;t admit it next time, I&rsquo;ll really do it~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it properly next time! So, please&#8230; don&rsquo;t press your chest against my arm! It makes me more restless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, honesty is the best policy~. Want a reward? I could press against you even more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not okay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tsk~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, in the end, I&rsquo;m always defeated as usual.</p>

<p>And before I know it, the elevator arrives at the third floor, and our first visit to the bar begins.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;For starters, could we get two sweet and easy-to-drink ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai and I quickly take our seats at the counter. Without even looking at the menu, Senpai orders a sweet drink, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel her sophistication.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite experienced, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you get used to it if you come twice a month~. I can&rsquo;t remember the names of the cocktails though, so I always just tell the bartender my preferences and leave it up to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem like a mature woman, and I think that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Then I guess I don&rsquo;t need to bother remembering the names of cocktails~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you should at least remember your favorite cocktail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I say with a sigh as Senpai declares with a carefree smile and casual tone that she won&rsquo;t bother remembering cocktail names.</p>

<p>As always, I&rsquo;m left in amazement at Senpai&rsquo;s attitude.</p>

<p>Despite her mature appearance and gestures, her conversation reveals a childlike nature.</p>

<p> This gap in my Senpai&rsquo;s character leaves me both exasperated and unexpectedly thrilled&mdash;perhaps because I&rsquo;m fond of any kind of Senpai.</p>

<p>The quiet yet underground vibe of the bar amplifies this feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, why don&rsquo;t you learn something new today and teach it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve decided that from now on, I&rsquo;ll only come here when I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right after Senpai&rsquo;s words, a peach cocktail, a Fuzzy Navel, is silently placed on the counter.</p>

<p>The first cocktail I drank after clinking glasses was sweeter than I imagined&#8230; and it made me recall a deep kiss shared with Senpai, one that was laced with the taste of alcohol.</p>

<p>&mdash;Come to think of it, we were drinking peach liquor at that time.</p>

<p>Muttering this to myself, I took another sip of the sweet cocktail.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Next, I&rsquo;ll have a Peach Fizz, and for this man next to me, a Cassis Orange, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai and I quickly finished our rich peach cocktails, the Fuzzy Navels.</p>

<p>Unlike me, who was feeling a bit tormented by the memory of our peach liquor-flavored kiss, Senpai, who was accustomed to drinking, ordered the next drink as if it were nothing.</p>

<p>Senpai continued with a peach-based cocktail while I was given an orange cocktail with a name I seemed to have heard somewhere before.</p>

<p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect, and at that moment, I didn&rsquo;t really care.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This man next to me.&rsquo; (tonari no kare)</p>

<p> I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a jolt at the casual way Senpai used that phrase.</p>

<p>Was it referring to me as a boyfriend or just as a person next to her?</p>

<p>I hoped it was the former.</p>

<p>While harboring such greedy thoughts, I gripped Senpai&rsquo;s hand even tighter, conveying my anxious feelings directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; Senpai? Is it really okay to drink so quickly? With the alcohol and everything&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you worried about the money? If that&rsquo;s the case, you don&rsquo;t have to worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you say so, I&rsquo;m still worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehehe, Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;re so kind~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this really the time for teasing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had been in the bar for only ten minutes.</p>

<p>My glass was still half full, while Senpai&rsquo;s was already empty.</p>

<p>No matter how much one likes sweet drinks, drinking at a bar is different from drinking at home.</p>

<p> The more you drink, the more money you spend, with no limit.</p>

<p>Despite being told before coming that &ldquo;money is no concern,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help but worry.</p>

<p>Yet, Kureha Senpai only looked at me with melting eyes while gently stroking my tightly held hand, seemingly without a care in the world.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand how she could be so relaxed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s all good. Nothing like what you&rsquo;re thinking will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you say so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But maybe I should clear things up if you&rsquo;re too worried about money to focus on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing me still anxious despite her loving gaze, Senpai brought over a menu that had been lying face down on the counter.</p>

<p>On it was written, &ldquo;University Students Special! All-you-can-drink cocktails for 2,000 yen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, all-you-can-drink for 2,000 yen&#8230;? For cocktails!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Surprised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than surprising! And it looks like there&rsquo;s no time limit written here either&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The owner decided on this to encourage word-of-mouth. Well, as you can see, despite being in a back alley, it&rsquo;s not really attracting crowds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was beyond surprising. An all-you-can-drink deal with no time limit.</p>

<p>You could enjoy cocktails, which normally take more effort to prepare than regular drinks, to your heart&rsquo;s content for just two thousand yen. And it wasn&rsquo;t just cocktails&mdash;beer and sake were also unlimited.</p>

<p>It was the kind of generosity that made you question the sanity of the owner.</p>

<p> Even if it was a promotional stunt to attract customers, it would surely be the perfect spot for anyone who loved a good drink.</p>

<p>In reality, due to the eerie neon lights and its back alley location, there were hardly any people around&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry for the wait, here&rsquo;s your Peach Fizz and Cassis Orange. Please continue to enjoy your time at your leisure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While we were talking, the drinks Senpai had ordered arrived.</p>

<p> I downed the remaining Fuzzy Navel in my glass and handed over my empty glass along with Senpai&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Seeing my actions, Senpai spoke with a satisfied look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about money anymore, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though they were sweet drinks, alcohol was still alcohol.</p>

<p>My head, which had been clear until a moment ago, was starting to feel a bit fuzzy.</p>

<p>At the same time, I felt a slight surge of boldness within me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, you&rsquo;ll be able to immerse yourself in drinking with me, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s our first time together at a bar. I want to spend a nice time getting thoroughly and slowly drunk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too&#8230; want to enjoy the drinks slowly with you. Senpai!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, look at you, all excited and nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one to talk, Senpai. You&rsquo;re just as excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As usual, I responded to Senpai&rsquo;s teasing while casually throwing back a retort.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that I had planned to get back at her, it just happened before I realized it.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s body was felt through our intertwined arms. It was her usual tactic to deliberately make me restless.</p>

<p>However, it seemed Senpai wasn&rsquo;t as composed as usual behind her appearance, as her ears were slightly red.</p>

<p>I knew very well that this wasn&rsquo;t the redness of being drunk. When Senpai got drunk, her cheeks would flush.</p>

<p>The redness of her ears now was from genuine embarrassment.</p>

<p>But I had let my guard down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural&#8230; I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to holding hands like this for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> I should have known Senpai wouldn&rsquo;t just let herself be outdone.</p>

<p>I gulped down the Cassis Orange placed in front of me immediately&#8230; to avoid meeting the triumphant gaze of the red-eared Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hiding your embarrassment with a drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not to hide my embarrassment! I just wanted to check the taste with a sip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell me, what does it taste like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh, you can&rsquo;t even say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I had taken a sip not because I couldn&rsquo;t look at her face&#8230; I just needed an excuse.</p>

<p>The Cassis Orange I had taken a sip of quickly passed through my throat, only accelerating my intoxication.</p>

<p>Still, there was no way Senpai, the confident Kureha Senpai, would stop her attack.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought getting a little drunk would make you more honest. Maybe I really need to make you understand with my chest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With those words, she slowly moved our clasped hands toward her firmly guarded chest.</p>

<p>I knew what lay beneath the sturdy clothing&mdash;I knew it all too well.</p>

<p>The time when my wrist was guided into that cleavage, softly trapped and her fingertips circled around it.</p>

<p>The sensation from that time came back to me without even trying to remember, and another layer of frustration built up.</p>

<p>To shake it off, I began to spill my true feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right! It&rsquo;s my way of hiding my embarrassment! I wanted to go on a date holding hands with Senpai like this, and I wanted to spend a leisurely evening together, so I can&rsquo;t help but feel incredibly happy right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p> After speaking my true feelings, I felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, that makes me happy~. When you say things like that, it makes me want to tease you even more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s teasing smile, our hands still softly joined in a lover&rsquo;s clasp on the countertop.</p>

<p>The taste of alcohol, coated with a Fuzzy Navel, on lips that casually nudge closer and hips that subtly press against each other.</p>

<p>In this dark, mature atmosphere, I&rsquo;ve completely fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Tease me as much as you want until you&rsquo;re satisfied, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wonder what would happen if I just let myself get drunk&#8230;</p>

<p>As I ponder this, I sink deeper into a mire of thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, I&rsquo;m fine with being Senpai&rsquo;s toy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Admitting that even on my memorable bar debut, I&rsquo;m no match for Senpai.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, open up~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Y-Yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit strong, so be careful when you swallow~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-Yes&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, gulp it down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, phew&#8230; It&rsquo;s sour but easy to drink&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surrendering myself to the intoxication of the alcohol, I was at the point where Senpai had to bring the glass to my lips for me to drink by the third drink.</p>

<p>Without feeling any discomfort in being fed, I simply react to the flavor of the alcohol spreading in my mouth as if it&rsquo;s the right thing for me to do.</p>

<p>Even as I swallow the Hassaku orange liquor down my throat, that feeling doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, good boy~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything for you if it pleases Senpai&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai gently strokes my head, and it&rsquo;s the best reward, making me think, &lsquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s okay to just stay fallen like this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, you&rsquo;re nicely drunk~. You&rsquo;ve got me feeling tipsy too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, you get all wobbly when you&rsquo;re drunk, huh? It&rsquo;s a bit of an unusual way to get drunk, but it&rsquo;s very you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything, you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s too drunk~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love Senpai in any state, so it&rsquo;s okay even if you get more wobbly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, in her tipsy state, seems somewhat restless, and her usual teasing expression is nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The redness of her ears has spread to her cheeks, and the warmth I feel in the palm of my hand from Senpai&rsquo;s body is a little higher than usual.</p>

<p>Our entwined fingers begin to fidget as if trying to escape somewhere.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no sign of turning away, but there&rsquo;s a sense that Senpai wants to divert her attention.</p>

<p> I recognize this peculiar behavior in Senpai.</p>

<p> &ldquo;A-ahaha&#8230; Well, this is a bit of a problem&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai scratches her neck with her free hand, her mouth relaxing into a smile contrary to her words.</p>

<p>That must be what it means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai? Are you blushing by any chance~? The Senpai who&rsquo;s always teasing is actually embarrassed now~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having found a way to tease Senpai, I let myself get carried away by the alcohol, eager to get back at her for all the times she&rsquo;s teased me.</p>

<p>As a result, I lost control over my emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Takashi-kun, I am blushing. You really have to be careful with alcohol. Even if I try to keep my feelings of happiness in check, I can&rsquo;t suppress them as well once I start drinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a bit much to direct your happiness into teasing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you still enjoy it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to see Senpai being honest too~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit too honest when you&rsquo;re drunk, Takashi-kun. Well, I like that about you too~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you too, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even when I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by alcohol, even when I can no longer hide my feelings, even when I get too carried away, Senpai remains calm.</p>

<p>In contrast, I can&rsquo;t control my emotions well and end up saying exactly what&rsquo;s on my mind.</p>

<p>I want to see an honest Senpai more than being teased. And above all, I seriously like Senpai.</p>

<p>Even if I say &ldquo;I like you&rdquo; in our daily life, I feel like it&rsquo;s not getting through properly, and I worry that my &ldquo;like&rdquo; is being taken as just &ldquo;like&rdquo; and not &ldquo;love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though we live together, that anxiety doesn&rsquo;t easily subside.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t understand why Senpai started going out with me. &lsquo;Because I like teasing you&rsquo;, she says, but that doesn&rsquo;t quite resonate with me.</p>

<p> What about when she&rsquo;s not teasing?</p>

<p>Right now, in this very moment, when she&rsquo;s not teasing me&#8230; does she still like me?</p>

<p>Along with my feelings for Senpai, my anxiety also spirals out of control.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t show her the negative side because I don&rsquo;t want to be disliked by Senpai.</p>

<p>No matter what Senpai thinks of me, as long as I&rsquo;m not disliked, that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m thinking this, Senpai casually raises her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, could we get this next, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Please wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Different from before, Kureha Senpai points at the menu and orders something.</p>

<p>Is it my imagination, or does Senpai feel warmer than before?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you order this time~? Another sweet drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a sweet drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really like them, huh~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do like sweet things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I ask Senpai out of curiosity what she ordered, her reply is somewhat monotonous, just repeating what was asked.</p>

<p>The teasing Senpai, looking for an opportunity to tease, was not present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, shall we drink together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Together&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of me is my older girlfriend, drowned in sweet alcohol.</p>

<p>With her deep red hair tied to the side and an elusive smile that shakes my heart, between us is just a single drink.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you are. Kahlua milk with a couple&rsquo;s straw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A heart-shaped arch formed by two straws stuck into a sweet, easy-to-drink cocktail known as a &lsquo;lady killer&rsquo;.</p>

<p>And the target this time is me, a man&mdash;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230; my head&rsquo;s getting all fuzzy&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve been drinking a lot~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But strangely, I feel like I can keep drinking if I&rsquo;m with Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to drink, but it&rsquo;s high in alcohol content, so be careful, okay? Though, I guess it&rsquo;s pointless to say that now since you&rsquo;ve already had quite a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to remember all of Senpai&rsquo;s favorite flavors&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, okay~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kahlua Milk.</p>

<p>Despite its smooth taste, it&rsquo;s actually a drink with a high alcohol content.</p>

<p>Unlike beer or fruit wines, it has very little of bitterness or distinct taste often associated with alcohol, which has led to its misuse by men, earning it the nickname &ldquo;Lady Killer&rdquo; for its potency in intoxicating women.</p>

<p>Ironically, the one being &ldquo;killed&rdquo; by it right now is me, a guy.</p>

<p>Sitting next to me, Kureha Senpai is like a cunning female leopard, making her prey feel good and slowly waiting for the chance to pounce.</p>

<p>Just being on a date with Kureha Senpai had me on cloud nine. Add to that the continuous softness of Kureha Senpai I could feel against my arm and the sweet alcohol that could bring back memories of that kiss.</p>

<p>All the conditions were more than enough for Senpai to capture me.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t feel bad about the situation at all.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I was even hoping that Senpai would have her way with me soon.</p>

<p> Suppose I could dissipate the frustration from the incident with Yuu over the barbecue right here. Even if I couldn&rsquo;t let go of everything&#8230; if it made Senpai feel better&#8230;</p>

<p>My melted brain was sinking further.</p>

<p>In the midst of that, a familiar voice came from behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, are you okay? Oh, it&rsquo;s Takashi! What are you doing getting so smashed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh&#8230; Yuu, what are you doing here&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is where I work. I heard there was a lovey-dovey college couple getting wasted, so I thought I&rsquo;d come over with some water to sober them up and check out the scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like you, Yuu. I can&rsquo;t even find anything to retort. Thanks to you, I&rsquo;m a bit more sober now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, sober up completely. I don&rsquo;t want to see my best friend all love-struck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu&rsquo;s familiar tomboyish tone.</p>

<p>I slowly turned my drunken head to look behind and there stood my best friend, Sonoda Yuu, in her usual hoodie and waiter&rsquo;s outfit.</p>

<p>Despite being in front of customers, she didn&rsquo;t seem to care and kept throwing insults at me as if we were back at the university.</p>

<p>Gradually, my head began to clear.</p>

<p>Probably because the &lsquo;space alone with Kureha Senpai&rsquo; was no longer there.</p>

<p>The unconscious reassurance that nothing could come between me and Kureha Senpai might have been accelerating my intoxication.</p>

<p> Then, things that hadn&rsquo;t bothered me before suddenly started to bother me.</p>

<p>For example, Yuu&rsquo;s outfit.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find out that Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s regular bar was Yuu&rsquo;s workplace, but it was even more curious that she didn&rsquo;t take off her hoodie and wasn&rsquo;t even dressed as a waitress.</p>

<p>She probably didn&rsquo;t think I would care about such things.</p>

<p>She laughed carelessly, showing no signs of leaving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; what exactly is your relationship with Takashi-kun&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Perhaps reaching her limit of patience, Senpai spoke to Yuu with a displeased look, trying to fend her off.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai probably wanted to be alone with me too.</p>

<p>I could sense that, but it seemed that Yuu didn&rsquo;t catch on to Senpai&rsquo;s intentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you this idiot&rsquo;s girlfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry for monopolizing him the other day. I was just so annoyed that this guy was having all the fun and skipping class, so I took it out on him by dragging him to a barbecue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve heard all about it from Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite having finished our conversation, Yuu showed no signs of leaving.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she kept glaring back and forth between Kureha Senpai and me as if she was appraising something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, aren&rsquo;t you going to take off your hood? I believe it&rsquo;s customer service time now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said my companion next to me, irritation evident in her voice.</p>

<p>Perhaps triggered by Senpai&rsquo;s words, Yuu responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bit of a situation, so I&rsquo;d rather not take it off. I know it&rsquo;s not the best look, but I usually work behind the counter, so please forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu said, apologizing while pulling her hood down deeper as if she didn&rsquo;t want to show her face.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai seemed to sense something in her behavior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. You have your own circumstances too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. We should be heading back soon. Is the bill alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Kureha Senpai stood up, ready to leave. In a rush, I also began preparing to leave.</p>

<p>With the mood sobered, I had no desire to get drunk on sweet alcohol again.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about the payment. I&rsquo;ll have the manager cover it since a friend has come today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we really shouldn&rsquo;t&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an apology for the trouble I caused through Takashi the other day. Besides, I won&rsquo;t be satisfied until I do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you insist&#8230; I won&rsquo;t refuse the service then&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just accept it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a bit miffed watching my lover and best friend chatting away as if they were old friends.</p>
