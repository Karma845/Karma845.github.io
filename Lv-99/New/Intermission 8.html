<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p> &ldquo;A proper relationship, huh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, as I was up early as usual making breakfast, I mulled over my father&rsquo;s words from yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make sure you maintain a proper relationship with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel annoyed at those words directed at Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>My father thought he knew him without knowing anything about him.</p>

<p>He was just rejecting everything outright, casting a prejudiced view not only on me but also on the person I liked.</p>

<p>How could he possibly understand the good in Takashi-kun?</p>

<p> The person I like is only understood by those who try to understand him.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s the type whose charm you only feel when you accept him and try to get closer.</p>

<p>To someone who doesn&rsquo;t try to understand, Takashi-kun&rsquo;s qualities will remain unknown, and it feels like it&rsquo;s hard to make an effort to explain to such a person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, what should I do&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never imagined my father would be the type of person I have trouble with.</p>

<p>Normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t care and would just keep my distance, but I don&rsquo;t want to treat my father that way.</p>

<p>After all, he&rsquo;s one of the two parents who raised me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s frustrating that he doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I don&rsquo;t want to be interrupted again.&rdquo;</p>

<p> A bad idea suddenly crosses my mind. I know it&rsquo;s wrong in my head.</p>

<p>But I can&rsquo;t stop it. The more I think about it, the more I want to act on this impulse.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I want to trouble anyone. I just want to be alone with Takashi-kun.</p>

<p> That simple wish lends a sense of reality to my bad idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is Sunday, and tomorrow is a holiday&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I check the calendar and calculate the minimum amount of time we can spend together.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more unstoppable my thoughts become.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason left to stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have fun wherever I stay with Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the rice cooker chimes, I make up my mind to go somewhere far away without telling my parents.</p>

<p>If I want to snuggle up with Takashi-kun without anyone disturbing us, then a bold move is necessary.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay. After all, I&rsquo;m an adult, not a child anymore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehehe, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it~&rdquo;</p>

<p>For breakfast today, it&rsquo;s dashi chazuke.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a special chazuke seasoned with the saltiness of yesterday&rsquo;s failed attempt at buri daikon.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my way and a manifestation of my feelings to put an end to yesterday&rsquo;s matter.</p>
