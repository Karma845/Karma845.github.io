<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I did something a little mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I close my eyes, I see my lover, his face contorted in discomfort. Yet, he also seems to be enjoying it.</p>

<p>Seeing him make such a pained expression, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little malicious.</p>

<p>But even so, he insisted it was a reward, right up to the limit.</p>

<p>Hearing that, I can&rsquo;t help but want to be even more wickedly serious.</p>

<p>It still makes me feel guilty even it&rsquo;s the result of a feeling of loneliness left alone in the living room.</p>

<p>It must have been tough for him. He must have been panicked when I held him back from going to the restroom.</p>

<p> It must have been hard to endure.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m sorry, Takashi-kun. Just a little bit.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to understand, even if it&rsquo;s just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still have a long way to go&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just seeing you next to another girl squeezes my heart so tight.</p>

<p>Even if it means narrowing your circle of friends, my jealousy gets the better of me&#8230;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>I love you more seriously than you might think&#8230;</p>

<p>Sigh. I take a deep breath.</p>

<p>I need to calm my nerves before Takashi-kun comes back, or I&rsquo;ll end up causing him more distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Takashi-kun is angry&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> I caress the spot where Takashi-kun was sitting just moments ago, over and over with the palm of my hand.</p>

<p> Even as I feel the warmth fading, I can&rsquo;t let go. I don&rsquo;t want to let go.</p>

<p>Even if Takashi-kun&rsquo;s warmth is no longer directed at me, I want to stay by his side forever.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a life without Takashi-kun anymore. I&rsquo;m completely addicted to Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>I always think about Takashi-kun, wanting to see his troubled face, but the fear of being disliked is unbearable, and when I&rsquo;m alone like this, the anxiety is overwhelming.</p>

<p>When Takashi-kun is by my side, I feel good, but I start thinking about unpleasant things as soon as we&rsquo;re apart.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since this kind of life began.</p>

<p>A year has passed, but my addiction to Takashi-kun has only accelerated.</p>

<p>Even though I know he&rsquo;s in the same house, being together makes me never want to be apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230; I still have a long way to go&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thump. I lay my whole body down where the warmth is nearly gone.</p>

<p>Faintly, I can smell his scent.</p>

<p>Ah, you really were patient with me.</p>

<p>With a sense of guilt, I can feel his conscientiousness, having endured to the very limit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Hehe. I&rsquo;m no match for your tolerance, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart swells. Even though we&rsquo;re apart, I can feel Takashi-kun and my heartbeat quickens.</p>

<p>Ah, I need to take another deep breath.</p>

<p>Yet, unlike before, I found myself smiling right now.</p>
