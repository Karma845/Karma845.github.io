<h2>Chapter 7: Love Calls</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmn&#8230; is it morning already&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I woke up, I found myself lying on a fluffy bed.</p>

<p>The bed was always cozy just before falling asleep, thanks to the warm air blower that Senpai sets up every night.</p>

<p>Sleep was comfortable, and breakfast was somehow always prepared without me noticing.</p>

<p>Despite her bad drinking habits and excessive teasing, Senpai was a reliable lover. I felt unworthy of her.</p>

<p>Today, as usual, I expected to leave the bed and find a warm breakfast while my beloved Senpai was waiting in the living room.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it was supposed to be&#8230;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Good morning, Takashi-kun. Did you sleep well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&#8230; thanks to you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;thanks to you&rsquo;? The futon? Or something else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m talking about the bed that Senpai prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could at least lie and say &lsquo;I slept well thinking about Kureha. That&rsquo;s why my body and soul was refreshed,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Senpai, you can always tell when I&rsquo;m lying, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai had been waiting for me to wake up right in front of me.</p>

<p>As soon as my eyes opened and focused, she smiled at me.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back, and we chatted about trivial things without getting out of bed while I carefully avoided looking at a certain spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting up? You have university today, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I&rsquo;ll get up when Senpai gets up.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh, but I was planning to get up when you did~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, we were in the same bed this morning. But that was a trivial issue.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, I was bound to spend the whole night on the same bed with Senpai.</p>

<p>Of course, that was my desire, and Senpai probably saw right through it.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why she must have slipped out of her prepared futon and into my bed where I was sleeping.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t mind. I liked being coddled by Senpai, and I liked her teasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not going to call me by my first name without honorifics?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230; Maybe when I feel like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like when you&rsquo;re drinking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No comment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had become quite accustomed to being reminded of the previous night&rsquo;s events fueled by alcohol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night you were all over me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Takashi-kun was so cute last night~,&rdquo; she would say every morning.</p>

<p>So, I no longer got as flustered as I did at the beginning.</p>

<p>I might avert my eyes, but it&rsquo;s only because I don&rsquo;t have the courage to look directly at Senpai&rsquo;s cuteness first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Surely, the day will come when I can look into Senpai&rsquo;s eyes and say &ldquo;Good morning, Kureha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to get there, I have to overcome numerous obstacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I ask for one more thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Of course, go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you look this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For instance, consider this&mdash;Senpai has somehow ended up naked under my futon.</p>

<p>No, maybe she&rsquo;s not naked.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to believe, but I&rsquo;ve long since passed the stage of wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Firstly, there&rsquo;s the closeness. The sensation of being hugged feels different from usual as if there are two fewer layers of clothing.</p>

<p>Secondly, the softness. A level of softness that distinctly surpasses what I&rsquo;ve felt countless times before.</p>

<p>Lastly, Senpai&rsquo;s tone of voice. That sweet, devilish tone she uses when she&rsquo;s clearly teasing me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, letting the fluffy blanket slip to give a glimpse of her cleavage.</p>

<p>The morning sunlight streaming through the curtains highlights Senpai&rsquo;s defenseless and soft form, accentuating the shape of her breasts.</p>

<p> Ah, see, I knew it.</p>

<p>Caught up in Senpai&rsquo;s movements, I hastily turn my face away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? If you&rsquo;re curious, you could just look, you know~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;L-look&#8230; There&rsquo;s no way I can just look!! Besides, if I did, I think I&rsquo;d lose control over all sorts of things. I&rsquo;m trying to endure here!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, on the other hand, would welcome it~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s not welcoming it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What started as a refreshing morning has turned into an overly stimulating one.</p>

<p>I resist while vehemently turning my face away from Senpai, who, for her part, tries to guide my gaze towards her.</p>

<p>But we both know. I know I&rsquo;ve seen, and she knows she wants to be seen.</p>

<p> Yet neither of us can be honest, and we just continue this battle in bed.</p>

<p>Senpai, taking advantage of being naked, rubs her skin against me, tempting me, while I, determined not to lose to the temptation, close my eyes and wait for Senpai to get bored.</p>

<p>The current time is seven in the morning.</p>

<p>Normally, it&rsquo;s time for breakfast, but neither Senpai nor I give in.</p>

<p>Of course, the advantage lies with Kureha Senpai. While I can only endure, Senpai is free to attack as she pleases.</p>

<p>If she targeted the bulge against my trousers, I&rsquo;d be utterly helpless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Takashi-kun, fight back~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want me to fight back, at least put on some clothes&#8230;! And why aren&rsquo;t you wearing any in the first place?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s obvious, isn&rsquo;t it? I wanted to see you flustered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This person just says it so blatantly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In bed, I&rsquo;m still being toyed with by my naked lover.</p>

<p>Or rather, I&rsquo;m being kneaded and played with, from my stomach to my chest.</p>

<p>Even if we have a playful relationship, being continuously manipulated like this does take its toll on me.</p>

<p>Even if it&rsquo;s something that would please Senpai.</p>

<p>Just as Senpai wants to tease me as Senpai, I too want to behave as a boyfriend and a man should, regardless of how Kureha Senpai might react.</p>

<p>And Kureha Senpai, far from being dissatisfied with my reaction, reveals a satisfied smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;this person,&rsquo; call me &lsquo;Kureha.&rsquo; Then maybe I&rsquo;ll consider putting on some clothes~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she adds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be that you snuck into the futon for that reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being unusually clear about it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer that came back to my tentative question left me with no choice but to be astonished.</p>

<p>While I averted my face, my eyes still sought to capture Senpai&rsquo;s expression.</p>

<p> I tried to divert my attention from Senpai&rsquo;s nakedness wrapped in the blanket, but I couldn&rsquo;t escape from Senpai herself. And Kureha Senpai had no intention of letting me go either.</p>

<p>It had only been a few weeks since we started living together, but that was more than enough time to understand the extent of Senpai&rsquo;s attachment to me.</p>

<p>Still, there was a long way to go as I would continue to discover new facets of Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geez! I&rsquo;ve told you to call me &lsquo;Kureha&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m seriously going to make my move!? I didn&rsquo;t say it before, but it&rsquo;s totally obvious that you&rsquo;re getting excited, okay??&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it good manners not to mention that kind of thing!? And as for the name, please wait a bit longer!! I&rsquo;m not ready for that yet&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, when? When will you call me &lsquo;Kureha&rsquo; sober?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a week&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rub it if it gets big, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I really need time to prepare my heart!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230; I&rsquo;ll let it slide for now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phew&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For instance, Senpai had started to show an unusual fixation on being called by her name.</p>

<p> Perhaps she liked it when I called her &lsquo;Kureha&rsquo; in my drunken state yesterday, because now she was using my embarrassing excitement as a bargaining chip to make me call her by her name again.</p>

<p>Luckily, my desperate feelings got through, and for now, I was spared from having to call her by her name immediately. But it was only a matter of time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I dislike calling Senpai by her name.</p>

<p>In fact, when I called her &lsquo;Kureha&rsquo; yesterday, I felt an indescribable happiness.</p>

<p>Even if that joy was alcohol-induced, I&rsquo;m not such a fool as to feel nothing when Senpai shows her affectionate side.</p>

<p>However, a mix of resistance and embarrassment wells up inside me when it comes to casually saying it in everyday life.</p>

<p>At the very least, I wanted some time to practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting in the kitchen and make breakfast then. Takashi-kun, take your time and come to the living room when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for putting up with my selfishness today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was lost in thought, Senpai had already slipped out of the bed and the door to the living room creaked open.</p>

<p>I glanced towards the door, keeping my gaze on the floor so as not to accidentally see Senpai&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>In the corner of my eye, I could barely make out her slender arms holding jeans and a knit sweater.</p>

<p>Ah, it was really good that I didn&rsquo;t let my guard down&#8230;</p>

<p>Feeling a bit relieved, I also wished that I could be spared such intense mornings in the future as I watched Senpai leave the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The selfish one is me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I muttered my own frustrating indecisiveness&#8230;</p>

<p>Afterward, I began to relieve myself, which had become embarrassingly excited due to Senpai&rsquo;s relentless advances.</p>

<p> Even as I was manipulated by Senpai, the target of my actions was not Senpai but a few pieces of tissue I had prepared.</p>

<p>I knew it was pathetic, yet I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to act otherwise, feeling pitiful about my cowardice.</p>

<p> I knew very well. I was painfully aware of my own cowardice.</p>

<p>Yet despite that, the more I thought of Senpai, the hotter my arousal grew, gathering moisture from within my body.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the image of Senpai&rsquo;s naked body crosses my mind.</p>

<p>The soft yet beautiful skin of her chest that I glimpsed when the futon slipped open and Senpai&rsquo;s outstanding proportions accentuated by the futon wrapped around her.</p>

<p>My other self grows more excited as my feelings intensify.</p>

<p>Unable to stop myself, I release my thoughts onto several scraps of tissue.</p>

<p>Despite feeling pathetic, I somehow feel refreshed.</p>

<p>After letting out my feelings, I head to the living room where Senpai is waiting.</p>

<p>Knowing Senpai, a delicious breakfast is probably already prepared.</p>

<p>With that thought, I open the door to the living room, and as expected, there&rsquo;s a freshly made breakfast&mdash;and&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, did you have a refreshing morning, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one thing we agreed not to say!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, it&rsquo;s payback for not calling me by my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Payback&#8230;?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dressed in a pink apron, with her pert bottom clearly outlined even through her jeans, my one-year senior girlfriend, Kureha, turns to me with a mischievous expression.</p>

<p>Ah, I really can&rsquo;t compete with Senpai&mdash;Kureha.</p>

<p>As I cursed my own weakness for only being able to call her by her name in my mind, I realized that I actually enjoyed being teased by Senpai.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes in the morning that made me feel this way.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what got into you today? You were more aggressive than usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh~ I thought I was just being normal~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to play it off. I know you were grinning and doing it on purpose!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sharp, Takashi-kun. You wouldn&rsquo;t even look at me earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t just look at you naked&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While grumbling about this morning&rsquo;s incident, Senpai and I enjoyed our breakfast.</p>

<p>Raisin nut toast that belied its frozen food origins, stir-fried spinach and eggs, and potato potage soup.</p>

<p>Ever since I started living with Senpai, I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to breakfast.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a far cry from the quick calorie bar meals I used to have.</p>

<p>Though, ever since Senpai arrived, I haven&rsquo;t been able to sleep in peace&#8230; Perhaps it&rsquo;s because of mornings like today, when all sleepiness is blown away for various reasons.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been such a big deal if Senpai were just a beautiful woman. I might have had a heart-fluttering morning being gently woken up by her. But Kureha Senpai is more than that.</p>

<p>Not to mention her sexiness, she&rsquo;s very affectionate.</p>

<p>She kisses me when I wake up, hums scenes from erotic magazines into my ear if I don&rsquo;t wake up, and like this morning, slips naked into bed&#8230; Senpai always grins at me with a blush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>Just one gesture from her, and my will to resist is blown away.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been at Senpai&rsquo;s mercy every morning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s stop joking around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit too strong for a joke&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of having a sleepover at Yuu-chan&rsquo;s house today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Yuu&rsquo;s house&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, having finished her breakfast before me, tells me about her plans for the day while soaking the dishes in water.</p>

<p>Her expression is calm but also serious. It&rsquo;s not for teasing; she&rsquo;s serious about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I want to get a bit closer to Yuu-chan. Oh, don&rsquo;t worry. I won&rsquo;t forget my love calls to Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p> She doesn&rsquo;t forget to tease me casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you please stop saying things like you&rsquo;ve always been doing this!? I&rsquo;ve hardly ever received such love calls from you, right?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite confronting my Senpai with the truth, her face unflinchingly confident, she doesn&rsquo;t show any signs of being perturbed.</p>

<p>On the contrary, she grins as if she had been waiting for my retort all along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want me to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do want you to&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if she knew what my answer would be.</p>

<p>A love call from Senpai.</p>

<p>It would be strange not to be interested. Not just for today, but every day, no, I&rsquo;d want it three times a day if possible.</p>

<p>I can feel Senpai&rsquo;s love with just a whisper in my ear.</p>

<p>The sensation is surely indescribable.</p>

<p>She offered me an experience I&rsquo;d never had before, so there was no reason to refuse. No, I never intended to refuse in the first place.</p>

<p> Surely, Senpai must have seen right through me when she suggested the love call. I can&rsquo;t let my guard down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled then. You can send me a love call too when you feel lonely, okay, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a given that there will be love calls&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;If you say you want me to, then I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-okay, I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be the one to feel lonely first and end up making a love call to Senpai.</p>

<p>Imagining all the possible futures as I ponder what Senpai does in Yuu&rsquo;s room during the times she&rsquo;s not with me. I reach my limit&#8230;</p>

<p>Looking into Senpai&rsquo;s eyes as I imagine these scenarios, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a warmth deep in my chest.</p>

<p>In the end, I was teased for it when I made an early love call during lunch brea&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; I&rsquo;m so bored&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>University is over, and now it&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>Lying on the sofa with no particular purpose, I feel like a melting slime.</p>

<p>Lethargic, lifeless, and just existing there.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become &ldquo;something&rdquo; in the shape of a person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Senpai is not in the room, it&rsquo;s this boring, huh&#8230; I finished eating in no time, and I&rsquo;ve already completed my assignments at the university. What should I do now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps because I&rsquo;ve gotten used to eating with Senpai, I&rsquo;ve started to eat breakfast properly, and the smell of hamburgers I cooked lingers in the kitchen despite the ventilation fan running.</p>

<p> Maybe because cuddling with Senpai in the room has become a daily routine, I&rsquo;ve developed the habit of finishing my assignments and studies at the university first.</p>

<p> As a result, I find myself with almost nothing to do at home because Senpai is not here today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some contemplation, I decide to indulge in another of my daily routines: having a drink in the evening.</p>

<p>I take out a sweet drink from the kitchen storage that Senpai likes. But I don&rsquo;t just stop there.</p>

<p>I suddenly had an idea and went through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m at it, why not mix them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What I brought from the kitchen was peach liquor and citrus liquor. I pour them one-to-one into a glass, both bottles already half empty.</p>

<p>Peach and citrus. It&rsquo;s not an unusual combination. They&rsquo;re even sold mixed in canned forms.</p>

<p>The thick flow of the peach liquor and the refreshing citrus scent of the mandarin orange liquor blend together, creating a tropical atmosphere in the glass.</p>

<p>My mouth waters naturally, and I find myself desiring it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;It&rsquo;s okay, just for today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drinking alcohol in a place without Senpai somehow felt like a taboo that I couldn&rsquo;t shake off.</p>

<p>Although I mixed what should have been Senpai&rsquo;s usual drink, the result was an unfamiliar liquor that exuded an even sweeter aura than usual.</p>

<p>On reflection, this might be the first time I&rsquo;ve ever drunk alone.</p>

<p>With that thought, an unknown fear of the drink in front of me intensified.</p>

<p>Usually, we&rsquo;re sweetly flirting when I&rsquo;m with Senpai, so I&rsquo;ve never felt strongly intoxicated.</p>

<p>No, perhaps it was Senpai&rsquo;s presence that allowed me to disguise my drunkenness, and I never had to face the fear of alcohol.</p>

<p>The drink before me now is fifteen percent alcohol by volume. It&rsquo;s almost the same strength as what I usually drink with Senpai, but the quantity is different.</p>

<p>The situation is different. The feelings are different.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to distance myself from the tropical drink, the moment came.</p>

<p> Ring.</p>

<p>A familiar ringtone. And yet, it was a special one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a call of salvation.</p>

<p>The fact that Senpai would call me at the very moment I was feeling lonely made me mistakenly think that my feelings had somehow reached her, even from afar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi~! Takashi-kun! It&rsquo;s your second love call of the day~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike earlier in the day, it was a video call.</p>

<p>A bright and cheerful Senpai appeared beside an unfamiliar silver-haired beauty who was blushing and waving her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Um, who might this be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh-what do you mean, &lsquo;who&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s me! Yuu!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuu!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was unmistakably Yuu&rsquo;s own. The tone was undeniably Yuu&rsquo;s. And yet, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the scene unfolding before me through the video call.</p>

<p>Yuu who had always stubbornly refused to remove her hood in public was now revealing her face.</p>

<p>And her face was that of a beautiful silver-haired girl, so much so that I couldn&rsquo;t help but be stunned for a moment.</p>

<p>No, it was difficult not to be surprised.</p>

<p>After all, I had answered the phone seeking Senpai, only to be greeted by my best friend&rsquo;s unveiled face.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufufu, surprised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m surprised&#8230; What kind of trick did you use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound so suspicious as if you&rsquo;re doubting your lover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying you haven&rsquo;t done anything suspicious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My lover confidently made a smug face, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but look at her with suspicion first.</p>

<p>It was probably due to Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s usual behavior.</p>

<p> Rather than doubting Senpai, I was worried whether Senpai&rsquo;s usual antics had been directed at Yuu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha Senpai says this, but what&rsquo;s the actual situation, Yuu?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Well, let&rsquo;s just say a lot happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuu-chan!!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As expected, Senpai&rsquo;s teasing nature had also been aimed at Yuu.</p>

<p>On the flip side, it meant that Senpai trusted Yuu enough to do so, which made me happy they got along. But at the same time, part of my heart felt a little cloudy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but don&rsquo;t worry, okay? My body and heart will always belong to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, in the end, my unease is cured with just a few words from Senpai&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s turn back time to six in the evening.</p>

<p>The location is a women-only two-story apartment not far from the university.</p>

<p> In a corner of this men-prohibited Eden, two female university students are giggling and enjoying each other&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re going to have loads of fun today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha-san! Keep it down!! The walls here are thin!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, I think it&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity to show our neighbors how close we are, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point! What if we get a complaint and are asked to leave!!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When that happens, we&rsquo;ll think about it then! If it comes to it, maybe we could crash at Takashi-kun&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a good idea&#8230; I prefer not to involve myself in such situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike a girl who knows when to pull back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flapping her limbs in high spirits, Kureha contrasts with the room&rsquo;s main occupant, Yuu, who is frantically trying to quiet her Senpai down.</p>

<p>Even within her own room, she doesn&rsquo;t remove her trademark hood and listens to Kureha&rsquo;s jokes with an unfazed, detached demeanor.</p>

<p>Satisfied with Yuu&rsquo;s composed reaction, Kureha turns to her with a contented expression.</p>

<p>Yuu lightly brushes it off and leads Kureha to the living room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what brings you here today? Wanting to stay over at my place&#8230; Did something happen with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No sooner had they entered the living room than Yuu broached the main topic.</p>

<p>The night before, she had received a sudden message from her best friend&rsquo;s boyfriend saying, &ldquo;Let me stay over tomorrow,&rdquo; which had left her slightly worried.</p>

<p>Could it be that the incident at Takashi&rsquo;s place still had repercussions&#8230;?</p>

<p>She had agreed to visit her best friend&rsquo;s boyfriend&rsquo;s place too readily.</p>

<p>that was a mistake, wasn&rsquo;t it&#8230; Ah&#8230; I&rsquo;ve done it again&#8230;</p>

<p>Dark thoughts began to swirl in Yuu&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p> Self-loathing. Self-denial. A sense of inferiority.</p>

<p> She felt as if Kureha&rsquo;s presence here was entirely her fault, and she tried to shoulder all the blame while pulling her hood down further.</p>

<p>However, the response she received was the complete opposite of what she had anticipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Takashi-kun and I are still lovey-dovey~? He even gave me a love call because he missed me at lunchtime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is that so&#8230; I&rsquo;m glad to hear you&rsquo;re both so affectionate&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu&rsquo;s fingers relaxed as she listened to Kureha&rsquo;s words, her grip on her hood loosening.</p>

<p>Kureha showed Yuu the call history from Takashi, wiggling her phone playfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun is so cute, getting all flustered and hanging up after just repeating &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; over and over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In someone else&rsquo;s home, Kureha unabashedly gushed with cheeks blushing, while Yuu awkwardly looked away.</p>

<p>But Kureha wasn&rsquo;t one to miss even the slightest change in Yuu&rsquo;s demeanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, enough joking around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were quite serious&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came here because I want to know more about you. To put it plainly, I want us to become closer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without being fazed by Yuu&rsquo;s slightly blunt words, Kureha declared her intention to become closer with a determined face.</p>

<p>Before Yuu stood a certain Senpai, who had transformed so much from the person who had been agonizing over her lover just moments ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really not interesting to know about me. I think you&rsquo;d have much more fun teasing Takashi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fair point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha said with her usual charm, though her expression was dead serious.</p>

<p>Yuu found herself unable to voice any strong objections to such a contrast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I just can&rsquo;t leave it alone. Not with Takashi-kun, and not with you, Yuu-chan.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Is it because you feel sorry for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu managed to ask, probing for Kureha&rsquo;s true intentions. To Yuu, people who approached out of pity were neither rare nor surprising.</p>

<p>Those who habitually wore hoods to avoid the public eye were often treated as spectacles by society.</p>

<p>There were plenty who sought to help such individuals, not out of genuine concern but in hopes of basking in praise.</p>

<p>Some even tried to force Yuu to remove the very hood that was essential to her, despite it being her choice to wear it.</p>

<p>Because of this, Yuu was exceptionally wary of people&rsquo;s gazes and made sure to wear her hood deep enough to conceal her caution.</p>

<p>The looks of &ldquo;pity&rdquo; she received were now among the things she despised the most.</p>

<p>However, the gaze and feelings Kureha directed at Yuu were not of pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s different. I simply want to know why you keep your hood on and push people away, Yuu-chan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do with that knowledge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if it&rsquo;s something Yuu-chan wants to do, then there&rsquo;s no need to forcibly change it. I feel the same way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe it was pure curiosity. Kureha was simply asking something without any harmful intentions or the desire to intervene.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was all it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love to tease the people I adore. Even if they dislike it, I want them to love me for who I am, in my entirety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s a choice made to be oneself, then that&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why Kureha is who she is and why she doesn&rsquo;t stop teasing, no matter how much Takashi may frown upon it.</p>

<p>She teases because she loves. She wants to be loved for the teasing.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simply who I am, and it&rsquo;s what I want to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha stated with a smug look on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you, Yuu-chan? Are you okay with how things are? Or is there something you want to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding those words, Kureha waited for a response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t want to be treated as someone special.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu confessed, her voice spilling out from beneath the hood, tinged with loneliness.</p>

<p>It was a fragile tone, completely different from her usual assertive manner when speaking to a close friend.</p>

<p> Yet, it conveyed her deep sincerity to the person she faced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me more? It&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m definitely on your side, Yuu-chan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230;? You won&rsquo;t change your mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like people who try hard. I love those who strive and strive to change their situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Takashi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Takashi-kun too. I always get butterflies when I see Takashi-kun trying not to be teased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Contrary to the affectionate talk of a lover, Kureha&rsquo;s eyes were sharp.</p>

<p>While occasionally steering the conversation away, Kureha seemed completely immersed in Yuu&rsquo;s troubles.</p>

<p>There was none of the sloppiness that she showed in front of Takashi.</p>

<p>On the contrary, there was even a coolness to Kureha&rsquo;s overly serious expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, no matter how hard Yuu-chan tries, I won&rsquo;t change my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> Yuu couldn&rsquo;t help but falter in her words, taken aback by Kureha uncharacteristic attitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sorry, let me correct that. My feelings might change, actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I might end up feeling all fluttery about Yuu-chan, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, haha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu stumbled over her words again as Kureha abruptly reverted to her usual self.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So~? What&rsquo;s been troubling you, Yuu-chan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha pressed on, seizing the moment as Yuu wore a look of anxiety.</p>

<p>But still, her intonation was different from when she spoke to Takashi, showing genuine concern for Yuu&rsquo;s troubles.</p>

<p>It was a voice meant to break the tension, nothing like the one she used when she wanted to be spoiled by Takashi. And Yuu, who had witnessed Kureha&rsquo;s changing tone in front of Takashi, understood the intention behind Kureha&rsquo;s current voice&mdash;it was meant to calm her down.</p>

<p>In response to Kureha&rsquo;s thoughtfulness, Yuu slowly began to reveal what she had been hiding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, well&#8230; it&rsquo;s this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s white!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hair of the girl who removed her hood was pure white, just as Kureha had exclaimed.</p>

<p>It was a natural color, not dyed, but the girl&rsquo;s face was flushed with embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, is this your natural hair? Can I touch it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-Yes, you can&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t hold back~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu, who hadn&rsquo;t shown her white natural hair to anyone outside her family for months, maybe even years, was at the peak of her embarrassment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kureha was curious as she reached out to touch the girl&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>As soon as she was allowed, she gently stroked Yuu&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Yuu&rsquo;s hair, pure white and shimmering as if sanctified, was so fine and well-kept that Kureha naturally doubted it was natural.</p>

<p>The quality of the hair is thin yet strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, it&rsquo;s nice. So silky~. Well-maintained and delicate! I&rsquo;m jealous!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha continued to stroke Yuu&rsquo;s head with a covetous look in her eyes, reminiscent of her own hair.</p>

<p>Kureha had beautiful, bright red hair, but she didn&rsquo;t like her own hair&mdash;not the color, but the texture.</p>

<p>Contrary to its lovely color, her hair was coarse and difficult to care for.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel envious of Yuu&rsquo;s glossy hair quality.</p>

<p>However, Yuu was surprised by Kureha&rsquo;s reaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;is that all&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, aren&rsquo;t you going to say things like&#8230; &lsquo;You look like a foreigner&rsquo; or &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t look Japanese&rsquo;&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu found herself unable to suppress her worries any longer.</p>

<p>It was a complex, to say the least. She had a head of white hair, a rarity among Japanese people.</p>

<p>Viewed as a curiosity by society and distanced by classmates, she gradually began to hide her true face.</p>

<p>Her only solace was the words from her parents, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, the fear of the stares she had felt from those around her lingered to this day.</p>

<p>It was a university Senpai who also had an unusual hair color who broke through this barrier.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t there be a Japanese person with white hair? I mean, my hair is red, but I&rsquo;m still Japanese, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; that&rsquo;s true&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu made a close friend who accepted her without her facade, and eventually, she even revealed her true self to that friend&rsquo;s lover.</p>

<p>No one could have predicted it, and not even Kureha knew that Yuu was troubled by her hair color.</p>

<p>At least, to Takashi, whether Yuu wore a hood or not was of no consequence.</p>

<p>Naturally, he wouldn&rsquo;t mention it to her lover, Kureha.</p>

<p>The catalyst was a mere coincidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did someone say something bad to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-well&#8230; I&rsquo;ve been wearing a hoodie like this ever since I graduated high school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. That must have been tough. I&rsquo;m sorry for making you feel uncomfortable at the bar the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no&#8230;! I used to get comments like that at my previous job too, so I don&rsquo;t mind anymore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha&rsquo;s favorite bar happened to be where Yuu worked, and on that particular day, Yuu unexpectedly had to step in to cover the hall.</p>

<p>A series of coincidences revealed Yuu&rsquo;s complex and a path to resolution began to unfold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re not just numbing your feelings? It&rsquo;s not good to be dishonest with yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be honest, you say&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes, even if you&rsquo;re not aware of it yourself, a close friend can provide the trigger for self-awareness.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what the path to resolution is all about.</p>

<p>However, the resolution method was very much like Kureha&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be treated specially, right? Then, you should be honest with someone who is close to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you talking about yourself, Kureha Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? I&rsquo;m more likely to spoil you with special treatment~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, you mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I mean~. Don&rsquo;t worry. Since it might be embarrassing to be sober, why don&rsquo;t we start with a drink in the evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, a large number of canned Chuhai appeared from her bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet, bitter, or maybe sour! I&rsquo;ve brought a variety, so what will get you going, Yuu-chan?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about what will get me going! What&rsquo;s with all this alcohol?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? I thought I&rsquo;d have a drink with Yuu-chan, so I picked these up from the supermarket nearby before coming to your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have called me&#8230; Why would you carry all this by yourself&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it wouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise otherwise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more surprised by the fact that you carried all this by yourself than by the fact that you brought alcohol!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu couldn&rsquo;t hide her astonishment at the many cans of Chuhai laid out on the living room table.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just the sheer number of cans that surprised her, but Kureha&rsquo;s decisiveness in bringing them all to Yuu&rsquo;s room without hesitation.</p>

<p>Moreover, these weren&rsquo;t just ordinary cans of Chuhai; they were all tall cans.</p>

<p>Rich Peach Liquor, Asahi Super Dry, Frozen Lemon, and more&mdash;all of them large and long. No regular-sized cans of Chuhai emerged from Kureha&rsquo;s bag.</p>

<p>Kureha looked thoroughly pleased with Yuu&rsquo;s expression amidst this situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-well, it&rsquo;s not so bad. Times like these call for a drink, don&rsquo;t you think? Yuu-chan, you can drink, right? Takashi-kun said you were downing it at the yakiniku place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, well&#8230; I can drink, but it kind of feels like&#8230; I&rsquo;m being smoothly coerced into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm, do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go along with it. After all, you&rsquo;re probably just trying to expose my true self to Takashi and make fun of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you caught on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai and I think alike. It&rsquo;s fine, really, if it&rsquo;s with Takashi. I&rsquo;d rather have a drink first since it&rsquo;s too embarrassing to do it sober.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, of course, I understand~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing full well that Kureha&rsquo;s invitation was a trap, Yuu still picked up a bottle of alcohol from the table while muttering to herself, &ldquo;If I have to show my true face, I can&rsquo;t handle it without drinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Yuu, there was a crucial difference between revealing her true self to Kureha and to Takashi.</p>

<p>Of course, there were similarities. Kureha was somewhat shunned for her beauty and proportions, and Takashi was somewhat shunned for dating Kureha.</p>

<p>However, the nature of the estrangement was different.</p>

<p>Was it directed at her own person, or at his status?</p>

<p>And the comments Yuu had received about her true face had always been directed at her.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s why Yuu could show her complex-ridden true face in front of Kureha.</p>

<p>Most likely, it&rsquo;s because she trusts Takashi that she&rsquo;s willing to reveal her true face, &ldquo;just&rdquo; by letting herself go with the alcohol.</p>

<p>Kureha&rsquo;s face showed a look filled with affection, but it didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know, I&rsquo;m a little worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With those words, Kureha&rsquo;s expression shifted to one of teasing.</p>

<p>However, Yuu, who had already started drinking her Asahi Super Dry, didn&rsquo;t notice Kureha&rsquo;s expression.</p>

<p> She was also too busy munching on chocolate cookies she had taken out of her bag, thinking, &ldquo;What should I drink next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this distraction wouldn&rsquo;t last long either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you worried about?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, maybe about Takashi-kun&rsquo;s reaction?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine Takashi rejecting me after seeing my true face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if Takashi-kun falls for you, Yuu-chan&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu couldn&rsquo;t help but be shaken by the bombshell Kureha had dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe. How about that? Did it surprise you a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it did!!! What&rsquo;s with that impossible joke!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry-sorry. It&rsquo;s just that Yuu-chan doesn&rsquo;t seem to realize that she&rsquo;s cute, so I wanted to tease you a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, stop joking around like that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surprised and accidentally spitting out some beer, Yuu hurriedly wiped it off with a handkerchief while telling Kureha to stop teasing her.</p>

<p>Yuu, who wanted to be cute as a girl and had been working hard to be cute even without showing her true face, found Kureha&rsquo;s words bad for her heart as she still couldn&rsquo;t recognize her own cuteness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I&rsquo;m teasing you, but I&rsquo;m not lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Kureha said those words seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The anxiety that Takashi-kun might fall for you and the jealousy over your cuteness, both are real. They&rsquo;re not jokes at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Yuu, this was uncharted territory. And Kureha&rsquo;s expression, serious yet somewhat lonely, was also something unknown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! There&rsquo;s no way Takashi could fall for me now! Haven&rsquo;t you seen how he usually is!? He&rsquo;s totally smitten with you, Kureha Senpai!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not like he wouldn&rsquo;t be swayed by other girls, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Even so, it&rsquo;s impossible for me. We&rsquo;re just best friends, nothing more. He must feel the same. There&rsquo;s nothing for Kureha Senpai to worry about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Are you sure&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu couldn&rsquo;t hide her surprise at seeing Kureha so unusually downhearted.</p>

<p>Yet, with Yuu&rsquo;s repeated encouragement, Kureha regained her spirits and impulsively decided to send a love call to Takashi.</p>

<p>Now it was Yuu&rsquo;s turn to be flustered upon hearing Takashi&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you up to, Takashi-kun~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Well&#8230; I was just spacing out a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saying that, but in reality, you were eagerly waiting for a love call from me~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&#8230; uh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I hit the nail on the head, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>

<p> Video calling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an intimate time where you can talk while seeing the other person&rsquo;s expressions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a blissful moment where, even though you&rsquo;re physically apart, you can feel as if your lover is right there with you.</p>

<p>But the same goes for the other person. Any small fluctuation in your heart can be revealed through your facial expressions.</p>

<p>Looking away, getting a little flustered, or falling silent when faced with the truth.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s a happy time, it doesn&rsquo;t mean you can escape from the usual daily life.</p>

<p>However, even with video calls where a slight change in expression can give you away, it doesn&rsquo;t mean your innermost feelings are conveyed.</p>

<p> That is, if Kureha Senpai hadn&rsquo;t called me, I might have called her in just a little while&#8230; at least that&rsquo;s something I can be thankful for with video calling.</p>

<p>Otherwise, she would probably notice my restless demeanor not just from my face, but from my hands, my body language, or even from the tone of my voice.</p>

<p>My lover, Kureha Senpai, is that kind of person.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just teasing that makes it difficult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you eat properly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just cup noodles, was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a proper hamburger. Oh, and I cooked it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we lived together, she would worry about my sloppy eating habits and check on my dinner like this.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s another aspect that makes me fall for her all over again.</p>

<p>With her bright red hair fluttering softly, Senpai flashes a charming smile.</p>

<p> Ever since I started living with Senpai, my eating habits have completely changed, and now I feel uneasy if I don&rsquo;t have a proper meal.</p>

<p>As a human being, it&rsquo;s normal to have proper meals, but before living together, I prioritized pondering over Kureha Senpai much more than eating.</p>

<p>Even now, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t spend time brooding. However, I&rsquo;ve improved my lifestyle so as not to sadden Senpai.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt a bit of unease.</p>

<p>It was the redness in her cheeks. Clearly, it reminded me of how she looks when she&rsquo;s had alcohol, and I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling a twinge of worry.</p>

<p>To dispel that anxiety, I decided to ask casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, have you eaten, Kureha Senpai? I&rsquo;m worried you might be drinking too much and not eating&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mwahaha&#8230; no need to worry! Today, it&rsquo;s just this one can!! I&rsquo;ll be eating soon too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along with Senpai&rsquo;s words, what appeared on the screen was Senpai&rsquo;s favorite peach liquor.</p>

<p>My anxiety grew, but a part of me still wanted to believe everything was okay.</p>

<p>Suppressing those feelings, I tried to offer some supportive words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say it&rsquo;s just one can, but it&rsquo;s a tall one, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, if it&rsquo;s really just that one&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that&rsquo;s true. As her boyfriend, what exactly do you think you know about Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My best friend interjected with a sharp tone before I could continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this disaster!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could reply, Yuu must have snatched the smartphone from Kureha Senpai because the screen shook violently.</p>

<p> In the meantime, I could hear my girlfriend and best friend causing a ruckus on the other end of the call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, wait&#8230; what are you doing, Yuu-chan!!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resign yourself! This is your punishment for all the teasing you&rsquo;ve done to me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your fault for being so cute, Yuu-chan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were on good terms or not as they bickered without seeming too angry.</p>

<p>Amidst this, I was shown a sight that made me stunned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Senpai, isn&rsquo;t this a bit too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-it can&rsquo;t be helped. I didn&rsquo;t know how much Yuu-chan would drink&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you had such a smug look on your face when you pulled it out of your bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuu-chan&#8230; shh!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene presented to me over the screen was a row of tall cans, clearly more than what two people would normally drink, and Kureha Senpai had brought them all by herself.</p>

<p>The excitement I felt when Senpai first called me had now vanished, replaced by a sense of obligation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we keep the call going until we start eating? That&rsquo;s okay, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could it be that Senpai&rsquo;s eating habits are lax when I&rsquo;m not around?</p>

<p>Frustration towards others builds up unnoticed and must be vented before it explodes. This varies from person to person, in both capacity and triggers.</p>

<p>But inevitably, frustration accumulates towards others, including towards a significant other, as I realized today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Senpai. Show me how you cook. Let&rsquo;s see the cool side of Senpai when she&rsquo;s had a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230; you&rsquo;re hitting where it hurts&#8230; I thought I could just get by with drinks and snacks&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all the effort to regulate your diet, you&rsquo;re going to let yourself go? What happened to the Senpai from this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you have to eat properly in the morning, right!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have to eat properly at night too.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s satisfying to be able to vent my usual frustrations by teasing my girlfriend in return.</p>

<p>Teasing Senpai over the video call, I get to see her become a little downcast, flustered, or surprised when I hit the mark&mdash;expressions of Senpai I don&rsquo;t usually get to see.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one complaint, it&rsquo;s that I can&rsquo;t record this scene. Since it&rsquo;s a video call, this moment is fleeting, visible only now.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the only dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>If possible, I&rsquo;d like to tease Senpai face-to-face, but that&rsquo;s probably a wish that won&rsquo;t come true.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I thought we should make the most of this moment. But then&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, haven&rsquo;t you forgotten about me? Well, I guess it&rsquo;s fine. You can flirt with each other like you always do. But, Senpai, remember that this is my room and Takashi, I also haven&rsquo;t eaten yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My best friend, who had just shown me her bare face barged in while clearly irritated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither Kureha Senpai nor I could find any fault with Yuu&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>Instead, we were suddenly overwhelmed with guilt and apologized in unison to the silver-haired beauty.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine as long as you understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Removing her hood and revealing her silver hair, Yuu remained her usual self, even over the video call.</p>

<p>Each gesture she made was somehow reassuring.</p>

<p>Ah&#8230; it&rsquo;s the same old best friend, I thought.</p>

<p>And the next words she said were also typical of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, I have a question for Takashi, who seems to be enjoying his revenge on his girlfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please stop phrasing it like that. It&rsquo;s not wrong, but just&#8230; please don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Caught off guard by her words, I suddenly switched to polite speech.</p>

<p>Unperturbed, my silver-haired friend smiled at me through the video call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I do? Should I entice Kureha-san to cook, or should I make the food and feed Kureha-san?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen my friend&rsquo;s mischievous face in detail before, usually hidden under her hood.</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes, giving me a sharp look as if she had spotted her prey.</p>

<p>She even put her index finger to the corner of her small lips, adding a touch of mischievousness.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t foolish enough to miss the true intention behind Yuu&rsquo;s words despite the act.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like Yuu-chan to cook for me~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, please be quiet for a moment. I need to think seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muu&#8230; When you look at me with such serious eyes, it makes my heart race&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re saying is that you&rsquo;re consulting your desires, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai melted with a look of ecstasy, while Yuu wore an expression of exasperation as I ignored my girlfriend&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p> In the midst of this, I pondered deeply.</p>

<p>Should I let the drunken Kureha Senpai cook, or should I have the still-composed Yuu make the meal?</p>

<p>Should I continue my revenge on Senpai, or should I go along with Yuu&rsquo;s rhythm?</p>

<p>I was torn with indecision.</p>

<p>Amidst my contemplation, I was further troubled by the friendly exchanges between Kureha Senpai and Yuu, such as</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nngh&#8230; smells good&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey&#8230; stop it with the alcohol smell!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s peach liquor, it&rsquo;s not that strong&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After much deliberation, I reached a conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, Yuu. Please get Kureha Senpai to head to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright. So Takashi wants to see the useless Kureha Senpai, huh? You have peculiar tastes~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of it, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;? What else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also want to see how flustered you get, Yuu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a decision to observe both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be looking at your girlfriend, not me!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little did I know that Yuu would be furious with me afterward.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; the smell of bonito flakes is so nice. It kind of makes me want to strip. Can I take off my clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, please keep your clothes on. Otherwise, the pervert on the other side of the screen will see everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Mmm, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being seen, though~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both members of the couple were perverts, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p> I was misled by Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s wild claims.</p>

<p>Moreover, through Yuu&rsquo;s anxious voice on the phone, it became clear that those words were quite serious for Senpai.</p>

<p>As if to add to that, the phrase &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being seen&rdquo; came up.</p>

<p>My judgment, already skewed by living with Senpai, conjured up the image of Kureha Senpai slowly undressing in my mind.</p>

<p>With a gentle release of her clothes, the laid-back Kureha Senpai smiled slyly, imagining me blushing in embarrassment, becoming bolder&mdash;</p>

<p>Even in front of Yuu, she doesn&rsquo;t stop teasing me&mdash;</p>

<p>My head is completely filled with my beloved Senpai. I&rsquo;m totally immersed in thoughts of Kureha.</p>

<p>Of course, I can&rsquo;t let Yuu realize that, so I have to bluff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m not a pervert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even though you leaned your face so close to the screen when Senpai was about to strip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;You saw that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried to bait you, but you really did lean in. That&rsquo;s seriously off-putting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just like that, it was embarrassingly confirmed that I was a pervert.</p>

<p>Yuu&rsquo;s gaze felt cold.</p>

<p>What I had previously sensed only through words and behavior, I now felt through her gaze and expression, so the destructive power was immense.</p>

<p>But Kureha Senpai, unconcerned with my feelings, continued to act in her own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what have you been doing all this time, Senpai? You&rsquo;ve been rustling around behind me for a while now.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh, I&rsquo;m just wearing a naked apron?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naked apron&#8230;?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thud&#8230;!</p>

<p>I involuntarily leaned forward and shake the table vigorously.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how shocking the words Kureha Senpai uttered were.</p>

<p>Rather than being shocking&mdash;it was as if the fantasy I had been restraining before was now accelerating.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s probably smirking with satisfaction right now, grinning at the thought of teasing me.</p>

<p>A single piece of cloth draped over her chest to protect it from oil splatters?</p>

<p>Naturally, since she mentioned a naked apron, her back would be completely defenseless. The image of her white back spread through my mind.</p>

<p> Even though there&rsquo;s no point in doing this, I imagine poking Senpai&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>As I remember the soft sensation, I hear Senpai&rsquo;s seductive voice in my head,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hyah&#8230;! Uuh&#8230;nn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The image of Senpai&rsquo;s face when she&rsquo;s naked crosses my mind, and I find myself wanting to hear more of Senpai&rsquo;s seductive voice.</p>

<p>What would be next after her back?</p>

<p>Her nape? Her chest? Or perhaps something that I had just glimpsed through her jeans this morning.</p>

<p>Just as I&rsquo;m about to reach out towards my lover&rsquo;s trembling bottom, which seems like it would crush if touched&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, you pervert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m snapped back to reality by the stern voice of my best friend, Yuu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a pervert!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m not angry about being brought back to reality.</p>

<p>In fact, I almost want to thank her for it. But that&rsquo;s a separate issue.</p>

<p>I am definitely not a pervert.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your expression gives it all away, pervert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as I deny it, Yuu calls me a pervert again with a sharp look in her eyes.</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s something else that&rsquo;s bothering me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gives it all away&#8230; what does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s as if Yuu can see right through me, knowing exactly what I was thinking.</p>

<p>Naturally, I&rsquo;m dying to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? You were obviously imagining Senpai in a naughty pose, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p> It seemed that Yuu had seen right through me.</p>

<p>She had called me a pervert, fully aware of it, without knowing how much I struggle on a daily basis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Yuu. What happened earlier was beyond my control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh really? I&rsquo;m not expecting much, but do go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be my first time seeing Kureha Senpai in a naked apron. So naturally, I was curious about it? And this morning, she was naked and started attacking me while I was sleeping&mdash;it was quite the ordeal, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How lively you two are&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all Senpai&rsquo;s doing. She&rsquo;s the one who went out of control&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strange.</p>

<p>I was only trying to explain myself, but Yuu&rsquo;s gaze was becoming even more severe. I might be mistaken for a monkey.</p>

<p>I needed to explain myself better&#8230; but before I could think further&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, you were all excited, weren&rsquo;t you~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai dropped a bombshell, one that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly defend against.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You two&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&#8230; wait!? How does Senpai even know about that!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I just had a feeling~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you had a feeling, you don&rsquo;t have to say it out loud!! Do you see how Yuu is looking at me right now?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, get your face away from the screen! How long are you going to keep showing me that perverted face?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; sorry&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was only trying to explain myself.</p>

<p>Moreover, I just wanted to see Senpai cooking over a video call.</p>

<p>Why is it that even though we&rsquo;re apart, I always end up being tossed around by Senpai&#8230;</p>

<p>Yet, as I think about it, instead of disliking Senpai, I find myself thinking about her more and more. It must be because I&rsquo;m too far gone in love with Senpai&mdash;Kureha.</p>

<p>As I snapped back from my daydream, the two words that Senpai once uttered came to mind.</p>

<p>Even though they should still be far off in the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muu&#8230; I took it off to make Takashi-kun happy&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then at least do it in your own house. Have some consideration for me who has to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu scolded her, and Kureha Senpai, while complaining, started to put her clothes back on.</p>

<p>I could only confirm this through the call, but it was easy to imagine Senpai pouting with her cheeks puffed out.</p>

<p>Her sulky, glaring eyes like a puffed-up blowfish.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the influence of my earlier fantasy that led me to such unnecessary imaginings.</p>

<p> &ldquo;And you, the pervert, don&rsquo;t make such a disappointed face. You&rsquo;re not a pervert, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you please stop calling me a pervert!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t make a face that looks like a pervert. Why are you disappointed when she&rsquo;s getting dressed? You should be relieved, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because I was aware of it, I couldn&rsquo;t say anything back to Yuu&rsquo;s spot-on remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like Takashi-kun even when he&rsquo;s being a pervert~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, please be quiet for a bit. It&rsquo;s complicating things, and frankly, your lovey-dovey talk is annoying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s attempt to back me up was futile, swept away by Yuu&rsquo;s irritation. Or rather, was it my imagination that Senpai&rsquo;s words only increased Yuu&rsquo;s annoyance?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s just my imagination. Before I started dating Senpai, every time someone gushed about their love life, I found it sweet but also felt a tinge of jealousy.</p>

<p>Yuu must be feeling something similar right now.</p>

<p>Of course, even when dealing with Senpai, there are times when I want to dismiss it all as &ldquo;annoying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Senpai herself doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind being brushed off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just continue with the cooking, will you? We&rsquo;ve only got the miso soup ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry so much~. I found just the thing in the fridge~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as long as it&rsquo;s fine with you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s always so laid-back. Rummaging through someone else&rsquo;s fridge without any hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried&#8230; not just about the cooking, but I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that she&rsquo;s going to slip up in some other way&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite how much I trust Yuu, seeing Senpai&rsquo;s overly relaxed expression through the camera fills me with anxiety.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m even worried she might start a fire.</p>

<p>However, reality is different from my fears.</p>

<p> Far from causing a fire, there&rsquo;s no screaming, no clumsy Senpai cutting her finger and whimpering, &ldquo;Oww&#8230; it hurts&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the phone, I see the serious side of my lover, which I usually only glimpse from behind.</p>

<p>Every time I see it, my heart flutters uncontrollably. It&rsquo;s a side of her I&rsquo;m not used to.</p>

<p>Today, my heart is fluttering even more than usual.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not just the alcohol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite skilled, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my mom made sure to teach me properly back at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, that explains it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chop, chop, rhythmically cutting the daikon into large pieces.</p>

<p>The peeled skin is quickly soaked in water, and the daikon itself goes into the pot.</p>

<p>Thanks to Yuu&rsquo;s thoughtful arrangement, I can see every move Senpai makes.</p>

<p>Her skill is not just that of an amateur, it&rsquo;s like watching a professional chef at work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s almost like being shown a documentary about a cook.</p>

<p>But still, those hands belong to Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day! every day! thinking of Takashi-kun makes time fly by~&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she says this, the familiar rhythm of her knife is comforting to my ears.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the sound that greets me first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>The sound that accompanies Senpai&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good morning~&rdquo; as I open the door to find her waiting.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a sound that has become essential to my life, one that would make me feel strange without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> Before I know it, I&rsquo;m calling out to my beloved.</p>

<p>Without any particular reason, just wanting to call out to her. My feelings just keep swelling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day would be filled with happiness if I married Kureha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once I start to realize this, I can&rsquo;t stop, and I blurt out something outrageous.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10</strong></p>

<p>Marriage.</p>

<p>I knew full well what that word meant now that I was a university student. That&rsquo;s why I should have been careful when speaking about it.</p>

<p>I should have been careful, but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every day would be filled with happiness if I married Kureha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I know it, my feelings have gotten ahead of me, and the words slip out.</p>

<p>Of course, the call is still ongoing. And it&rsquo;s a video call, no less.</p>

<p>I can see every expression on the other side.</p>

<p> That includes Yuu&rsquo;s &ldquo;What are you talking about now?&rdquo; look, and behind her, Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s blushing face&#8230;</p>

<p>Wait, blushing&#8230;??</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m taken aback by Senpai&rsquo;s unexpected reaction, and her words are just as surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, Takashi-kun&#8230;? What&rsquo;s with the sudden marriage talk&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, seriously, why are you like this? When we talked about moving in together, you were all excited, saying, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just get married?&rsquo; weren&rsquo;t you, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just&#8230; you know, going with the flow&#8230; I mean, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to get married, but it was more about lightening the mood&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of what Senpai said back then, I&rsquo;ve become serious about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can you believe it?</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s usually composed voice is now filled with unmistakable agitation.</p>

<p>Her voice, usually teasing with a grin, is now trembling through the speaker, filling the room.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the voice of my adorable lover, sounding like a whining child on the verge of tears.</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve heard Senpai&rsquo;s flustered voice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Senpai get flustered and retaliate many times, only to be defeated each time.</p>

<p>However, this time the agitation is different.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no sign of a counterattack; it&rsquo;s as if Senpai had completely accepted defeat&mdash;just like when I gave up after being continuously mocked by Senpai.</p>

<p>Could it be that&#8230;?</p>

<p>Strangely, my heart is racing. I feel even more nervous than when I blurted out &ldquo;marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought about deepening my relationship with Kureha Senpai, especially when I see Senpai playing with someone else, even if that person is Yuu.</p>

<p>I like Senpai. So much that I could blurt out &ldquo;marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, let&rsquo;s get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I decided to consciously convey my feelings to Senpai this time.</p>

<p>Surely, my feelings must be reaching Senpai.</p>

<p>Otherwise, this situation wouldn&rsquo;t have happened. Just like this&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahhh&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow. Your hands were moving so smoothly just a moment ago, and now they&rsquo;re shaking so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-it can&rsquo;t be helped&#8230;! It&rsquo;s because Takashi-kun is just too cool&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, the daikon that was being cut so beautifully is now completely shredded.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s going to be cooked later anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re calm about that, I see&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahhh!!? I mixed up the sugar and salt!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even making a classic mistake&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay! I only added a little, so it shouldn&rsquo;t make much of a difference&#8230;! Besides, all that&rsquo;s left is to add the main fish and simmer it gently like this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, that&rsquo;s high heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uuu&#8230;!!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a bit hard to listen to.</p>

<p>I was hoping for the adorable clumsiness of Senpai, but I never imagined it would go to the level of mixing up seasonings and misjudging the heat.</p>

<p>I do love such a klutzy Senpai, though.</p>

<p>But even so, there&rsquo;s a limit to klutziness. I feel like I might ruin Senpai if I keep doing this.</p>

<p>Of course, I have no intention of giving Senpai to anyone else, and my love for Senpai&rsquo;s klutziness hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>It hasn&rsquo;t changed, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling that this can&rsquo;t go on. That&rsquo;s what I was thinking, and my words were already decided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Senpai&#8230; You don&rsquo;t have to answer right now&#8230; Whenever you feel like responding is fine&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Postponing the response.</p>

<p>Maybe Senpai is flustered because she thinks she needs to answer right away. Even if that&rsquo;s not the case, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>Either way, I felt that Senpai and I needed to take a step back.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I felt we might both end up ruined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Is that okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. A confession&rsquo;s response isn&rsquo;t something you should rush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing my words, Senpai seemed relieved.</p>

<p>Her voice regained its composure, still slightly high-pitched but much better than when she was making blunders.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel relieved at Senpai&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>But still, I had reached my limit.</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m sorry. Can we end the call now? If I keep watching Senpai, I might say something strange again&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai is so dear to me, and I feel like I might make her do something odd again.</p>

<p>Wanting to avoid that, I decided to end our fun time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-is that so? Then it can&rsquo;t be helped&#8230;! For some reason, I&rsquo;m sorry!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai, in her own way, seems to have something on her mind, her voice rising again as she agrees to end the call.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, good night. And sorry, Yuu, for dragging you into this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, see you again tomorrow, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before long, the three-way call between me, Senpai, and Yuu came to an end.</p>

<p>It was a long, blissful time that left me with complex feelings.</p>
