<h2>Chapter 6: As Much as Senpai Desires</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Some time had passed since the incident involving Senpai and the bath.</p>

<p>During one lunch break, the faint heat on my nape still lingered, and my feelings became even more unsettled every time I saw Senpai.</p>

<p>Senpai, for her part, had stopped teasing me as persistently as before.</p>

<p>Instead, something else had changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Yuu-chan, say &lsquo;ahh&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-ahh&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it? The limited-time marron parfait. Tasty?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;W-well&#8230; it&rsquo;s delicious, but&#8230; are you sure it&rsquo;s okay, Kureha-san? You came all the way down to the lower campus cafeteria, and Takashi-kun next to you looks incredibly jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I like Takashi-kun even when he&rsquo;s like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that so? If Senpai says it&rsquo;s fine, then I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, you should worry! I&rsquo;m the one who paid for that giant marron parfait, you know!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, my girlfriend Kureha Senpai and my best friend Yuu were flirting right in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>Moreover, neither of them seemed to find anything odd about this situation, which was utterly baffling to me.</p>

<p>My wallet was empty, save for a receipt showing the 3,000 yen I had spent on the parfait.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Senpai had taken the trouble to come down to the area where Yuu and I were, I felt pathetic for not usually carrying that much cash around&#8230;</p>

<p>Our university, Shirakumo University, was broadly divided into three areas.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Cultural Area&rsquo; where club buildings were clustered, and, separated by a large hill within the campus, the &lsquo;Upper Campus Area&rsquo; where the humanities faculties were mainly active, and the &lsquo;Lower Campus Area&rsquo; for the science faculties.</p>

<p>The university might have official names for these areas, but at least among the students, such names have become the norm.</p>

<p>So it was a rare occurrence for humanities students like Kureha Senpai in the Lower Campus Area.</p>

<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I asked Kureha-san, &lsquo;are you sure it&rsquo;s okay, Kureha-san?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you gave up right away after hearing Senpai&rsquo;s words! And Senpai, why are you having lunch with Yuu and me anyway!? I was a little hopeful when Senpai called me out&#8230;!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now-now, it&rsquo;s fine. I just wanted to have a little chat with Yuu-chan today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Contrary to my confusion over the unexpected turn of events, my best friend and girlfriend were very casual about it.</p>

<p>Yuu acts as if it were someone else&rsquo;s problem, and Kureha Senpai lets a slight smile slip upon seeing my annoyed expression.</p>

<p>Troublesome enough on their own, the two of them together were naturally a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to talk with Yuu alone, wasn&rsquo;t there no point in calling me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trying to escape the situation, I attempted to leave the scene by being a little blunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuu-chan suggested that maybe Takashi-kun could treat us to lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We planned to leech you off from the start, I guess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a mischievous smile from my girlfriend and a guiltless, soothing voice from my best friend, I was easily defeated.</p>

<p>Unable to stand up to or escape from the perfectly in-sync pair, I decided to suppress the urge to get up and leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;by the way, was there ever an occasion that made you two get along so well that you&rsquo;d even contact each other without me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While calming myself, I asked what had triggered their close relationship, but perhaps that was a mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm? It was when we exchanged contacts at the bar. Of course, we&rsquo;d get along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t realize?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I was too drunk at the time&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitiful. What do you think of having such a boyfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s very cute. In fact, I was thinking of getting him completely drunk and devouring him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As expected, you&rsquo;re quite something. I asked the owner about it, and I heard that you can drink strong cocktails at a high pace without getting drunk at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t show on the outside, but my thoughts are worse when I&rsquo;m drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My best friend teased me for my low tolerance to alcohol, and Senpai, as always, mocked me in her usual manner.</p>

<p>Moreover, Senpai&rsquo;s teasing went beyond mere jest to a declaration of &ldquo;devouring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Combined with the incident in the bath the other day, Senpai&rsquo;s declaration felt all too real, sending shivers down my spine.</p>

<p>However, these goosebumps were not unpleasant; rather, they might be akin to a warrior&rsquo;s trembling from the desire to make it a reality.</p>

<p>After all, my heart was racing uncontrollably just from Senpai&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>Of course, Senpai was well aware of how I was feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dislike me being like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I dislike it, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I just say I like you instead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you if you give me lots of kisses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I looked at Senpai after feeling a tug at the hem of my clothes, there was my lover gazing at me with a blissful expression.</p>

<p>The words that came out were simple, straightforward words that came out because of love.</p>

<p>The crimson goddess who seeks kisses. Are kisses really enough?</p>

<p>Just like the time Senpai kissed my neck, showing me her feverish breath.</p>

<p>The sweet atmosphere was slowly enveloping us&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, if you&rsquo;re going to flirt right in front of me, my parfait is going to taste too sweet, so please spare me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sorry&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, we got scolded.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I wonder how long it would have continued if it hadn&rsquo;t unfolded in front of Yuu&#8230;</p>

<p>With that thought, I put my now-empty wallet into my left pocket and left the lower campus cafeteria.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Walking. Just walking, as if running away from something.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no escaping that something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what did Senpai really want to do? There&rsquo;s definitely something, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While avoiding Yuu&rsquo;s chilly gaze, I asked Kureha Senpai for an explanation.</p>

<p>Senpai may often be short on words, but there&rsquo;s always some kind of principle behind her actions.</p>

<p>For example, wanting to tease, wanting to be lovey-dovey, wanting to punish&#8230;</p>

<p>There must be some kind of motive this time too, something that doesn&rsquo;t fit into any of those categories.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but think so while looking at Senpai who looked somewhat apologetic while grinning.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, well, I was reflecting on maybe having gone a bit too far last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bath incident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wish she would at least think before she speaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bath? Wait, are you saying you&rsquo;ve progressed that far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, a stern voice came from my best friend walking beside me.</p>

<p> Glancing sideways, I was met with an even colder gaze.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s not like that, okay!? I was just attacked by a slightly drunk Senpai, and I couldn&rsquo;t help it, that&rsquo;s all!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you admit that you took a bath together, you pervert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s just unreasonable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurriedly tried to explain the situation to Yuu, but it only made things worse.</p>

<p>Why is this happening&#8230; I was just telling the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, what a pervert~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose fault do you think this is, huh? Whose fault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My girlfriend, the cause of me being called a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; by Yuu, is giggling away. Even though her cheeks are flushed, there&rsquo;s a sense of apology there, so I can&rsquo;t bring myself to be angry too much.</p>

<p>If anyone should be angry, it&rsquo;s not me but Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault for letting Yuu-chan into your room without my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s your bad. Even if it was for the sake of hiding your erotic mags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although I don&rsquo;t have romantic feelings for Yuu, I admit it was insensitive of me. No matter the reason for hiding the erotic magazines, I should have found a better way and I&rsquo;m reflecting on that.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Senpai isn&rsquo;t angry about the erotic magazines and even allows me to have them. Of course, not all erotic magazines are permitted, but they&rsquo;re still important for maintaining a healthy cohabitation with Senpai.</p>

<p>Well, letting Yuu into my room wasn&rsquo;t something that could be brushed off with a simple &ldquo;I see&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, I recreated the bath scene from those erotic magazines for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the looks of it, did this guy react satisfactorily to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was so cute~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cute, huh. Lucky you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m happy being called cute? Senpai, please don&rsquo;t say unnecessary things! It&rsquo;ll just encourage Yuu!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh~, but it&rsquo;s true~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just Senpai&rsquo;s delusion! I&rsquo;m a man!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s okay for boys to be cute too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if you say that with such a serious face&#8230; I&rsquo;m not trying to be cute..&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that really the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I truly want to be manly. I can tell by your face, Yuu, that you&rsquo;re thinking something weird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tsk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faced with their relentless teasing&mdash;one for letting a female friend into my room and the other for joining in on teasing her best friend&mdash;I&rsquo;m desperately trying to hold my ground as Yuu clicks her tongue in annoyance.</p>

<p>Senpai, on the other hand, looks amused and is grinning.</p>

<p>For my part, seeing Senpai laughing so happily makes me feel a bit more honest with my feelings.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Rather, Senpai, you should be aware of how cute you are yourself. If you suddenly do something like you did the other day, my heart won&rsquo;t be able to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other day? When exactly? I&rsquo;ve tempted Takashi-kun so much. I don&rsquo;t remember when.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;&#8230;It was during the bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bath&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What comes to mind is the scene from that day. The reflection in the mirror of the bathroom when something soft was pressed against my back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The kiss on the nape of my neck, close to my back&#8230; I couldn&rsquo;t move for a while after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment after feeling the warm breath on the nape of my neck the softness that followed, Senpai&rsquo;s expression melted away.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a moment I can never forget, nor am I supposed to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a shallow love that would allow me to forget such an adorable aspect of Senpai.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai says nothing.</p>

<p>No, without uttering a coherent word, she just blushes and stammers, &ldquo;O-Oh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing Senpai like this, Yuu corners her with a sly grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Huh, so Senpai did something like that, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back kisses&rdquo; and &ldquo;neck kisses.&rdquo; Yuu seems to know what these gestures mean, easily cornering Kureha Senpai, who had shown a maidenly side.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what those actions mean, though.</p>

<p>And so, Senpai and I, having arrived at the university gates, bid farewell to Yuu as she headed toward the station, and we returned to our rooms.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230; to think that the day would come when Takashi-kun would get one over on me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no intention of doing that&#8230; If anything, I just wanted Senpai to realize how cute she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realize that&rsquo;s exactly what trying to get one over on someone means?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah. It seems like I didn&rsquo;t realize it. I knew that, but I also like that about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night after lunch with Yuu, with my wallet completely empty, I find myself being scolded by Senpai for reasons I can&rsquo;t quite grasp.</p>

<p>I just called cute Senpai cute, but what could she possibly be dissatisfied with?</p>

<p>If anyone should be dissatisfied, it should be me.</p>

<p>Even if she teases me, I wish she&rsquo;d realize that her teasing expressions and gestures are what stir my feelings so much.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s sly smile, Kureha Senpai blushing slightly, my lover showing a hint of embarrassment &ndash; my heart can&rsquo;t stop racing. That hasn&rsquo;t changed even now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what time is it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, it&rsquo;s time for me to be spoiled by Takashi-kun, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But still, there are other ways to be spoiled. Why do you have to sit on my lap to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why is Senpai sitting on my lap instead of her usual spot on the sofa?</p>

<p>Why, upon returning from university, do we immediately switch to cuddle time instead of preparing dinner?</p>

<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t I refuse Senpai&rsquo;s invitation?</p>

<p>There are so many questions.</p>

<p>The person in question, with unwavering confidence, turns her face to me and declares,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because last time I was spoiled, it was on your back. This time I want to be spoiled facing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I understand what Kureha Senpai means.</p>

<p> I too want to be spoiled by her face-to-face, without any teasing, with genuine feelings. But maybe it&rsquo;s too soon for that, as I might avert my eyes even more than usual from such genuine affection from Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>This situation is not good for me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So why are you sitting facing away from me? It&rsquo;s kind of&#8230; you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it bother you that my butt is touching you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you please move away for a bit if you know it does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it okay to move away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if, hypothetically, you were conscious of my butt and I were to check on that, I wonder what exactly would happen to you~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s okay with you, I&rsquo;m going to move away? I&rsquo;ll find out if Takashi-kun is a pervert who gets excited by my butt~&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am completely at the mercy of Senpai&rsquo;s whims.</p>

<p>And despite my best efforts to ignore it, the softness of Senpai&rsquo;s body becomes unavoidably apparent as she presses against me more insistently.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not the softness of her chest, but a different kind of softness.</p>

<p>Even through Senpai&rsquo;s jeans and my pants, I can feel the two hills.</p>

<p>The sensation of being squeezed between Senpai&rsquo;s soft hills, and if I look down just a bit, there&rsquo;s my lover, her face slightly flushed with excitement even as she smiles playfully.</p>

<p>The sensations become even sharper.</p>

<p>What kind of face am I supposed to make at Senpai if she catches me in this state?</p>

<p>No, more importantly, will I be able to watch Senpai&rsquo;s back as she cooks breakfast in the morning with a fond smile on my face?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t be able to. The moment Senpai catches me and teases me, I&rsquo;ll remember it forever and won&rsquo;t be able to look at her the same way again.</p>

<p>In that case, my response to Senpai is clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, should I move away? Or is it okay to stay like this and be spoiled?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? I can&rsquo;t hear you~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine like this!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehehe, that&rsquo;s more like it~&rdquo;</p>

<p>I just need to calm down the sharp sensations before Senpai sees.</p>

<p>Well&#8230; the fact that I don&rsquo;t want Senpai to notice is practically the same as her already know, but at that time, I was oblivious to such things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let Takashi-kun get one over on me all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was also unaware of Senpai&rsquo;s quiet determination.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, shall we toast soon? It&rsquo;s a good thing I picked up some drinks and snacks at the supermarket. Now Takashi-kun can drink without having to show me anything important~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you buy the drinks at the supermarket anticipating this? I thought it was strange. You said we were out even though there&rsquo;s still unopened alcohol in the kitchen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you went through the checkout so smoothly. Weren&rsquo;t you actually looking forward to this~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really now~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai, who doesn&rsquo;t want to move an inch from my lap, places the pre-purchased evening drink set on the table and turns a mischievous smile towards me.</p>

<p>Her expression seems to say, &ldquo;You got away without having to show me anything important~&rdquo; and it makes me even less willing to have her stand up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m even more acutely aware of Senpai&rsquo;s soft twin hills than before.</p>

<p>Besides, I enjoy drinking with Senpai like this, messing around.</p>

<p>I wanted to see Senpai enjoy some luxurious food during the day, which is a secret from her, but I never imagined it would come true in the form of &ldquo;Senpai sitting on my lap, snuggling up to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t dislike this situation. I don&rsquo;t dislike it, but on the other side, being played with by Senpai all the time has been bothering me lately.</p>

<p>Will Senpai continue to tease me like this if I just keep getting embarrassed?</p>

<p>Will Senpai keep smiling happily at me if I just keep blushing?</p>

<p>Will Senpai keep her affection for me if I can&rsquo;t make any moves towards her?</p>

<p>As I felt uncertain about my future relationship with Senpai, she finished preparing the drinks.</p>

<p>The cuteness of Senpai tapping on my knee and signalling &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ready~&rdquo; vanishes my earlier anxieties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what shall we drink first? I bought a lot this time too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start with something sweet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I thought you&rsquo;d say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before me, an array of various canned chuhai.</p>

<p>Among the fruity canned chuhai that reminds me of Senpai&rsquo;s favorite canned juice, Mister Pepper, I pick up the &ldquo;Luxurious Strawberry Flavor&rdquo; that Senpai is eyeing with a particularly intense gaze and hand it over to Senpai.</p>

<p>With a snicker, I expect Senpai to take the preferred canned chuhai, but Senpai&rsquo;s hand doesn&rsquo;t move toward the can.</p>

<p>Instead, Senpai places a hand on my arm, which is holding the can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let out a voice tinged with uncertainty, unable to discern what my lover was thinking.</p>

<p>However, the feeling from my arm suggests that Senpai&rsquo;s mood is far from anxious, and rather filled with anticipation.</p>

<p>And then, Senpai verbalizes it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;m going to be spoiled by you today. Are you such a fool that you don&rsquo;t understand what that means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; I see what you mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other words, Senpai is asking to be thoroughly pampered.</p>

<p>I sigh lightly as I pull the tab to open the strawberry-flavored canned chuhai.</p>

<p> The sigh isn&rsquo;t for Senpai. It&rsquo;s for myself, for I still do not fully understand Senpai.</p>

<p>Although we haven&rsquo;t been living together for very long, we&rsquo;ve been dating for over a year.</p>

<p>Yet, I still can&rsquo;t anticipate what my lover might be thinking.</p>

<p>But now is not the time for that. What&rsquo;s important is to create the &ldquo;sweet time&rdquo; that Senpai desires, and I, too, want to spend a sweet time with Senpai.</p>

<p>With that thought, I bring the freshly opened strawberry-flavored canned chuhai close to Senpai&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>As I move my arm, I feel a slight tickle from Senpai&rsquo;s fingers brushing against it&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Now, let me drink from it~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll let you drink&#8230; wait, you mean let you drink like this!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right~? I&rsquo;m enjoying being in Takashi-kun&rsquo;s arms like this~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I become a convenient chair now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much to have you exclusively?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seriously try to buy me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, Senpai seems quite serious about wanting to be spoiled.</p>

<p>Before I know it, Kureha Senpai has snugly nestled into my arms and is rubbing against my chest.</p>

<p>And Senpai seems to be quite pleased, looking at me with moist, pleading eyes as if trying to purchase me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m genuinely relieved that I haven&rsquo;t started drinking yet.</p>

<p>Honestly, when I&rsquo;m drinking, I tend to make decisions that are too honest with my feelings.</p>

<p>I might just say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything. As much as Senpai desires&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, let me drink quickly~? Come on~ hurry~ up~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-okay! Just make sure you don&rsquo;t spill it, alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I spill, will you take a bath with me again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take a bath with you! Take one by yourself!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tsk~. I was thinking of spilling a little on purpose, but maybe I won&rsquo;t~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a waste of good alcohol, so you better not&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Let&rsquo;s save the shared shower for another time.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;You just can&rsquo;t give up on showers, can you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unaware of my feelings, Senpai always tempts me with her sweetness, no, more than usual.</p>

<p>I can feel the softness of Kureha Senpai with my entire body.</p>

<p>With such sweet temptation, it might be impossible to endure without extraordinary patience.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; Mmm&#8230; Phew&#8230; Delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s good to hear&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm~? What&rsquo;s wrong~, you&rsquo;re fidgeting so much~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fidgeting at all!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be shy~. It&rsquo;s okay to hug me tight like this, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I won&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no way I could easily embrace Senpai myself. I&rsquo;m already flustered with Senpai fitting perfectly in my arms, and if I were to pull her closer, the sensitivity of my vulnerable spots might become even more pronounced.</p>

<p>Senpai, oblivious to my turmoil, sips her strawberry Chuhai with relish.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m the one holding the can, and Senpai just pulls my arm to her mouth whenever she wants a drink.</p>

<p>She could drink normally without any stress, but Senpai doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind.</p>

<p>Rather, she seems to find bliss in the time spent nestled between my arms and knees, which I can sense even from behind.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, who weakly protests not being hugged, swings her side-tail while complaining, &ldquo;Eh~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Occasionally, the side-tail brushes against me, filling my nose with the scent of the shampoo Senpai always uses.</p>

<p>A sweet yet sexy rose fragrance. And then, I can&rsquo;t help but recall the soft sensation pressed against my back.</p>

<p>I know I shouldn&rsquo;t remember, but I inadvertently recall the time we showered together.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t forget, even if I want to, Senpai&rsquo;s echoing voice, the temperature of the bath at that time, and the scent of the shampoo. Not to mention the soft touch on my back and nape.</p>

<p>I wonder about the meaning behind Senpai&rsquo;s last kiss, but I try not to think too deeply about it.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more the urge that surged through me when she kissed my back seems to attack again&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, please feed me some snacks next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s not just alcohol, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course~? Didn&rsquo;t I say? Today I&rsquo;m going to be totally spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;You did say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, with that said, could you give me an &lsquo;ahh&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Senpai requested, I picked up her favorite sweet snack, a sweet and salty chocolate-coated bean snack called &ldquo;Chorippy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a popular treat, both as a snack and as a side dish to drinks.</p>

<p>I pour a few Chorippy into my palm and hold them out in front of Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p> &ldquo;&#8230;Is this okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m being fed.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Senpai is the one making it happen&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a little fun, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rather than enjoying it, I&rsquo;m too busy responding to the situation at hand.</p>

<p>If I let my guard down even a little, things could get worse than they are now. Just like what happened in the bathroom before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll help myself to the snack~&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Senpai&rsquo;s cue, a warm breath blows onto my palm. It&rsquo;s as hot as what I felt against my back in the bath and just as sultry.</p>

<p>In fact, the softness of the lips pressing against my palm amplifies the sultriness of the breath.</p>

<p>Unable to contain myself any longer, I showed Senpai my vulnerable side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-Senpai&#8230; it tickles&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? I&rsquo;m just snacking~? If you don&rsquo;t like it, you could just shake me off~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite knowing that Senpai wouldn&rsquo;t simply accept my words of weakness with a &ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; I had inadvertently given her an opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides, I&rsquo;m ticklish too, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I doing something to you, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your hips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Wha-!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, what a cute reaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai presses her back against my chest, arching her body, and brings her mouth close to my face, whispering sweetly, making it impossible not to react.</p>

<p> My lover blows a gentle breath into my sensitive ear, her demeanor more devilish than before she took a sip of alcohol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t you feel like having a drink too by now? If you want, you can drink from mine, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her expression, clearly implying, &ldquo;Go ahead and drink,&rdquo; looks up at me.</p>

<p>My eyes are drawn to Senpai&rsquo;s half-finished can of Chuhai.</p>

<p>At this moment, it&rsquo;s not just the alcohol-coated lips that make my heart race, but even the thought of drinking from the same spot on the can where Senpai&rsquo;s lipstick-coated lips had been is thrilling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t hold back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the pounding of my heart and gulped down the remaining Chuhai in one go.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I no longer get overly excited about an indirect kiss.</p>

<p>Since living with Senpai, there have been far more thrilling things than that, and if I reacted to every indirect kiss, I simply wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s still true now&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was it? Delicious~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too sweet for me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you dislike it when it&rsquo;s too sweet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I dislike it? Rather&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather? What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strawberry-flavored alcohol lingers in my mouth, sweeter than I had expected.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not an unpleasant sweetness.</p>

<p>I recognize this sweetness. It&rsquo;s the kind that could melt my heart from the very bottom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like it, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like you too, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &mdash;Embracing each other while exchanging words of love, Senpai and I.</p>

<p>And soon, seeking the source of that sweetness, I forcefully push my tongue, coated with the strawberry-flavored alcohol, into Senpai&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>Even while drunk, my true desire to kiss Senpai is conveyed through the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; Mmh&#8230; &rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s sweet, trembling tongue spreads through my mouth.</p>

<p>The quiver in her throat echoes as a melting voice in my ears, and the sweetness on the tip of her tongue intensifies.</p>

<p>As I pull Senpai&rsquo;s shoulders and waist closer, her tongue trembles even more, making me want to embrace her even tighter. Naturally, my longing for Senpai&rsquo;s kiss grows stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230; I like you, Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&#8230; I like you too, Takashi-kun&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;CanI kiss you more?&rdquo;</p>

<p> As I pulled away from Senpai&rsquo;s lips, a transparent bridge that connected my lips to hers had formed.</p>

<p>The liquid bridge quickly melted away, leaving droplets to fall between us with a soft plop.</p>

<p>Seeing this, I yearned to witness that bridge once more, and I found myself seeking another kiss from Senpai, hoping she would accept.</p>

<p>But Senpai wasn&rsquo;t so indulgent as to easily grant a second kiss today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if I said no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d kiss you anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not saying no. In fact, I&rsquo;ll be the one to kiss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, with eyes moistened, turned her body and, gripping my neck, brought her lips to mine as if pecking at my tongue, returning the kiss I had initiated.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that she was simply accepting my kiss; she wanted to be the one to kiss me.</p>

<p>The proof lay in her expression, not one of mischief but the last one I had seen in the bathroom before the second kiss.</p>

<p>Of course, there was no reason for me not to accept a kiss from Senpai.</p>

<p>Even if that kiss were to become a painful one.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Mm&#8230; Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, you can call me by my name once in a while, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha&#8230; Senpai&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you try a little harder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, even if it meant leaping over the hurdle of calling out only Senpai&rsquo;s name, I would continue to accept her kisses.</p>

<p>For that purpose, I felt like I could do things I had been too embarrassed to do before.</p>

<p>No, I would do them. Now, in this moment, I would overcome the embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ku&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ku?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I was thinking of ways to make kissing Senpai more pleasant, I was still not used to it, and my voice came out haltingly.</p>

<p>Naturally, Senpai wouldn&rsquo;t let this pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped the kiss, prompting me to say her name.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t back down now, so I continued, calling out Senpai&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With each attempt I made at saying her name smoothly, Senpai&rsquo;s cheeks turned redder. Even without the lingering effects of the strawberry liquor, her lips were red, now even more moist and inviting.</p>

<p> Probably, even if I were to lean in now, Senpai wouldn&rsquo;t kiss me.</p>

<p>The reason was simple: I still hadn&rsquo;t done what Senpai was asking for.</p>

<p>If asked when to do it, I can answer immediately. Rather, now is the only time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to kiss you more, Kureha.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time, Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s lips meet mine slowly, as if syncing our breaths.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s third kiss is the sweetest and hottest of them all.</p>

<p>It seems it was a perfect hit.</p>

<p>Empty cans roll on the floor. The bag of snacks in my hand is upside down, and the contents, Chorippy, roll out with a clatter.</p>

<p>Without paying any attention to that, I continue kissing and hold Senpai tightly. Before I knew it, we were embracing face to face. Senpai&rsquo;s hand is placed on my back, and she is tracing it intermittently with her fingers.</p>

<p>My feelings naturally intensify.</p>

<p>I want to connect with Senpai more deeply&#8230;</p>

<p>As I try to quell the rising emotions with a kiss, we&rsquo;re interrupted again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Takashi-kun. Do you really think of Yuu-chan just as a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we talking about Yuu again&#8230;? Does it have to be now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to ask now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why now, of all times?</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m left with questions, I can&rsquo;t withstand the pressure of Senpai&rsquo;s earnest gaze.</p>

<p>Surely, if I ask &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll just end up giving in to Senpai&rsquo;s insistence.</p>

<p>So I decide to be honest about what I&rsquo;m thinking right now. If it makes Senpai feel better.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Just friends, of course. Whenever I&rsquo;m in trouble, I just ask that girl, and somehow it works out. She&rsquo;s been like a best friend since our first year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. A best friend, so that&rsquo;s why you carelessly let her into your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it turned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s intentional or not, Senpai&rsquo;s fingers teasingly stroke my back, and it tickles.</p>

<p>That, along with the way I stumble over my words in my last response, makes me want to laugh.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to ruin the mood by laughing though.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai doesn&rsquo;t seem to think I&rsquo;m concerned about such things and looks very relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Now I can kiss you all night long without any worries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&#8230; please spare me the all-nighter. I have classes tomorrow&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then try to make me surrender~. Of course, you can do more than just kiss, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than just a kiss&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t hide my agitation at the &ldquo;kiss you all night long&rdquo; that Senpai mentioned, feeling both allure and fear.</p>

<p>And also at the mention of doing more than kissing.</p>

<p>But Kureha Senpai, unconcerned with my turmoil, focuses on stimulating a certain point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like taking care of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahahaha! You jumped!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t been conscious of it while engrossed in kissing, the &ldquo;sensitive part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s soft bottom pushes against the hard part of me.</p>

<p> When she flicks the tip of that with her toe, there&rsquo;s no way I wouldn&rsquo;t twitch.</p>

<p>But Senpai, with a sudden change from the serious expression just moments ago, now wore a seductive look again.</p>

<p>I, who had long been captivated by Senpai&rsquo;s ever-changing expressions, asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, shall we continue our kiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With just a word or two, we shared our fourth kiss of the day.</p>
