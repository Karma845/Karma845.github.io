<p>Interlude</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, what am I doing. Really, I&rsquo;m such a mess&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left alone in the bathroom, I was in turmoil, agonizing over what I had impulsively done.</p>

<p>The reason was, of course, what had happened in the bathroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to do something a little naughty and see Takashi-kun blush, so why did it turn out like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The original plan was to enjoy seeing my blushing lover after teasing him a bit.</p>

<p>Maybe by flipping up my miniskirt to show off my more mature-looking shorts.</p>

<p>Or perhaps by having him take a photo of me half-undressed.</p>

<p> Of course, I wanted Takashi-kun to blush profusely.</p>

<p>But all those plans fell apart when he drew the bath page.</p>

<p>The situation turned against me, and my chance to tease my lover and heighten our affection was lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was planning to save that for later&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I disliked the idea of being affectionate with Takashi-kun in the bath.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I had dreamed of it and wanted to experience it someday.</p>

<p>I just never imagined that such a scenario would be in an erotic book.</p>

<p>And now, the scene I had been dreaming of alone was happening today. It was just a bit premature.</p>

<p>Well, I eventually would have ended up in the bath with him anyway.</p>

<p> If I had any wish, it was to do it after introducing Takashi-kun to my parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun&rsquo;s back was bigger and firmer than I thought&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I traced the soft skin with my hands, recalling the warmth and masculinity of my beloved.</p>

<p> Despite being a cute lover who always had a teasing edge, when we faced each other without any pretense, just a cloth between us, I was confronted with the reality that he was a man.</p>

<p>A sturdy frame, with no roundness, rough in places. And yet, his expression was adorable.</p>

<p>The contrast was almost too much to handle.</p>

<p>&#8230;No, that&rsquo;s why I ended up doing what I did in the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun probably won&rsquo;t notice&#8230; Well, it&rsquo;s better if he doesn&rsquo;t, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kiss on the neck.</p>

<p>Surely, my oblivious boyfriend wouldn&rsquo;t notice.</p>

<p>He must be aware that I kissed him, but he wouldn&rsquo;t understand the meaning. (hickey probably)</p>

<p>If he did, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tease him anymore.</p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s really too late, but still, I&rsquo;m not used to expressing my feelings in such a tangible way.</p>

<p>So please, don&rsquo;t notice?</p>

<p>If you knew how seriously I&rsquo;m attached to you, I&rsquo;d be embarrassed and probably become even worse&#8230;</p>

<p>Alone, feeling the ugliness of my own possessiveness, yet with no regrets about what happened in the bathroom, I even secretly hoped he would notice as I waited for my lover to return to the living room.</p>
