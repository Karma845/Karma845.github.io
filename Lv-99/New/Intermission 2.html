<h2>Interlude 2</h2>

<p>&ldquo;L-last night was too close&#8230;! I almost got swept away by Takashi-kun&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a brief respite, my heart still racing, I took a shower alone to calm down.</p>

<p>Alone, yet beyond one or two walls is my beloved. The only boy I&rsquo;ve ever loved.</p>

<p>Just thinking about him makes my heart flutter uncontrollably. There&rsquo;s no time to rest.</p>

<p>But still, I wanted some time alone to calm down.</p>

<p>If I were with Takashi-kun now, I&rsquo;d surely want to go beyond just kissing.</p>

<p>And yet, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to feel like going to university. I don&rsquo;t want to be away from Takashi-kun.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really started to think about nothing but Takashi-kun, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mutter to myself. It&rsquo;s a life now filled with Takashi-kun, something unimaginable when we first met.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a crush, but still a crush. Once you&rsquo;ve fallen, you keep falling all the way. It&rsquo;s terrifying and unbearable to fall into the pit of love.</p>

<p> But now, there&rsquo;s someone willing to fall with me. Someone to enjoy love with.</p>

<p>So, well&#8230; maybe that&rsquo;s okay&#8230;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped? I&rsquo;ve fallen in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I voice my conscious feelings. Even as I try to stay calm, my love grows stronger.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think I&rsquo;ve calmed down a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s keep the tension moderate and do our best today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I slap my cheeks firmly like preparing for a pep talk. It&rsquo;s my usual routine, a habit to avoid showing any weakness to Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t we all want to be a slightly different version of ourselves in front of the one we love?</p>

<p>I think to myself as I finish taking a shower and tuck my hair to the right side of my head like I do when I meet him.</p>
