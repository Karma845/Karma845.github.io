<h2>Chapter 1: Can Legally Drinking Alcohol and Living Together After Turning Twenty</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Takashi-kun. Now that you&rsquo;ve finally turned twenty, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time we start living together or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Important decisions always seem to come out of the blue, and they never seem to give you time to think.</p>

<p>There she is, a woman wafting a mature air around her, luring me with her sweet voice. A beautiful woman with crimson hair tied to the side of her head, wearing a loose T-shirt that generously reveals the cleavage of her chest. She doesn&rsquo;t seem to care that her black underwear is faintly visible through her thin shirt.</p>

<p>With her lips slightly moistened and a mischievous smile on her face, several empty cans lie beside her. There are well-known brands of alcohol cans scattered around, like Asahi Super Dry, and in her hand, a can of Lemon Sour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha-senpai, how about we switch from alcohol to juice? Look, there&rsquo;s your favorite Mr. Pepper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I take the half-finished can of Lemon Hall from the crimson-haired beauty Ootani Kureha-senpai and hand her her favorite drink instead.</p>

<p>But it seems like a big mistake to take away the alcohol from Kureha-senpai even if it&rsquo;s her favorite.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Which one is more important to you, living together or alcohol!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Kureha-senpai blurts out some nonsense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about which is more important. If I have to say, it&rsquo;s Senpai who&rsquo;s important. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I don&rsquo;t want to give a careless answer and hurt her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Kureha-senpai. We&rsquo;re still kids. We&rsquo;re not in a position to just decide to live together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-one. You, as of today, are twenty. We&rsquo;re both adults. Yay, we&rsquo;re grown-ups! Let&rsquo;s live together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really twenty-one, Senpai? Your thinking is quite childish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Are you saying it&rsquo;s bad that I&rsquo;m drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your usual state is bad enough, but today is particularly awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You always say I&rsquo;m cute though~ Why don&rsquo;t we just get married quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I truly care about Senpai from the bottom of my heart. Yet, my intentions never seem to get through to Kureha-senpai.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying she&rsquo;s bad, and just because we&rsquo;ve turned twenty doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re adults. At least, a university senpai who proposes something beyond living together on a drunken whim doesn&rsquo;t seem like an adult to me.</p>

<p> Moreover, she&rsquo;s not joking at all. She asks, &ldquo;Shall we get married?&rdquo; with a serious face, which makes her seem even further from being an adult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Senpai. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to live with you. I&rsquo;m just worried about whether your parents would approve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ve already told them that maybe I&rsquo;ll move in when my boyfriend turns twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t your family a bit too laid-back, Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I feel happy that Kureha Senpai introduces me as her &ldquo;boyfriend&rdquo; to her family, I can&rsquo;t help but worry because the content of what she&rsquo;s telling them is not okay at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmph, the key to my heart isn&rsquo;t that easy to turn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy! Way too easy! The padlock on your heart melted into a puddle the moment we started dating!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because Takashi-kun&rsquo;s heart is too hot~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This Senpai is hopeless. I need to do something about her soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but worry about Senpai&rsquo;s inability to communicate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Did you start to dislike me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be putting up with your comedy act if I did, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yay~. Just as I expected from the man I chose~! Go, Junon Boy!!!&rdquo; (TV show)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that taking Junon Boy too lightly!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> From a smitten, melted expression to a teary, anxious one, and then back to being smitten again.</p>

<p>Instead of hating her, Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s constantly changing moods make me fall for her even more. She&rsquo;s a drunkard that totally dependent on her kouhai (junior) like me, yet in front of others, she&rsquo;s a beautiful woman who shows no weakness. But behind the scenes, she&rsquo;s messaging me, &ldquo;I want to see you, I want to see you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m utterly captivated by Kureha Senpai, who has me wrapped around her finger.</p>

<p>Even today, I was secretly happy when Kureha Senpai said she wanted to celebrate my twentieth birthday. I never imagined that she would bring up living together after getting drunk by herself.</p>

<p>I had been hoping that there might be a chance, and I want a little bit of my feelings back that I had put in that hope.</p>

<p>To end up in a bed on the anniversary of turning twenty&mdash;</p>

<p> Ah, no, it&rsquo;s no good. It&rsquo;s even more embarrassing when I think about it. No matter how much I like Senpai, there are things that are okay to think about and things that are not. What I was thinking just now is definitely one of the things that&rsquo;s not okay&#8230;!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writhing. Writhing at the alluring expression of Senpai that I had conjured up in my mind. And writhing in shame at my own greed for letting my desires take over and go further than I should have.</p>

<p>Writhing and writhing, I&rsquo;m consumed by embarrassment until I can no longer see Senpai who is right beside me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong!? Don&rsquo;t tell me, you&rsquo;ve come to seriously dislike me!!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;eh&rsquo; me. You&rsquo;ve been holding your head in your hands, and I thought maybe I went too far and you hated me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never imagined that I would make Senpai worry about me. Senpai&rsquo;s face, peering into mine as I held my head, was filled with a sense of sorrow that was almost terrifying.</p>

<p>Hate? The words of my lover, spoken with such a sad expression, squeezed my heart tightly.</p>

<p>What am I doing, I thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. I haven&rsquo;t come to dislike you at all! I was just thinking that I might have jumped to conclusions, that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While pushing away the pain that almost made my initial words choke, I denied Senpai&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>Dislike? Why? Why would I have to dislike Senpai?</p>

<p>I love the time I spend with Senpai more than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? You really haven&rsquo;t come to dislike me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t come to dislike you at all. I confessed because I find it fun when Senpai teases me, and I wanted to joke around with you even more, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? Then, I&rsquo;m glad&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, relieved, returned to her usual gentle expression. Seeing my lover like that, I too felt relieved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad. If even a little of my feelings got through, that was enough for me.</p>

<p>Satisfied, I let my guard down, not even realizing that I had given Senpai an opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Takashi-kun, can I ask you something?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;W-what is it&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mentioned earlier that we were being to hasty&#8230;, and I&rsquo;ve been wondering, what kind of misunderstanding was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai hadn&rsquo;t missed that. Even while feeling down, she was diligently searching for material to tease me with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no match for her. Truly, I&rsquo;m no match for this Senpai. Her smile, now back to its usual mischief, is something I simply can&rsquo;t contend with. Today, its especially seems impossible to compete.</p>

<p>Unlike any other day, today is special. It&rsquo;s my twentieth birthday, and it&rsquo;s also the day she proposed we move in together.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m more nervous than ever, because times like these invariably lead to something going wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t talk about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more curious I get if you say that~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not okay. You must have one or two secrets you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be known to me too, right, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Takashi-kun really wants to know, I can talk about them as much as you&rsquo;d like~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, your face is all red. You&rsquo;re really cute, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See, just as I thought. She overwhelms me with her incredibly sweet voice if I try to fight back even a little.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Cute&rdquo; She says that while gently stroking the edge of my face with the back of her index finger. With a half-finished lemonade in one hand, she continues to dote on me.</p>

<p>This is unbearably pleasant, and it&rsquo;s a real problem. It makes me fall for Senpai even more when what I really want is for Senpai to fall for me more&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, please double-check with your family again! That&rsquo;s where the conversation should start!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll ask them right now~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to get scolded by my parents in the end. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve resigned myself to when Kureha Senpai makes a call to her family. The Senpai who was just now overwhelmed with a sense of tragedy is nowhere to be seen, nor is the Senpai who loves to tease me. It&rsquo;s just a seriously attractive woman, Ootani Kureha, sitting beside me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, hello mom? You know, about the living together thing we talked about the other day, is it okay to talk about it now? Yeah. That&rsquo;s right, about the boyfriend I mentioned before&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person Senpai is calling is her mother. I can hear her mother&rsquo;s relaxed voice leaking through. I can&rsquo;t make out the words, but judging by Senpai&rsquo;s expression, they must be kind to her.</p>

<p>I feel relieved seeing the seemingly good relationship between Senpai and her mother.</p>

<p>That aside, it seems they really had talked about living together before, which makes me worry about their family relationship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m lost in thought watching Senpai on the phone, Kureha Senpai gives me a sweet look and lightly tugs at the hem of my shirt.</p>

<p> Phone.</p>

<p>Her lips, wet from the alcohol, move to convey that word to me. They open, close for a moment, and then open again. When they open the second time, I think I hear a small popping sound, but it&rsquo;s probably just my imagination.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s lips are so glossy, I can&rsquo;t help but wish she would make a &ldquo;Mwah&#8230;&rdquo; sound.</p>

<p>It must be just a weird desire because I&rsquo;m a little bit indulgent today.</p>

<p>While aware of my excitement about spending my birthday with my lover, I nod vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it. Just wait a sec&#8230; Takashi-kun, my mom says she has something she wants to tell you at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hands me the smartphone that&rsquo;s still on the call. The screen reads &ldquo;Mom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;ve taken over the phone, Suzuki Takashi speaking. I&rsquo;ve been in a relationship with Kureha-san for about a year now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I greet her cautiously, pressing the phone to my ear. I try to be as polite as possible, to be worthy of being Senpai&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re quite proper, aren&rsquo;t you? I thought you&rsquo;d be more&#8230; well&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More&#8230;? Is there something wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s not something to bring up now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first impression I had when I heard her mother&rsquo;s voice was one of warmth. It reminded me of Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s laid-back way of speaking. But it wasn&rsquo;t just that; I could also sense a mother&rsquo;s firmness. That was the impression I got.</p>

<p>And that impression continued even as we got to the main topic.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, right. About the living together matter, if Kureha is okay with it, I don&rsquo;t mind at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That easily&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given it some thought, you know? Even though she&rsquo;s an adult, she&rsquo;s still my dear, dear daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence. I found myself unable to speak. No, it felt like I shouldn&rsquo;t speak. I didn&rsquo;t have the words to interject into her serious conversation. It was clear how much she cared for Kureha Senpai, even in her relaxed manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, if my daughter prefers to be with you&#8230; with Takashi-san, then I&rsquo;m happy to send her off.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, thank you so much&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel grateful. Grateful for her mother&rsquo;s decision to acknowledge the relationship between Kureha Senpai and me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but do be careful, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful&#8230;? About what exactly&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If anything happens to Kureha, you know how her father will become&#8230; I think you&rsquo;re sensible enough to understand what I mean by that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I swallowed hard. Her father. Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s father. The man Senpai herself often complained about as being strict.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t afford to make a mistake. Instantly, I realized I was being warned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;m all for the relationship, just so you know~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as her mother&rsquo;s words of approval were spoken, I was struck by the enormity of the warning she had just given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, please take good care of Kureha~&rdquo;</p>

<p>The call ended abruptly, yet her voice remained calm and carefree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Mom talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; take care of her daughter&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Classic Mom. Quick and to the point and makes things easier for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I handed back the smartphone, and there was Senpai, looking anxious, asking about the outcome. Upon closer inspection, I noticed she was tightly gripping the hem of my shirt.</p>

<p>Even if the family had been informed, it didn&rsquo;t guarantee a favorable outcome. This uncertainty was casting a shadow over Senpai&rsquo;s expression.</p>

<p>Of course, her face brightened up immediately after I shared the good news.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so much a transformation as a return to her usual self. I always want Senpai to be happy and energetic.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I like you, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you too, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, I know that. I know very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today was my sweet twentieth birthday, a day I had hoped would be special. And on this day, I received parental approval for us to live together.</p>

<p>It was too much of a surprise for someone like me who couldn&rsquo;t even drink alcohol yesterday yet&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, from tomorrow, we&rsquo;ll be living together, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;so&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s way too soon to start living together from tomorrow! And what about your stuff? Surely you can&rsquo;t be ready to move in today or tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No problem there! I&rsquo;ve been preparing everything for today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a huge problem! And what were you planning to do if I said no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you drunk if I have to, but I&rsquo;ll make sure to get a marriage promise from you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if I can legally drink from today, isn&rsquo;t that a little underhanded!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I just want to spend more time with you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai pleads with me with her cute face and a sexy pose that doesn&rsquo;t quite match. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be shaken by her.</p>

<p>One moment she&rsquo;s giggling, the next, she&rsquo;s confidently smirking.</p>

<p>Then she leans forward in her loose T-shirt, a mischievous look on her face, and with slightly puffed cheeks, she sends a love call, saying, &ldquo;I want to be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could anyone stay calm in the face of such an overwhelming assault? Could anyone&rsquo;s heart not race? I certainly couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Especially since just a moment ago, I had seen a vulnerable side of her&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, you&rsquo;re so cute when you&rsquo;re embarrassed, Takashi-kun~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re teasing me, Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>My feelings for Kureha Senpai spill over onto my face, and she notices. No, even if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious, my feelings must have been clear to Senpai all along.</p>

<p>Because she knows, Senpai teases me even more. She&rsquo;s Ootani Kureha, a troublesome person who is one year my senior.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m hopelessly in love with such a Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious about everything I&rsquo;m saying, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;About the promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting drunk&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course also serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could seriously marry you, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, I can&rsquo;t help but worry about you, Senpai, who&rsquo;s already concerned about marriage&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She answered my questions smoothly, as if she knew what I wanted to ask without me having to say a word. Moreover, she provided an answer when I was hesitating about whether to ask that question. And the look in Senpai&rsquo;s eyes was dead serious.</p>

<p>It was all happening too fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai appealed to me again with those teary eyes. I have an undeniable weakness for that look.</p>

<p>Ah&#8230; I can&rsquo;t help it&#8230; My true feelings are slipping out&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to&#8230; It&rsquo;s just not that easy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though I think it&rsquo;s too soon, my feelings are honest, and I find myself dreaming about sharing both the good times and the bad with Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>Despite neglecting my work, not being sure if I can graduate, and not even knowing if Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s feelings will change, I still dream about it and then fall into a state of self-loathing, thinking, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too soon to be considering this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s precisely because of these strong feelings that I can&rsquo;t remain unfazed by Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s serious gaze. However, as inexperienced as I am, I still can&rsquo;t fully grasp how serious Kureha Senpai is.</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you worry about me like that that I end up wanting to marry you~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as a preliminary step to that, living together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just too sudden&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p> Her expressions change rapidly.</p>

<p>In between, the beautiful woman with crimson hair sips her Lemon Sour. Her lips, damp from the drink, look more seductive than usual, yet the content of our conversation is anything but seductive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it through quite thoroughly on my part, but maybe I should have consulted you first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have appreciated a heads up for the sake of mental preparation, to be honest. To suddenly start living together from today or tomorrow is just too abrupt&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea of living together might be Senpai&rsquo;s version of a birthday surprise, but it&rsquo;s definitely beyond the scale of a regular surprise.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m not happy about it. I&rsquo;ve even dreamed of marrying Senpai, so there&rsquo;s no point in trying to deceive myself now, and in front of Senpai, I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of pretending otherwise.</p>

<p>However, as a male college student, there was one issue with welcoming her into my place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like I said before, it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to live with Senpai, okay? It&rsquo;s just that&#8230; there are things I need to tidy up&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry~. I&rsquo;ll help you~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m worried about&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is that, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing me fumble with my words, Kureha Senpai seemed a bit puzzled.</p>

<p>I hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t notice, but that hope was fleeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed she had caught on.</p>

<p>No, not yet. If Senpai didn&rsquo;t actually say it out loud, I could still claim she hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything. Yes, let&rsquo;s go with that!! Please let it be so!!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! I won&rsquo;t be put off, no matter how abnormal the books you have are, Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My wishful thinking was shattered by the words that came with Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s beaming smile.</p>

<p>And to think that she would even find out where I kept those kinds of books&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> &ldquo;Breast special? Okay. Tanned girls collection? No, thigh heaven? Well, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, Senpai is in the midst of checking my erotic magazines, and all I can do is silently watch this unfold.</p>

<p>How miserable am I?</p>

<p>To prevent this from happening, I had hidden my erotic magazines very carefully&#8230; very carefully indeed&#8230;</p>

<p>Knowing that it would be dangerous to show my erotic magazines to a teasing Senpai, I had meticulously checked and prepared the perfect hiding spot for them, anticipating her visit today.</p>

<p>And where was that? Behind a hollow space under my bed.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn&rsquo;t just put them there. I created a fake wall to make it look like there was no hollow space at all.</p>

<p>It was so well crafted that at first glance, no one would suspect there was a hollow space behind the bed.</p>

<p>I had entrusted all the details to a friend from the architecture department, so the craftsmanship was guaranteed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I placed a box filled with unused cables under the bed and squeezed more reference books behind the reference book area on the bookshelf to create a decoy, all in an effort to divert Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s attention from the fake wall behind the bed.</p>

<p>Without even glancing at either side, she immediately reached behind the bed to the disguised wall.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, there&rsquo;s no need to hide it. It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re setting traps so weird that I&rsquo;m tempted to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai then started sorting through my treasured stash of erotic magazines that were hidden behind the fake wall.</p>

<p>On her left side, she placed the ones she reacted positively to, and on the right, the ones she didn&rsquo;t like.</p>

<p>&rdquo; &lsquo;Shall we have fun with the red-haired heroine?&rsquo; Sure, that&rsquo;s fine. The blue-haired heroine? No, absolutely not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said, reading the titles of the erotic magazines one by one and sorting them to the left or right.</p>

<p>I sat there in proper seiza, watching her work. That was all I could do, being someone who easily found satisfaction in erotic magazines despite having a beautiful red-haired girlfriend like Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I guess that&rsquo;s it. Takashi-kun, look this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p> It seemed she had finished sorting the erotic magazines, as Kureha Senpai called my name.</p>

<p>Slowly, I raised my head to look at her, trying to gauge her mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you smiling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked, surprised to see a content Kureha Senpai in front of me. I had assumed she would be angry, so her demeanor instilled a bit of fear in me. But there she was, unmistakably the usual Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Takashi-kun, did you really want to do naughty things with me that badly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who else could it be saying such outrageous things if not the usual Kureha Senpai?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s usually the breasts and thighs you&rsquo;re always looking at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, what are you talking about?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea what Senpai is talking about. Is she suggesting that me looking at her chest and thighs is connected to the &lsquo;naughty&rsquo; stuff she&rsquo;s talking about in erotic magazines?</p>

<p>Indeed, I can&rsquo;t deny that my gaze does wander to Senpai&rsquo;s cleavage and her thighs, but that&rsquo;s a different matter entirely.</p>

<p>I find myself internally swayed by the usual outrageous Senpai, and here she goes saying strange things again.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I mean, you were consoling yourself with this book as a substitute for me, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No comment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have the right to remain silent, so please answer properly~&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems there&rsquo;s no escape. Could this be retribution for being satisfied with erotic magazines despite having a girlfriend like her?</p>

<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s not like I could have just abstained from the magazines and approached her directly. That would be impossible.</p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;d probably just be teased and skillfully brushed off.</p>

<p>After all, it&rsquo;s been almost a year since we started dating and we&rsquo;ve still not gone beyond almost kissing.</p>

<p>Even when the mood was right, she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Not yet&#9825;&rdquo; and disrupt the moment by placing her index finger between our lips.</p>

<p>I could never tell her, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand erotic magazines anymore, please do something naughty with me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly tell her that I&rsquo;ve been consoling myself alone with the magazines as a substitute for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, maybe I&rsquo;ll do some of the things depicted in the book for you if you answer properly? Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t make you throw them away or anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it. Almost every day, I&rsquo;ve been comforting myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that honest side of you too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she herself is offering to do naughty things, that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve cleared my mind in the face of sexual desire.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s a natural physiological response. I&rsquo;m a healthy male college student, after all.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with relying on erotic magazines?</p>

<p>Especially when I have permission from my lover, that&rsquo;s even better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, about the remaining books&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation up to now was about the book on the left.</p>

<p>And now, Kureha Senpai is pointing to the books on the right, the ones she reacted unfavorably to.</p>

<p>But, I&rsquo;m sure the good-natured Senpai I see now would forgive even an undesirable book. I&rsquo;m confident about that.</p>

<p>After all, the Senpai before me is unusually smiley today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we burn it on the stove now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;What did you just say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear? I said to burn the book that has no resemblance to me right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could it be that you&rsquo;re actually quite angry&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai continues to smile sweetly. Her reaction says it all, and yet, it&rsquo;s the scariest I&rsquo;ve ever seen her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today is my birthday. It&rsquo;s also the day my collection of erotic magazines was reduced by half&#8230;</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now that the cleaning is done, happy birthday once again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-ahaha&#8230; thank you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After gathering the remnants of the erotic magazines that burned and scattered on the stove, Kureha Senpai and I sit down on the living room cushions, looking exhausted.</p>

<p>Senpai had thought they would burn nicely, never expecting the wind from the stove&rsquo;s burner to blow them away. Her flustered figure was a bit cute, and I almost burst out laughing.</p>

<p>However, the shock of burning the erotic magazines with my own hands was huge, and it seemed like I wouldn&rsquo;t recover from it for a while. With a solemn expression, I could only respond to Senpai&rsquo;s birthday wishes with a wry smile.</p>

<p>Even in front of such a me, Senpai remained herself, her carefree voice echoing in the heavy atmosphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m not that much of a demon. I&rsquo;ll prepare something to apologize.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;An apology, like what for example&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, how about a naughty photo book of myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious, your own creation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even get it properly printed and bound by a printing service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need to go that far!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I still can&rsquo;t read Senpai&rsquo;s thoughts at all, but I at least understood that I shouldn&rsquo;t dwell on anything that doesn&rsquo;t remind me of Senpai.</p>

<p>I understand Senpai&rsquo;s anxiety. I wouldn&rsquo;t like it either if Senpai was fantasizing about other men besides me. The erotic magazines that we ended up burning were a small price to pay if it helped ease Senpai&rsquo;s worries.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal if I just stopped being distracted by girls with tanned or blue hair and did something more with Senpai.</p>

<p>Yeah, if Senpai would let me have some physical contact without teasing, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue at all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>While I understand Senpai&rsquo;s insecurities, I start to feel anxious myself, &ldquo;Does Senpai really like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know Senpai isn&rsquo;t the type to casually suggest living together with someone she doesn&rsquo;t like, but since we haven&rsquo;t even kissed yet, I can&rsquo;t help but worry, &ldquo;Is Senpai&rsquo;s &lsquo;like&rsquo; not really &lsquo;love&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to these concerns, the idea of hiring a printing service doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me.</p>

<p>If we use a service to print a book, at least the workers there would end up seeing Senpai&rsquo;s selfies. Senpai&rsquo;s naughty selfies&#8230;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s something I want to prevent at all costs. I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to see Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s naughty selfie photos. It&rsquo;s enough that only I know about Senpai&rsquo;s slightly wild side.</p>

<p>Still, I can&rsquo;t bring myself to tell her directly&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try drinking some alcohol, Takashi-kun? I&rsquo;ve bought some that even beginners can enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, yes! Please go easy on me!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was handed a glass and had cheerfully replied. It&rsquo;s a bad habit of mine. I can&rsquo;t break the flow and end up letting my thoughts and feelings slide without expressing what I really want to say.</p>

<p>Everything&rsquo;s just sliding by. I can&rsquo;t confirm whether Senpai truly likes me, I can&rsquo;t express my desire to kiss her, and naturally, anything beyond that&#8230;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my birthday, and yet I&rsquo;m starting to dislike myself a little. It&rsquo;s my first birthday with a girlfriend, but my mood just keeps sinking.</p>

<p>To break out of this state, I decided to drink the alcohol Senpai recommended without hesitation, hoping to lift my spirits a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, try the Calpico Sour. It&rsquo;s low in alcohol content and has an easy-to-drink sweetness, so it&rsquo;s recommended for your first drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of like Calpico soda!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s basically that soda with alcohol in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweet tartness spread through my mouth, followed by a faint sense of discomfort.</p>

<p>Surely, this aftertaste must be the flavor of alcohol.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought. On the contrary, I felt my spirits lifting. The gloominess that weighed on me seemed to lighten.</p>

<p>Encouraged, I grabbed the next drink after Senpai introduced it and took a big gulp.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Next up, Choya Umeshu. It&rsquo;s a classic among classics, so it&rsquo;s worth remembering the taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It kinda tastes like those plum juice drinks you see in vending machines, pretty good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s plum, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intense aroma of plum hit my nose directly, and the delicious taste spread across my tongue. Unlike when I drank the Calpico Sour, there was no discomfort, just the pure deliciousness of the plum itself.</p>

<p>However, what I was drinking was definitely alcohol, and I could feel a tingling sensation throbbing at the back of my throat.</p>

<p>Still, the &ldquo;high&rdquo; I wanted to feel was far off. In the end, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate to reach for the last drink that was prepared&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finally, this one. You&rsquo;ve got to try it at least once. Asahi Super Dry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitter&#8230;! But there&rsquo;s a subtle taste&#8230; this could become addictive&#8230;!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good job! You might be ready to drink outside soon!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite Senpai&rsquo;s happy reaction, I was filled with joy inside. My head felt light and airy, yet my excitement was rising.</p>

<p>I was quietly delighted to have reached the &ldquo;high&rdquo; I had been seeking.</p>

<p>But my self-satisfied joy was short-lived as my vision suddenly distorted.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey&#8230; Senpai, did you learn magc tricks? Everything&rsquo;s looking really wobbly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drunk at all!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People who insist they&rsquo;re not drunk are usually the worst off. Just wait here, I&rsquo;ll go get you some water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying that, Kureha Senpai tried to step away from me for a moment. Without realizing it, I had grabbed onto the hem of Senpai&rsquo;s shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Takashi-kun&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, I want to ask&#8230; do you&#8230; really like me&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though I was supposed to be feeling high-spirited, words that sounded not so manly slipped out of my mouth. My head felt light and fluffy, yet my emotions were heavy and oppressive.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Of course I like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230;? It&rsquo;s not some kind of joke, is it&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way. I truly like only you. I&rsquo;m seriously in love with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&#8230; please kiss me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wanted to stop myself, but the words I had been thinking in my heart kept spilling out of my mouth regardless of my will. The shackles I had been holding back fell from my eyes, and the overflowing anxiety reached Senpai&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai just stared at me intently with serious eyes. Her expression, so different from the frivolous one she had earlier, became serious.</p>

<p>With her lips moistened by alcohol, she slightly opened them and asked softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Do you want to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to kiss you, Kureha Senpai&#8230; Don&rsquo;t you feel the same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>More of my true feelings spilled out. My anxiety spilled out.</p>

<p>My desire to become more intimate with Senpai grew.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit pathetic that it&rsquo;s only about a kiss, which seems like me&#8230; But I can&rsquo;t do something irresponsible. Just because I turned twenty doesn&rsquo;t mean I can take responsibility for everything&#8230;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If anything happens to Kureha, you know how her father will become&#8230;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The voice of Senpai&rsquo;s mother echoed in my mind. Even though I had her blessing, the fear of that &lsquo;something&rsquo; would happen prevented me from moving forward.</p>

<p>I had heard several times from Senpai herself that her father was strict.</p>

<p>But still&#8230; a kiss should be okay for now, right&#8230;?</p>

<p>I wait. I wait for Senpai&rsquo;s reply with anticipation. Anticipating what answer she will give me. Anticipating those lips touching my skin. But, it&rsquo;s times like these that Senpai can be so mean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I want to. But maybe not right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it because you don&rsquo;t really like me&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not it. I just don&rsquo;t want to give away something important in the heat of the moment when you&rsquo;re drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Senpai sits down next to me again, takes a half-finished bottle of tea from her bag, and presses it to my mouth.</p>

<p>The tea that was suddenly poured into my mouth tasted several times stronger and more bitter than usual, almost unrecognizable from Senpai&rsquo;s preferred sweet tea.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, wait for the kiss until morning, okay? I&rsquo;ll stay right by your side until then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Defeated by the alcohol, I close my eyes as if sinking down, and thus my birthday comes to an end.</p>

<p>Far from the birthday I had fantasized about, I savor the bitterness.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230; my head hurts&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brightness of the sun peeking through the gap in the curtains wakes my consciousness that had sunk to the depths.</p>

<p> In stark contrast to the refreshing morning sunlight, my head throbs with a dull pain. It&rsquo;s a different kind of headache, one that urges reflection. It seems I&rsquo;m not quite ready for alcohol yet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did I fall asleep&#8230;? I don&rsquo;t even remember getting into bed&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I scratch my head, trying to distract myself from the pain as I attempt to recall the events of the previous day, but there&rsquo;s a gap in my memory right around the time I started drinking.</p>

<p>I remember downing one drink after another, recommended by Senpai, in an attempt to drown out my anxious feelings towards them, but I can&rsquo;t remember what we talked about or how I felt after that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, this smell&#8230;? Is it coming from the kitchen&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I focus on the source of the nostalgic scent that&rsquo;s faintly wafting through the room, I see Kureha Senpai, who is completely different from yesterday, standing there, the very picture of reliability.</p>

<p>Even though she&rsquo;s wearing the same thin T-shirt as the day before, just standing in the kitchen makes her seem like a completely different person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm? What do you mean? I&rsquo;m making breakfast. Especially after drinking, miso soup in the morning is the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, didn&rsquo;t you go home&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I leave someone who got drunk for the first time on his own and just go home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that might be true, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;d take care of me if I were completely smashed, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. There&rsquo;s no way I could just leave you like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though Senpai is usually sloppy, she&rsquo;s still responsible at the important moments.</p>

<p>It makes my heart skip a beat. It&rsquo;s even more striking because she&rsquo;s turning only her face towards me while her back is still turned.</p>

<p>When I look down, I see her thighs revealed by her short pants, and my heart races again at the sight of her backside pushing against the thin blue denim fabric.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we made a promise, remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A promise&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind then, that&rsquo;s another story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai turns around again with that mature expression, and the glimpse of her neat ears beneath her tidy crimson hair makes my heart race even faster.</p>

<p>But life with Senpai isn&rsquo;t always sweet enough to let me feel this excited for long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go wash your face or something? Your bedhead is pretty wild.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurriedly pressed down my hair, but it was already too late. I could tell just by touching it how messy it looked. While I was getting all worked up over Senpai&rsquo;s gestures, she must have been chuckling at my crazy hair.</p>

<p>With that thought, I couldn&rsquo;t help but blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to hide it. You won&rsquo;t be able to hide it anyway once we start living together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not living together yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got to know Takashi-kun&rsquo;s cute side before anyone else. Lucky me, what a deal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bed hair is cute? I really don&rsquo;t understand your standards of cuteness, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the bed hair that&rsquo;s cute, it&rsquo;s your flustered look that&rsquo;s adorable~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unaware of my feelings, Kureha Senpai teases me as usual.</p>

<p>While feeling a bit relieved that the topic of &ldquo;living together&rdquo; Senpai mentioned yesterday hadn&rsquo;t disappeared, I also countered her teasing in my usual way.</p>

<p>But, as always, I never seem to win against Senpai&rsquo;s teasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I&rsquo;ll fix it right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your time~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it super fast!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, I found myself rushing to the washroom.</p>

<p>With Senpai&rsquo;s carefree voice behind me, I realize I&rsquo;m grinning as usual.</p>

<p>Even though I know this is why she keeps teasing me.</p>

<p>In front of the mirror stands a black-haired male university student. In his mind was a red-haired beautiful female student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a good match for her&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I feel my insecurities smoldering as I compare my appearance with that of my girlfriend, who&rsquo;s always by my side.</p>

<p>My features are well-defined, and I&rsquo;m not what you&rsquo;d call &ldquo;ugly,&rdquo; but I can&rsquo;t help comparing myself to Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>Do I really match up with her?</p>

<p>Even though I believe Senpai isn&rsquo;t the kind of person to judge others solely by their looks, there&rsquo;s a part of me that&rsquo;s still concerned.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m weak. I&rsquo;m afraid that the reality of Senpai liking me might one day shatter and become a dream.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s easier to think from the start that we&rsquo;re not a match.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought until yesterday, when I heard about &ldquo;living together&rdquo; and &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; from Senpai&rsquo;s own lips nearly a year later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to pull myself together&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> Senpai genuinely likes me. Whether her talk of &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; is serious or a joke, I can&rsquo;t be sure, but I know she cares for me. I can&rsquo;t afford to keep looking backward when she&rsquo;s right in front of me and showing me such affection.</p>

<p>I must strengthen my weak self, my fragile heart, even if it&rsquo;s just a little at a time. I need to start now and continue even after we &ldquo;move in together&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With that firm resolve, I finished fixing my hair and made my way to the living room where Senpai was waiting.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>

<p>The room was filled with the delicious aroma of food, and the dishes laid out seemed to embody that enticing smell.</p>

<p>Fried eggs, sausages, shredded cabbage, and tofu miso soup&mdash;a typical Japanese breakfast spread across the table.</p>

<p>The one who prepared it was undoubtedly my girlfriend, Kureha Senpai. As I began to eat, I recalled the image of her in the kitchen this morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really looked the part doing the housework, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? If so, then it was worth the effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you often help out at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mom taught me all the household chores so that I could prepare a breakfast like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Oh, is that so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must have been preparation with our &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; in mind. That thought made me a bit unsure of how to react.</p>

<p>The prospect of seeing a scene like this every single day, not just every morning, once we start living together filled me with an indescribable joy. At the same time, I held back my excitement, expecting to be teased about it.</p>

<p>But it seemed she had anticipated even that. Seeing my reaction, she leaned in with a mischievous smile and teased me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you embarrassed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really not embarrassed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m not embarrassed&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then look at me~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&#8230; I can&rsquo;t do that right now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re blushing, aren&rsquo;t you~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under Senpai&rsquo;s relentless charm, I finally fell.</p>

<p> No, seriously, is there any guy who wouldn&rsquo;t blush when questioned by Kureha Senpai, who perfectly balances cuteness and beauty while she&rsquo;s peering into his face?</p>

<p>At least, I can&rsquo;t help it.</p>

<p>Even if I try to act like I&rsquo;m not embarrassed, my face naturally breaks into a grin, and when she tells me to look at her, I just can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Surely, or rather, undoubtedly, I&rsquo;d just grin even more and end up being teased by Senpai again. Even when I try to look away, I still end up being teased in the end.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai never stopped teasing me, so I decided to try a different approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, about the promise you mentioned earlier&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re changing the subject. You don&rsquo;t have to hide your embarrassment like that~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that about you, Takashi-kun~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of successfully changing the subject, I&rsquo;m completely seen through and teased even more.</p>

<p>I realize that I will probably continue to be teased by Senpai in the future.</p>

<p>Strangely, I find that I don&rsquo;t dislike it at all, something I&rsquo;m only now coming to terms with.</p>

<p>Just as I come to this realization, a serious voice from Senpai breaks through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember what happened last night when you were drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t apologize. If anything, I should be the one saying sorry. It seems I&rsquo;ve made you endure it quite a bit. Sorry for teasing you and causing you so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you told me last night in your drunken state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I apologized reflexively, but despite her serious tone, Senpai&rsquo;s expression was very gentle.</p>

<p>What intrigued me even more were the last words she said.</p>

<p> &#8213;&#8213;&#8213;That&rsquo;s what you told me last night in your drunken state.</p>

<p>What did I do yesterday? I wonder what I said to Senpai while I was drunk.</p>

<p>How much of my inner anxieties did I end up revealing?</p>

<p>I feel embarrassed for having explained things I didn&rsquo;t want to be known using my own words.</p>

<p>At the same time, I can&rsquo;t help but feel affection for Senpai, who worries about me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I probably won&rsquo;t be able to stop teasing you, but I really do like you from the bottom of my heart. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been holding back all this time. What if you hate me? What if you think I&rsquo;m easy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I would think like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, I knew it. That&rsquo;s why I like you. You&rsquo;re just that kind of person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a different reason than before, I now find it impossible to look at Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;m trying to hide my embarrassment. Senpai just looks so dear to me that I feel if I keep looking at her, I might lose all my reason, and that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t face her.</p>

<p>But when it comes to making important decisions, she always seem to come suddenly, without giving you any time to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, shall we do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without waiting for my response, Senpai stands up and gently cradles my face in her hands from across the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to stop at the last minute again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we talking about an indirect kiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a direct kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Nose to nose?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Mouth to mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I hesitantly ask questions, Senpai playfully presses my lips with her thumb.</p>

<p>When I sneak a glance at Senpai&rsquo;s face, her lips look moist, her eyes feverish.</p>

<p>The teasing Senpai is nowhere to be found. Instead, a lovestruck maiden is present.</p>

<p>I fall in love with Senpai yet again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you done with your questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m new to this, so please&#8230; go easy on me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, understood. I&rsquo;ll be gentle for your first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s lips, which curved into a smile, quickly drew closer to mine, and soon they gently touched.</p>

<p>It was just a gentle kiss, but it felt more intense than any fantasy I&rsquo;d ever had about Senpai and about all those things we could do.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter even if it was a kiss that tasted like miso soup.</p>
