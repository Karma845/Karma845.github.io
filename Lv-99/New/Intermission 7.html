<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>&ldquo;He was drinking my alcohol, wasn&rsquo;t he&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I close my eyes, I can&rsquo;t help but picture my lover, who usually wouldn&rsquo;t drink, choosing to drink on his own.</p>

<p>The fact that he prepared alcohol when I wasn&rsquo;t looking, by his own volition, was surprising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what he was up to&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not angry. I&rsquo;m not upset that he drank my alcohol.</p>

<p>After all, I bought it for us to drink together. In fact, I want him to drink more.</p>

<p>By seeing which bottles are getting emptier, I can tell Takashi-kun&rsquo;s preferences, which is quite convenient for me.</p>

<p>Still&#8230; I can&rsquo;t deny feeling a bit lonely that I couldn&rsquo;t drink with Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>No matter how much I want to get along with Yuu-chan, the loneliness is still there even if we could drink together over a video call. But, that aside&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage, huh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never imagined that Takashi-kun would propose to me. Even if it was spurred by the alcohol, I was incredibly happy.</p>

<p>And yet, there was a shock. I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated a proposal from Takashi-kun at all.</p>

<p>Feeling unusually nervous, I spent the whole night awake.</p>
