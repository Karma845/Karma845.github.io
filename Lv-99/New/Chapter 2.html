<h2>Chapter 2: Gradually Losing Places To Escape</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>A few days after my birthday, I cleaned my room and waited to welcome Senpai, who had sent her usual message, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming over today!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, can you unlock the door for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, but is something wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just felt like having Takashi-kun open the door for me today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you have days like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Feeling a bit odd about Senpai&rsquo;s unusual behavior since she usually had a spare key to my room, I nonetheless unlocked the door.</p>

<p>Waiting outside was the usual Kureha Senpai, along with some unfamiliar large luggage.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Um, Senpai&#8230; what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you asking? This is, of course, the set for moving in with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say it with such a &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that obvious!&rsquo; attitude&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai had brought two large pieces of luggage. One contained her clothes, makeup, and other personal items. The other held a set of matching dishes and a letter from Senpai&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t today a bit too sudden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how life is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you at least tell me the date? I&rsquo;m completely unprepared mentally!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blame God for not bestowing humans with the ability to foresee the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m complaining about you, Senpai!!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;What on earth did I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give me any time to prepare! Even yesterday, you came over to hang out and didn&rsquo;t say anything about today, and then you teased me about the kiss before leaving!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai is always so unpredictable. She brings up the idea of living together, keeps hiding the various things she&rsquo;s dealing with, continues to refuse kisses, and then, out of the blue, she kisses me during breakfast the other day.</p>

<p>Today is no different. Even though I knew about the plans to move in together, I was never told when it would start. Whenever I asked, I was just brushed off with a vague &ldquo;Hmm, I wonder when will that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, Senpai just gives me this smug look or plays dumb despite my annoyance, and I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that she&rsquo;s not really taking my words to heart.</p>

<p>Was it a jab at me for saying that moving in immediately was impossible on the day the topic was brought up?</p>

<p>No, that can&rsquo;t be it. If Senpai were to take a jab at me, it would be something more provocative. Instead, I suspect she might simply be enjoying my frustrated reactions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, I can&rsquo;t help it when I remember your reaction to our first kiss, you know? You were melting into the afterglow of the kiss that day and only giving me nothing but absent-minded responses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but recall that moment after seeing Senpai with a slight smile.</p>

<p>Senpai was dressed differently than the loose T-shirt she wore around the house. Now she wore a cute yet slightly small white shirt paired with a stylish black leather jacket.</p>

<p>Cuteness, coolness, sexiness, and that usual teasing expression &ndash; it was a combination that was more than enough to throw me off balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was my first kiss ever, so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you find yourself restless after it was over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to hide it. I was restless too, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re making that naughty face again. You&rsquo;re such a pervert~~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was teased again, and this time it hit the mark, causing even greater damage than usual.</p>

<p>But then again, how could I not be restless after a kiss with Kureha Senpai?</p>

<p>With just one glance, she could charm a crowd with her stunning appearance, and despite her frequent teasing, she had a bright personality that was somehow endearing to others.</p>

<p>If my lover tells me that she felt restless after kissing me, I can&rsquo;t help but blush. It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>

<p>I wonder how Senpai, who is usually so laid-back, becomes restless.</p>

<p>What kind of expressions does she make? What kind of sultry voice do she let out?</p>

<p>The more I think about Senpai, the deeper I fall into this trap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all joking aside, I didn&rsquo;t say anything until today because I didn&rsquo;t have the courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m a girl too. When it comes to living together, I don&rsquo;t want to show you my weird side and have you dislike me, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai suddenly switches to a serious expression as I&rsquo;m swayed by sweet words. For a moment, I didn&rsquo;t understand what Senpai was saying, but then I realized that Senpai is indeed also a girl who has her own concerns.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the erotic magazine from the other day that I&rsquo;d be embarrassed to be seen with. Senpai must feel the same.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just material things but also vulnerabilities and the things deep inside our hearts that we don&rsquo;t want to reveal.</p>

<p>I let some of it slip in a drunken moment, and Senpai did just before our first kiss.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;m convinced that what&rsquo;s at the bottom of our hearts must be the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in the end, I couldn&rsquo;t overcome my desire to be with you for a long time. The desire to see your weird side won over my fear of you seeing mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the smile of teasing. It was Senpai&rsquo;s genuine affectionate smile directed at me.</p>

<p>Faced with such a smile from Senpai, I was overwhelmed by a feeling of restlessness greater than that of our first kiss.</p>

<p>Ah, I really can&rsquo;t compete with you, Senpai&#8230;</p>

<p>I murmured this to myself.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> &lsquo;Please take care of my selfish daughter for many years to come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was what was written in the letter from Senpai&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;That&rsquo;s heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What would you call it? I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that I&rsquo;m being told, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare part with my precious daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m planning to break up with Senpai or anything, but I can&rsquo;t help worrying that she might get tired of me. After all, Kureha Senpai is popular, unlike me.</p>

<p>I understand how Senpai&rsquo;s mother feels, but since I don&rsquo;t have much confidence in keeping Senpai with me, I couldn&rsquo;t just nod along with the content of the letter.</p>

<p>Perhaps sensing my feelings, she let out a small complaint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, mom doesn&rsquo;t need to write such unnecessary things&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It just shows how much you&rsquo;re loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but I can&rsquo;t help worrying that it might pressure Takashi-kun, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t dislike Senpai when she teases me as usual, but I&rsquo;m no match for the mature aura she has right now.</p>

<p>Far from disliking her, it makes me feel like I have to try harder so that Senpai won&rsquo;t get tired of me.</p>

<p>In the end, I&rsquo;ve just fallen for Kureha Senpai even more.</p>

<p>I find myself getting thrilled over and over again by every little thing Senpai does. Maybe that&rsquo;s why Senpai doesn&rsquo;t stop teasing me.</p>

<p>Could it be that my lack of resentment towards Senpai&rsquo;s teasing is simply because I like her so much?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s put an end to this gloomy talk&#8230; Let&rsquo;s have some drinks!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Aren&rsquo;t you switching too quickly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m lost in thought, Senpai claps her hands vigorously.</p>

<p>The mature Senpai from a moment ago is nowhere to be found. She places two big bags at the end of the living room and sits down on the three-seater sofa.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s back to her usual, familiar, slouchy posture.</p>

<p>I wish I could get back the heart-pounding feeling I had for Senpai just a moment ago.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m thinking this, Senpai asks me a question with a sly grin forming at her lips.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh? You want to keep things serious? You don&rsquo;t want to get lovey-dovey with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I take a good look at Senpai&rsquo;s lips, I see they&rsquo;re glossed with lipstick, matching her leather jacket. Noticing that, I can&rsquo;t help but recall the sensation of our first kiss.</p>

<p>Soft and tender, yet slightly moist as we parted lips&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course, my feelings for Senpai aren&rsquo;t so light that they&rsquo;d end with just a kiss. I found myself wanting to go beyond the softness and the moisture, and after Senpai left, I spent my time in restless longing.</p>

<p>And even now, I have a strong desire to feel and to seek Senpai out.</p>

<p>If asked what lies at the core of these feelings, there was only one thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I want to be lovey-dovey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d say something like that, you naughty boy~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not naughty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll continue where that kiss left off if you admit you&rsquo;re naughty~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am naughty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yep yep, I like the honest Takashi-kun best~&rdquo;</p>

<p> Whether Senpai is being mature or just lazing around, my heart is constantly being swayed. And the fact that I find comfort in this makes me beyond help.</p>

<p>Plus, there&rsquo;s the incident with the erotic magazine. It&rsquo;s too late to try to cover that up now.</p>

<p>If she&rsquo;s offering to continue where the kiss left off, all the more reason to&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Why are you staring at my lips so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lips might get burned by your intense gaze, Takashi-kun. I can&rsquo;t help but notice~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hate it being looked at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you were looking! You&rsquo;re naughty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll just continue to live my days being shaken by Senpai.</p>

<p>Morning, noon, and night, and even while I&rsquo;m sleeping&#8230;</p>

<p>I must be thoroughly captivated by Senpai, thinking that even this is charming. She has dominated my heart completely, my gaze, and even my innocence.</p>

<p>Despite my heart being in turmoil, I sit next to Senpai. My heart is pounding, even though she hasn&rsquo;t done anything I desire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Takashi-kun, what would you like to drink? I&rsquo;ve brought a variety from sweet to bitter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; something sweet&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, a sweet kiss is what you wish for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While being enchanted by the sweet scent of her perfume, I maintain my composure as I continue the conversation.</p>

<p>Her mature attire, the pleasant atmosphere, and her sweet scent could melt my brain if I got too close.</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want a sweet kiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as your answer~&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, Senpai&rsquo;s mischievous smile is the final blow.</p>

<p>My heart is completely melted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, maybe I&rsquo;ll have something sweet too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying that, Senpai gets up from the sofa, takes a canned Chuhai from her large bag, and returns.</p>

<p>It was only a brief three-step movement, but even that made me feel lonely.</p>

<p>Even though I haven&rsquo;t had any alcohol yet, my vision is wavering. My heart is wavering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, to celebrate our living together, cheers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the clinking sound of our toast, I suppress the momentary wavering by gulping down the sweet alcohol.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, moving in with Senpai was too soon for me.</p>

<p>I asked myself as I continued to feel restless.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;m feeling the buzz from the alcohol, so maybe it&rsquo;s time to give Takashi-kun the sweet kiss he&rsquo;s been wanting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do it now? I&rsquo;m not mentally prepared yet&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? I&rsquo;ve been ready since we toasted. Does that mean you weren&rsquo;t into it, Takashi-kun? That&rsquo;s sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not like that. It&rsquo;s just that I can&rsquo;t imagine what a sweet kiss is supposed to be like, so I don&rsquo;t know how to prepare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what you&rsquo;re saying is you want me to teach you step by step?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a night in mid-October. My senior girlfriend had just arrived at my place with her moving boxes, and instead of sorting out her stuff, she started a party right away.</p>

<p> The sentimental senior who had been moved by her mother&rsquo;s letter was nowhere to be seen. Instead, as usual&mdash;or rather, more than usual&mdash;she was affectionately stirring my heart. And the sweet alcohol she brought, the &ldquo;Rich Peach Liquor,&rdquo; only accelerated that.</p>

<p>Her lips, painted with a seductive red lipstick, blended with the peach liquor, giving off a faint cherry blossom hue. The atmosphere shifted from mature to dangerously glossy, as if it was about to melt at any moment.</p>

<p>Just hearing the words &ldquo;sweet kiss&rdquo; from those lips made my tension skyrocket. It was already hard enough to calm my feelings, but with this, it was utterly impossible.</p>

<p>And then she had to add &ldquo;step by step&rdquo; to the mix, leaving me completely at her mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready? I&rsquo;ll teach you everything. We&rsquo;re going to do this many times from now on, so I need to teach you thoroughly, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your whispering tickles my ear&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ears are sensitive? That&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again, making fun of me&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I love all your reactions because they&rsquo;re so cute. I can&rsquo;t help but tease you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps I had built up some tolerance since this was my second time drinking, as I wasn&rsquo;t getting ahead of myself. However, being drunk made my senses more acute, and any breath on my ear would make me jolt in response.</p>

<p>Unable to hide how sharply attuned I was, I once again gave the kind of reaction my senior girlfriend loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my, oh my~? Your face has gotten even redder, hasn&rsquo;t it~? Are you blushing because someone said she loves you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a grin clearly brimming with joy, Kureha Senpai closes in on me as I sit at the end of a three-seater sofa. She presses her voluptuous body against me, inching closer and closer, clearly enjoying my reactions.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s the alcohol, but her physical affection is more intense than usual, and from time to time, I feel the sensation of her chest against my elbow. Her slender fingers are on my thigh.</p>

<p>Everything about Senpai, from her touch to her presence, is making my face turn red, and I can&rsquo;t even bear to look at the face of the person I adore so much.</p>

<p>And yet, Senpai won&rsquo;t even allow me to look away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>Everything about Senpai, from her touch to her presence, is making my face turn red, and I can&rsquo;t even bear to look at the face of the person I adore so much.</p>

<p>And yet, Senpai won&rsquo;t even allow me to look away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a no-no if you turn your face away. You&rsquo;ll miss out on a sweet kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a mischievous smile, nor is it an adult&rsquo;s feigned laughter. It&rsquo;s a bewitching smile filled with affection.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I had responded softly to such an expression from Senpai.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hehe, you&rsquo;ve finally become honest. You&rsquo;re surprisingly a lot more handful than I thought you&rsquo;d be, you know~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you one to talk, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am~? If I don&rsquo;t tempt you strongly, you won&rsquo;t come along, you scaredy-cat~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the perfect time to push you down, huh~? &#8230;Or is it too late if I do it now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to take the initiative following Senpai&rsquo;s words, but with my heightened senses, a slight push on my stomach was all it took for her to turn the tables and pin me down instead.</p>

<p>She hit the nail on the head, overpowering me with strength, and with my inferior romantic experience, I couldn&rsquo;t win against Senpai in any aspect. I&rsquo;m filled with a sense of shame.</p>

<p>However, Senpai is not a demon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I don&rsquo;t intend to tease you so much today, so don&rsquo;t be so wary. Since it&rsquo;s the first night of us living together, I&rsquo;ll let you have a very sweet night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying this, Senpai brings the peach liquor she had been drinking to my lips.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is her way of rewarding me. Without any hesitation, I drank down Senpai&rsquo;s peach liquor.</p>

<p> &ldquo;There you go, well done~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai slowly stroked my head with a bewitching smile as if to tease me.</p>

<p>Unable to bear the anticipation, I found myself asking a question without thinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t call this a sweet kiss, would you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to believe that the sweet kiss I had been so eagerly awaiting, after being teased and tantalized, would end with just an indirect kiss through sharing a peach liquor.</p>

<p>I am powerless against her, inferior in love experience, and there&rsquo;s not a single thing I can best Senpai at. It&rsquo;s pathetic, but like anyone else, I have sexual desires.</p>

<p>My expectations have been raised, and it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have desires just because it might end with an indirect kiss.</p>

<p>In fact, when it comes to sexual desire, I might even be above average&#8230; But I don&rsquo;t have the courage to make a move on Senpai.</p>

<p>Especially since I don&rsquo;t yet have the courage to face Senpai&rsquo;s father, who is said to be strict.</p>

<p>As these thoughts were swirling in my head, Senpai replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. An indirect kiss is just the beginning. It&rsquo;s something I do often with everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied as if I were satisfied.</p>

<p>Senpai is popular without me having to say it. She&rsquo;s undeniably beautiful, friendly, considerate, and has a sexy allure that captivates everyone.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be surprising if she had her fun without me knowing. After all, Senpai is popular.</p>

<p>Even as I tried to convince myself of this, a sense of frustration welled up inside me. I resented myself for not being worthy of Senpai.</p>

<p> I could feel my face stiffening naturally, but it seemed my worries were unfounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, when I say I do it, I mean with my girlfriends, so don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m not doing anything that would make you jealous~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jealous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Saying this, Senpai stood up from the sofa and once again walked towards the pile of large bags.</p>

<p>Senpai might tease, but she rarely lies, especially not the kind of lie that would hurt me.</p>

<p>Besides, the day after my birthday, before that kiss, Senpai had shed tears over how our relationship would proceed, telling me to &ldquo;rest assured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, I have nothing more to say to Senpai, and there&rsquo;s no need for jealousy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just revel in the sweet kiss we shared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the thing we&rsquo;re about to do, I&rsquo;m seriously serious. I&rsquo;ve never done it with anyone before, so be careful, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sweet kiss that she had never even done it before. That only raises my expectations even more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I might not be able to hold back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what Senpai said, and I watched her come back with another round of drinks and a certain snack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Pocky?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a refill of rich peach liquor, she brought a box of the famous stick-shaped chocolate snack.</p>

<p>Humming a tune almost like a whistle, she returns to the couch where I&rsquo;m waiting, in high spirits.</p>

<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p>Alcohol, Pocky, and a sweet kiss. The conclusion that this is leading to seems pretty clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you talk about sweet kisses with alcohol, it&rsquo;s got to start with the Pocky game, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I feared, my bad feeling was spot on.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai licks her lips, now coated with the taste of peach liquor.</p>

<p>In front of such a Senpai, my restless feelings only accelerate.</p>

<p>Still, I try to maintain my composure and scheme to create a situation that isn&rsquo;t too advantageous for Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just learned about alcohol recently.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Shall I teach you everything, step by step?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;you don&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be strong. You can say, &lsquo;I want the too-cute Senpai who&rsquo;s played the Pocky game with anyone else before to teach me gently.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s okay to say that, you know~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;really, you don&rsquo;t need to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite Senpai&rsquo;s tantalizing verbal assault, I managed to keep my cool. Or at least, I&rsquo;m trying to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hesitated for a moment, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that my attempt to appear calm didn&rsquo;t fool Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must be your imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As usual, you&rsquo;re trying to cover up the weird parts. It&rsquo;s okay to be a little spoiled, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like that at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure, let&rsquo;s just say that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>No matter how hard I tried, Senpai saw right through me, but she didn&rsquo;t press the issue any further.</p>

<p>Instead, she took a Pocky stick out of the bag and held it out to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you go, bite the cookie end, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bite the chocolate end and wait, so take your time and nibble it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, she implied, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to kiss,&rdquo; and flashed a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>Even so, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation from Senpai, who continued to smile seductively.</p>

<p> I bit the Pocky and turned the other end towards Senpai under her intense gaze.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, she bit the chocolate side and chuckled, &ldquo;Hehe&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>True to her word, Kureha Senpai waited with the chocolate end in her mouth, her eyes holding the usual teasing air as I nibbled my way closer.</p>

<p>If I did nothing, I was sure she would tease me with, &ldquo;See, you really are a baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having come this far, and with just a little more to go before I could turn the tables on Senpai, I couldn&rsquo;t maintain my usual composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, mmm&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&#8230; nice and steady. Come here, Takashi-kun&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crunch&#8230; crunch, crunch&#8230; I nibbled the Pocky closer to Senpai&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>With each small step closer, Senpai slowly trails her hands along my arms. In response, I place my hands on her slender shoulders and firm waist. As she nibbles on the Pocky, her body trembles slightly with each bite.</p>

<p>Her lips, which begin to melt the chocolate with their warmth, are coated with a glossy sheen over the rich peach-flavored lipstick. The once bewitching lips transform into a lusciously sweet pair that I yearn to kiss.</p>

<p>The Pocky we&rsquo;ve been eating is now down to the chocolate-covered area. Just a little more, and I&rsquo;ll reach Senpai&rsquo;s enticing lips.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m moments away from the sweet kiss I&rsquo;ve longed for when suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Mmm, I think that&rsquo;s enough. Here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmhf!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s lips come at me swiftly, and I&rsquo;m helplessly drawn in.</p>

<p>The Pocky I was slowly savoring vanishes in an instant, replaced by Senpai&rsquo;s tongue, richly coated with chocolate and peach liquor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Se-Senpai&#8230; what is this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm? Of course, it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;sweet kiss.&rsquo; It was sweet, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai grins mischievously, a hint of chocolate at the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>A glimpse of sweetness is revealed, but lurking behind it is a devilish side, ready to drain every ounce of my spirit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m overwhelmed by the kiss. It&rsquo;s too sweet to entertain any other thoughts.</p>

<p>But for Senpai, this kiss is just a casual first round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn to be the chocolate side, Takashi-kun. Here, bite this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we still going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I don&rsquo;t hold back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no chance to linger in the afterglow of the kiss with Senpai, her eyes melted into a sultry gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you plenty of sweet kisses until I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With those words, she let me bite the chocolate side this time .</p>

<p>Naturally, it was Senpai&rsquo;s turn to nibble next. I couldn&rsquo;t escape even if I wanted to, as Senpai&rsquo;s hand, which had traveled up my arm to my neck, didn&rsquo;t allow it, and I was sweetly attacked by Senpai once again without any means to resist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; hnn&#8230; Maybe I should add a bit more sweetness&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second time was no different; in fact, she dipped the Pocky in peach liquor before taking it into her mouth to increase the sweetness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready&#8230; for another one?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Senpai&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;mmmffh!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want another sweet kiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai is really cunning. How could I possibly say no when those melting eyes are gazing at me?</p>

<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to touch those lips that glint mischievously?</p>

<p>Who could stop the intensified sweetness of her kisses?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating that my feelings are being weighed against a mere piece of sweet.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s natural, isn&rsquo;t it? There&rsquo;s no reason to refuse this.</p>

<p>I shake my head quietly, insisting on more sweet kisses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, I knew you&rsquo;d do that, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai says with a smile, and she starts nibbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmhm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweet, melting voice of my lover echoes through my brain via the Pocky.</p>

<p>The sound of the cookie being finely nibbled, the sound of the accumulated dough being swallowed, the sound of a dry mouth being moistened with saliva&#8230;</p>

<p>The information transmitted through the Pocky accelerates my heartbeat. I&rsquo;m eager to taste Senpai&rsquo;s sweetness quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, ah&#8230; mmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just the Pocky. There&rsquo;s something about Senpai herself, right in front of me, that&rsquo;s urging me on.</p>

<p>The finely crumbled cookie dough coated my lips, and from the slightly parted corners of my mouth, saliva oozed out lazily&#8230;</p>

<p>At the end of it all, the deep crimson hair swayed gently to and fro. I couldn&rsquo;t help but quicken my pulse at the sight of the sweaty nape of her neck peeking through the gaps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun&#8230; I love you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Me, too&#8230; I love you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usual exchange. A casual yet affirming ritual. And yet, at this moment, I feel an unusual sense of fulfillment.</p>

<p>Surely, it&rsquo;s because Senpai looks more beautiful than ever.</p>

<p>Senpai, who no one else sees&mdash;disheveled, full of openings, and smeared with love, just for me.</p>

<p>Senpai, unique and sweet, with the scent of intoxicating liquor. My Kureha Senpai, whom I have no intention of sharing with anyone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; Mmm~&#8230; Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kiss, held back until now, was exceptionally sweet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; Mmm&#8230; Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, let&rsquo;s calm down for a moment? You&rsquo;re getting a little too drunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want more&#8230; I want to melt away sweetly with Takashi-kun&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to, but if we keep going like this, we might do it while being drunk, so let&rsquo;s stop soaking in alcohol, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehh~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No &lsquo;ehh&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s it for the booze. I&rsquo;m confiscating it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since then, we&rsquo;ve repeated the Pocky game over and over again.</p>

<p>Seeking sweetness and savoring the special moments with a lover, we kissed again and again.</p>

<p>With each repetition, the peach flavor intensified, unmistakably indicating a rising alcohol content, and gradually even my thoughts began to melt away.</p>

<p>Despite the fear of the boundless peach flavor, I had no intention of stopping the Pocky game.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I found myself wanting to taste more and more of Senpai.</p>

<p>Surely Senpai must feel the same way.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, the part that&rsquo;s missing&#8230; Takashi-kun will make up for it&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you give me a kiss so sweet that I&rsquo;d be satisfied even without peach liquor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gulp.</p>

<p>The melted expression, the saliva dripping slowly, the softness felt through the leisure jacket&mdash;it&rsquo;s impossible not to swallow my saliva at that.</p>

<p>Her pleading look with those upturned eyes was that stimulating.</p>

<p>Naturally, it gets me in the mood. I want to live up to Senpai&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Alright, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hyah&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure Senpai is satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pull her closer. I tighten my arm around her waist to bring our bodies even closer together.</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s body jolts, and a sweet voice escapes her lips.</p>

<p>Unable to resist, I caress her damp neck with my other hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; hhngh! Takashi-kun, don&rsquo;t tease me&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mm, uh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll continue, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, she&rsquo;s so cute. She wriggles her body, but she doesn&rsquo;t refuse outright.</p>

<p>Even though she utters words of protest as if in lament, her eyes plead for more.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m at my limit with Senpai, who is so endearing yet her actions and true feelings are completely mismatched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun&#8230; I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you too. I&rsquo;m seriously in love with you, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; &rdquo;</p>

<p>From the neck to the throat, along the jaw, and to the lips. As the saliva dripped down, I gathered it with my fingers and brought them closer to my true desire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;re so mean&#8230; I thought you&rsquo;d be more aggressive&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai, you&rsquo;re always mean to me too. So, this is payback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you seem to enjoy it, Takashi-kun. That&rsquo;s why I do it, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Kureha Senpai, seem very happy right now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, because&#8230; I&rsquo;m happy with anything Takashi-kun does to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, you&rsquo;re blushing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do? It&rsquo;s only natural to blush when Senpai says something like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like you, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just a little more.</p>

<p>Just a little more and I could have seen that flustered expression. Even though I was teasing and poking at her lips, before I knew it, the tables had turned.</p>

<p>No matter how much I struggle, I&rsquo;ll always be teased by Senpai. And I&rsquo;ll continue to find joy in it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to change. In fact, I&rsquo;m fine with the way things are. As long as Kureha Senpai stays by my side, that&rsquo;s more than enough.</p>

<p>But now&#8230; just for now, I want to go a little further&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha Senpai, can you hold on just a little longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm? Are you going to do something else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I said I&rsquo;d satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8213;&#8213;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p> She must have been caught off guard. She thought she had me figured out and was satisfied. But as my face rapidly approached hers, a look of surprise appeared on Senpai&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm!? Mm, mmm&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I let out just a little bit of my desire.</p>

<p>It was just a kiss, but still a kiss. For me, who hadn&rsquo;t been able to kiss a lover until turning twenty, it was a significant step forward.</p>

<p>But I should stop here. If I go any further, I won&rsquo;t be able to control myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, all I can do right now is stop at kissing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah&#8230; hah&#8230;! Mm&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Takashi-kun is in the mood, then I too&mdash;Mmhm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No matter how much Senpai desires it&#8230; it&rsquo;s just kissing&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lips are all sticky~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what happens when you play the Pocky game all day&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the end, I kept kissing Senpai until the Pocky was gone, and before I knew it, we continued kissing even after we ran out of Pocky.</p>

<p> We greedily tasted each other&rsquo;s sweetness-coated tongues, and when that wasn&rsquo;t enough, we entwined our bodies and kissed&#8230;</p>

<p>The kissing finally stopped just before sunrise. We hadn&rsquo;t spent the night packing up stuff; instead, we just cuddled on the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should we skip college classes tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you okay with your attendance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always attend classes seriously. What about you, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take them seriously too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you should be fine with skipping just for a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mouth was still tinged with chocolate, peach liqueur, and the sweet saliva of my beloved.</p>

<p>Reluctant to wipe away the lingering aftertaste, I made the choice to skip class for the first time.</p>

<p>Strangely, I didn&rsquo;t feel bad about it; on the contrary, I felt like I could say things I normally wouldn&rsquo;t dare to.</p>

<p>Seeing a chance to change the me who only ever thought these things in my head, I gathered my courage and voiced the thought that came to mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Since we&rsquo;re here, why don&rsquo;t we sleep together in bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that an invitation for something naughty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no&#8230; I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just kidding, just kidding. Let&rsquo;s lie down together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so bad for my heart, you know&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai and I, embracing each other on the sofa, let ourselves fall into the bed in the next room.</p>

<p>And then, we closed our eyes as if sinking into the depths.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, I confirmed the presence of my beloved Kureha Senpai before me.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p> On the second day of living together, I learned to skip class.</p>

<p>While everyone else was diligently attending their lessons, I was lying in the same bed with the lover I had kissed all night.</p>

<p>The lingering sweetness in my mouth stirred a faint restlessness in my heart. The fact that I didn&rsquo;t mind it was probably because I was too happy in the moment.</p>

<p>I wanted to believe that this happiness would become my &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; life.</p>
