<h2>Chapter 3: Wanting to Be Lovey-Dovey After a Day at University</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Alright! Cleaning complete!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ended up taking quite a bit of time, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we got to be all lovey-dovey because of it, so it&rsquo;s fine. You enjoyed it too, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Th-that&rsquo;s true, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the third day since Senpai had come to my room, and it was around noon when we finally finished organizing her belongings.</p>

<p>I leaned back on the three-seater sofa that was becoming our usual spot.</p>

<p>The reason it took three days to finish what should have been a day&rsquo;s work was simple: Senpai kept teasing me every chance she got, making it impossible to get any real work done.</p>

<p> The first day was lost to alcohol and kisses, and we slept soundly in bed until the next afternoon.</p>

<p>That much was unavoidable, but when Senpai started putting her clothes into the empty spaces in my dresser and teasing me, progress halted completely.</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t just any teasing that Kureha Senpai was doing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, this might give away that I&rsquo;m wearing my sexy underwear~&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every so often, she&rsquo;d do something that was bad for my heart, making it impossible not to stop working. And if I didn&rsquo;t stop, there was no telling what more provocative teasing Senpai might unleash.</p>

<p>Well, in the end, it wasn&rsquo;t just once but two or three times that I succumbed to her&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, do you want to see it instead&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes she&rsquo;d even shake her slightly short skirt as if she was about to lift it up.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t react to just the underwear talk, but the skirt lifting was a different story, and it satisfied Senpai&rsquo;s desire to tease.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t see under the skirt, and Senpai called me a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; to my face. Strangely enough, I didn&rsquo;t entirely dislike being called a &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; with her mischievous smile.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was filled with restless emotions and couldn&rsquo;t look Senpai in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t look away. Even if you&rsquo;re embarrassed, don&rsquo;t look away from me. We&rsquo;re living together now, so take a good look at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Senpai grasped my face with both hands, holding it in place.</p>

<p>When I looked into her eyes, they were so captivating that I wanted to look away again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My face is really red right now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai will probably tease me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t it be &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to tease&rsquo; instead&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai was always unwavering. No matter how much I tried to look away, or even if I confronted her like I did on the first night, Senpai was always fully committed to teasing me.</p>

<p>There was only one reason for that&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I love spending time teasing the person I love. Takashi-kun, don&rsquo;t you feel the same? Do you dislike being teased by me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because she loves it.</p>

<p>Whether that love is for the act of teasing itself or for me, I still don&rsquo;t know, but either way, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that I also love her. And her love is undoubtedly directed at me.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no way I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy that Senpai&rsquo;s feelings are for me, and my pent-up emotions turn into a grin on my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That way of putting it is a bit unfair&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I had let out a small complaint to Senpai.</p>

<p> Of course, there was no way Senpai would miss the perfect opportunity to tease me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Why&rsquo;s that~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be dating you if I didn&rsquo;t like it, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I want to hear it louder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that reaction?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I just want to see more of Takashi-kun&rsquo;s good points~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Senpai, who relentlessly shakes me up, is a lover who begs to see my good side.</p>

<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that there was another motive behind it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no reason for her to look at me with such expectant eyes, her cheeks relaxing into a smile.</p>

<p>Usually, it&rsquo;s just her mouth that smiles, but this time, even her cheeks are softening. It&rsquo;s a different kind of teasing, and at first, I didn&rsquo;t understand why it was different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good points you&rsquo;re talking about&#8230; Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, on second thought, there was one thing that came to mind. It wouldn&rsquo;t be an exaggeration to say it was a recent development.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why it took me so long to realize it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excitement and anticipation&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>My &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; seemed to heighten Senpai&rsquo;s expectations.</p>

<p>Determined to exceed them, I mustered up my courage and tried once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t want to be teased, I wouldn&rsquo;t agree&#8230; to live together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scent of sweet perfume grew stronger when I put my feelings into words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nnnngh!! I love you, Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I love you too&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could say more, Senpai pulled me into an embrace and whispered sweet nothings into my ear.</p>

<p>I tried to return the affection, but she easily accepted it.</p>

<p>It seemed it would take some time before I could get ahead of Senpai.</p>

<p>As I was held by Senpai, I caught a glimpse of the current time.</p>

<p> 1:30 PM. For university students, it&rsquo;s a crucial time that signals the start of afternoon classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oops, we can&rsquo;t stay like this forever. I&rsquo;ve missed school and need to catch up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought we&rsquo;d end up skipping three days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your friends have been covering for you, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but they&rsquo;re definitely going to probe into what I was doing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just tell them you were being lovey-dovey with your older, beautiful girlfriend~ I think that would be fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d definitely get beaten up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the past three days since the first night I slept in the same bed with Senpai, I had been skipping university classes.</p>

<p>Whether it was Senpai not letting me go to university or me not wanting to be apart from Senpai, various reasons led to my continued absence.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Of course, as a university student, skipping too much is problematic, and indeed, the friend I&rsquo;d asked to cover for me had been threatening me with &ldquo;You owe me more and more. You know that, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even without this incident, I owed that friend for various things, so I couldn&rsquo;t afford to skip any more classes.</p>

<p>For instance, the fake wall behind the bed the other time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Well, I guess I have no choice but to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Takashi-kun!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s none of your business!? You&rsquo;re going to university with me, Senpai!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh~?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;Eh~?&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pulled up my reluctant Senpai, and despite being late, we headed to the afternoon classes, hand in hand, making our way to the entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve already sent a message to my friend saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be busy flirting with my younger, handsome boyfriend, so please cover for me~.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a bit too strong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While chuckling wryly, I wondered how serious the content of Senpai&rsquo;s message was.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you finally show up, you truant. I was thinking of letting you treat me to yakiniku today after covering for you again, but thanks to you, that plan&rsquo;s gone out of the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was close. Yuu&rsquo;s appetite is seriously no joke&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I was actually planning on something other than all-you-can-eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seriously dangerous!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived at the university, I was being scolded by my best friend who had been in the classroom attending the lecture before me.</p>

<p>The reason was clear; it was a tacit way of saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been skipping too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p> No matter how much freedom a university student has to attend or skip classes, there&rsquo;s a limit to how much I can rely on others. And today was the last day of that limit.</p>

<p>Next to such a friend called Sonoda Yuu, I set out my notebook and writing utensils on the desk beside my reliable female friend, determined to listen to the lecture, even if it was partway through.</p>

<p>Contrary to the tomboyish manner of speaking, she was petite, and her oversized hoodie, based in blue and white, was perhaps the only thing that emphasized this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, why did you skip for three days? Depending on the reason, I might let you off the hook. Specifically, I might forgive you if you treat me to desserts in the cafeteria until I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like being forgiven at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just spit it out. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll force you to treat me to yakiniku.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll say it. I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you understand, then good. Go ahead, let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that Yuu had no intention of letting me attend the lecture properly, as she kept tugging at my sleeve, eager to find out what I had been doing for the past three days. And of course, it was under the assumption that I would be treating her to a meal.</p>

<p>As usual, she was hiding her face deep under the hood of her black hoodie, making her expression unreadable, but I was sure she was smirking to herself.</p>

<p> Like Kureha Senpai, it seems that I&rsquo;m easily teased by women.</p>

<p>Or perhaps I have some sort of fate with women who like to tease people?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>While pondering my situation, I recalled my current balance.</p>

<p>Roughly five thousand yen. Considering Yuu&rsquo;s deceptive appearance and her voracious appetite, treating her to desserts or yakiniku would stretch my modest funds.</p>

<p>Yet, not answering was not an option. Yuu would choose yakiniku without hesitation. And not just any yakiniku, but the expensive kind.</p>

<p>In a situation where escape was not permitted, I muttered my answer.</p>

<p> &ldquo;&#8230;I skipped because I wanted to be lovey-dovey with Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re going to the ATM later. You&rsquo;re treating me to yakiniku with your money.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just forgive me with a dessert?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said it depends on the reason, didn&rsquo;t I? What&rsquo;s this? I&rsquo;ve been exploited just so you could be lovey-dovey with your lover!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So unreasonable. I had simply answered honestly.</p>

<p>Even if I had lied, she would have opted for yakiniku.</p>

<p>Sonoda Yuu, my friend who detests lies, had cornered me, and it was truly unreasonable.</p>

<p>There was no escape.</p>

<p>But it can&rsquo;t be helped. Wanting to be lovey-dovey with Kureha Senpai is my true desire.</p>

<p>My best friend is that kind of person. She hates lies, is honest with her appetite, and on top of that, she has sharp intuition.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a person you can&rsquo;t let your guard down around, and she&rsquo;s different from Kureha Senpai in that respect.</p>

<p>However, even though I thought this, the fact that I had been lovey-dovey didn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p>So, I frantically threw out an excuse to Yuu in an attempt to protect myself even a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I couldn&rsquo;t help it! Kureha Senpai suddenly showed up at my place with her stuff, saying she was moving in!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that was a mistake.</p>

<p>The situation wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten worse if I hadn&rsquo;t said anything unnecessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about suddenly showing up with her stuff and moving in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like it sounds, I&rsquo;m currently living with Senpai in my room&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s because I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Yuu&rsquo;s voice gradually became heavier as I spoke with my usual tone.</p>

<p>At that moment, I was not only oblivious to this change but also completely unaware of the reason behind it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Takashi, as usual, you got overwhelmed and just went along with it? You&rsquo;re always so weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I was overwhelmed or anything&#8230; I&rsquo;ve always thought about wanting to spend more time with Kureha Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Despite that, you&rsquo;re always being teased. Even now, isn&rsquo;t this just going to end up being a joke where it turns out to be just a sleepover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai isn&rsquo;t the type to play that kind of jokes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was too busy explaining the living situation with Kureha Senpai to notice the shift in Yuu&rsquo;s tone.</p>

<p>In fact, I was getting heated up because I felt like Kureha Senpai was being ridiculed.</p>

<p>Senpai truly likes me.</p>

<p>After spending three days together, I understood that painfully well.</p>

<p>Even if it was my best friend Yuu, I couldn&rsquo;t forgive her for dismissing our living situation as a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; without really understanding.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I raised my voice a bit more than I intended.</p>

<p>Naturally, most of the people in the classroom started looking at me and began to murmur.</p>

<p>However, Yuu and I continued our conversation without caring about the surrounding gazes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, do you have any proof that you&rsquo;re really living together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-Of course!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? Then let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We glared at each other, neither of us backing down.</p>

<p>To end this standoff, I blurted out the proof that our living together wasn&rsquo;t a joke or prank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We kissed all night, and I slept in the same bed as Kureha Senpai&#8230;!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant, the classroom was filled with a murderous atmosphere.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Huh? Kureha Senpai, as in Ootani Kureha Senpai from the Faculty of Liberal Arts? What&rsquo;s he talking about, sleeping together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way, that&rsquo;s just wishful thinking. If that&rsquo;s the case, then I&rsquo;m being held by Ootani Senpai in my sleep every night too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, guys, there&rsquo;s also the theory that it&rsquo;s a hug pillow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What are they talking about, that should be my line.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m not one to talk since I&rsquo;m the one who declared we slept together, but still, this is quite an accusation.</p>

<p>No, rather, it&rsquo;s extremely creepy to think that my girlfriend has been turned into a hug pillow without my knowledge.</p>

<p>What do they mean by &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!!!&rdquo;?</p>

<p>&#8230;No, I knew it. I was well aware of how popular Senpai was and how she was often viewed by others.</p>

<p>Those words implied I was out of my league. The vile speculation that one could make Senpai theirs with just one night.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too late now. The fact that Kureha Senpai and I are dating and causing a stir might not matter anymore.</p>

<p>Even so, the possibility of Senpai and I breaking up is something that could never happen.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Alright, quiet down! Save the chit-chat for after class!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor&rsquo;s reprimand immediately silenced the murderous intent.</p>

<p>At the same time, a slight peace returned.</p>

<p>At least, nothing else will happen as long as the class continues.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The restaurant was bustling with people, a common sight as Yuu and I found ourselves amidst the crowd.</p>

<p>It was evening, just after classes had ended, and being close to the university, the place was lively with students.</p>

<p>No sooner had we taken our seats than I felt compelled to apologize to Yuu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, no need to apologize. I share the blame for angering you during class, Takashi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu replied while fiddling with her nails and hiding her expression under the deep hood of her black hoodie as usual.</p>

<p>It was hard to decipher what Yuu was truly thinking, but one thing was clear&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t lie.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t in her nature to tolerate dishonesty, not from herself or anyone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re not mad then&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I&rsquo;m not so terrible as to blame Takashi entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as I peered into Yuu&rsquo;s face, I saw no signs of anger.</p>

<p>Instead, her expression was one of a food lover eagerly anticipating the meal, her mouth relaxing into a smile at the thought of what was to come.</p>

<p>It was hard not to be exasperated by my friend, whose words and expressions seemed so mismatched.</p>

<p> I mean, come on.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Why are we at a yakiniku restaurant&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reason for us to be here if she wasn&rsquo;t upset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa there, it&rsquo;s not just any yakiniku place. It&rsquo;s a yakiniku izakaya. The drinks here are delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still yakiniku!! I told you the truth, didn&rsquo;t I!? I thought we agreed on just having dessert!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said it depended on what you told me, right? If you had said &lsquo;we slept together&rsquo;, then it&rsquo;s only fair I get yakiniku as compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unreasonable&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh at Yuu&rsquo;s eager correction.</p>

<p>Given the current situation, the minor difference between a yakiniku restaurant and a yakiniku izakaya was the least of my concerns.</p>

<p>True, she hadn&rsquo;t promised dessert if I told the truth. It was more like, &ldquo;I might let you off with just dessert,&rdquo; or something along those lines.</p>

<p>But still. Still! I wished she would consider the emotional toll I&rsquo;d suffered.</p>

<p>During class, I was interrogated provocatively, drawing the attention of other students, and even the professor advised me, &ldquo;Right now, focus on your studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to endure a lecture from the professor after class&#8230;</p>

<p>And now, yakiniku on top of all that. If this isn&rsquo;t unreasonable, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

<p>Yet, even as I made a sour face, Yuu&rsquo;s hunger remained unchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t complain so much. For all the trouble I&rsquo;ve caused you, the all-you-can-eat meal is enough compensation for what you owe me these past few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All-you-can-eat as compensation&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, and it includes all-you-can-drink too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a problem with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Great. Then let&rsquo;s start ordering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite my feeble resistance, Yuu reached for the order panel beside the table and began selecting drinks and meats one after another&mdash;kalbi, tan salt, horumon, liver.</p>

<p>She chose a variety of standard and more adventurous options to her heart&rsquo;s content. Naturally, the drinks were alcoholic.</p>

<p>Though petite, Yuu&rsquo;s birthday came earlier than mine, and while she couldn&rsquo;t drink as much as Kureha-senpai, she could handle a fair amount. So, I thought it was a good thing that she could drink and eat as much as she wanted.</p>

<p>In fact, I had never seen her drunk, no matter how much she drank, which was surprising in itself.</p>

<p>As I thought about my best friend&rsquo;s dining preferences, the dishes we ordered started arriving one after another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s grill &rsquo;em up~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can eat liver and horumon, right? If not, I can order something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I can eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu didn&rsquo;t hesitate to place the meat on the grill as it arrived.</p>

<p>The waitress who brought over the large number of plates was visibly surprised by her actions.</p>

<p>It was understandable. The amount we ordered was not typical for just two people, and that was true even when the first round of beers arrived for us.</p>

<p>Well, yeah. If you go by looks alone, Yuu doesn&rsquo;t really seem like an adult.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten used to each other, so it&rsquo;s not something I think about much anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, do you have any proof that you&rsquo;re really living together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-Of course!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? Then let&rsquo;s hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We glared at each other, neither of us backing down.</p>

<p>To end this standoff, I blurted out the proof that our living together wasn&rsquo;t a joke or prank.</p>

<p>And now, yakiniku on top of all that. If this isn&rsquo;t unreasonable, I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

<p>Yet, even as I made a sour face, Yuu&rsquo;s hunger remained unchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t complain so much. For all the trouble I&rsquo;ve caused you, the all-you-can-eat meal is enough compensation for what you owe me these past few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All-you-can-eat as compensation&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, and it includes all-you-can-drink too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a problem with that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Great. Then let&rsquo;s start ordering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite my feeble resistance, Yuu reached for the order panel beside the table and began selecting drinks and meats one after another&mdash;kalbi, tan salt, horumon, liver.</p>

<p>She chose a variety of standard and more adventurous options to her heart&rsquo;s content. Naturally, the drinks were alcoholic.</p>

<p>Though petite, Yuu&rsquo;s birthday came earlier than mine, and while she couldn&rsquo;t drink as much as Kureha-senpai, she could handle a fair amount. So, I thought it was a good thing that she could drink and eat as much as she wanted.</p>

<p>In fact, I had never seen her drunk, no matter how much she drank, which was surprising in itself.</p>

<p>As I thought about my best friend&rsquo;s dining preferences, the dishes we ordered started arriving one after another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s grill &rsquo;em up~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can eat liver and horumon, right? If not, I can order something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I can eat them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yuu didn&rsquo;t hesitate to place the meat on the grill as it arrived.</p>

<p>The waitress who brought over the large number of plates was visibly surprised by her actions.</p>

<p>It was understandable. The amount we ordered was not typical for just two people, and that was true even when the first round of beers arrived for us.</p>

<p>Well, yeah. If you go by looks alone, Yuu doesn&rsquo;t really seem like an adult.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve gotten used to each other, so it&rsquo;s not something I think about much anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you should endure because I&rsquo;ll just stick close like this for today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Endure? I mean, isn&rsquo;t this the usual?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely different because I won&rsquo;t kiss you even if I&rsquo;m feeling frisky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could this actually be an opportunity to be thoroughly lovey-dovey with Senpai?</p>

<p>While entertaining such sweet thoughts, I began to support Senpai.</p>

<p>**</p>

<p> &ldquo;Senpai&#8230;isn&rsquo;t this going a bit too far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Do you think you have the right to refuse, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;No, nevermind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was being punished for having eaten yakiniku and drunk alcohol with my best friend Yuu without telling Senpai.</p>

<p>A unique punishment from my lover: being excessively close to me without kissing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehehe, you can only be so composed for now~? And while I won&rsquo;t kiss you, I&rsquo;m willing to do other things~? What will you do? Shall we try something from that naughty book we read the other time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could enjoy this as much as I want! Besides, are you sure you&rsquo;ll be okay when you want to kiss, Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not completely confident I can resist, but I&rsquo;ll try to endure it if it means I can punish you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels more like a reward, actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As usual, Kureha Senpai and I continued our exchange on the sofa.</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly the same as usual since we were in the middle of a punishment.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai was more devilish and assertive than ever.</p>

<p> Despite saying she wouldn&rsquo;t kiss and wasn&rsquo;t sure she could resist, Senpai&rsquo;s expression seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>Her lips, still tinged with the aftertaste of citrues liquor, made the moment even more thrilling than I had imagined, making my heart race many times over.</p>

<p>Moreover, she pressed her body against my arms, chest, sides, and thighs as if to say &ldquo;take this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With each contact, I felt Senpai&rsquo;s scent even more strongly.</p>

<p>Is this really a punishment?</p>

<p>It seems more like a reward?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a melted gaze, Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s lips curved into a smile. Ah, she must know.</p>

<p>She must have seen through the fact that I&rsquo;m thrilled by her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how long you can keep calling it a reward~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it forever! After all, I can be with you as much as I want, Senpai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>I truly thought of it as a reward, and my desire to be with Senpai as much as possible was genuine.</p>

<p>I wanted to stay embraced like this forever.</p>

<p>But Senpai&rsquo;s actions were beyond my expectations.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well then, for starters&#8230; let&rsquo;s try this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She grabbed my right wrist and, before I knew it, pulled it under her clothes, sandwiching it between something warm and soft.</p>

<p>For a moment, I didn&rsquo;t understand what Senpai had done. She had thrust my hand under her clothes and sandwiched it between a warm, soft &ldquo;something,&rdquo; leaving me wondering what she wanted to do.</p>

<p>But once I saw the scene before me, I couldn&rsquo;t help but realize what Senpai wanted to do and what Senpai was currently doing to me.</p>

<p> I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the fact that Senpai was enveloping my right arm with her chest directly beneath her clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Kureha Senpai! My hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding it there. Why? You like it, don&rsquo;t you? Having your wrist wrapped up in my chest like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about liking or anything like that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it anymore if you don&rsquo;t tell me the truth~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Realizing that anything I hid from Senpai would eventually be uncovered, I easily confessed that the current situation was blissful.</p>

<p>Rather, I couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of this moment ending.</p>

<p>Today, Senpai was wearing the same shirt and denim shorts she wore on my birthday.</p>

<p>As usual, the loose top matched the relaxed atmosphere she always showed me.</p>

<p>The shorts below only emphasized Senpai&rsquo;s already strong appeal.</p>

<p>As a result, I surrendered myself to her.</p>

<p>I experienced a spectacular view with my eyes, Senpai&rsquo;s sweet scent with my nose, Senpai&rsquo;s softness with my right hand, and the closeness to Senpai with my entire body. I&rsquo;m feeling so happy that my brain seemed to melt.</p>

<p>Among the erotic magazines that Senpai allowed me to keep, there were certainly ones that involved hands being trapped between breasts and various other activities. And I had fantasized about replacing the characters with Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>However, I never had the courage to act on it. I thought that even if I did, I would just be teased and that would be the end of it&mdash;until the day Senpai and I first kissed.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why the fact that my fantasies were becoming a reality was nothing but happiness, and the fact that Kureha Senpai was willingly doing it for me only amplified that happiness.</p>

<p>Of course, I had no idea that this was merely the prologue for Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, who loves to tease and delay gratification and who can still evoke the taste of that rich peach liquor with just a memory of her intense kiss, would never be satisfied with just &ldquo;trapping my arm with her chest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if you asked me if I could imagine what would come next, the answer would be no.</p>

<p>Because, you know?</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hehe, it&rsquo;s good to be honest. So, next is&#8230; maybe this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was completely caught by surprise, just as Senpai had planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, maybe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she murmured, Senpai picked up a half-drunk bottle of citrus liquor.</p>

<p>The rich citrus scent mingled with Senpai&rsquo;s fragrance, creating an almost sensual aroma.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai, without any concern for the white T-shirt she was wearing, let a drop of the citrus liquor fall onto my right hand, aimed right at my index finger.</p>

<p>Far from being concerned, Senpai began to lick my index finger, where the citrus liquor had fallen, without hesitation.</p>

<p>She licked my finger thoroughly, savoring the remaining citrus liquor while lasciviously flicking her tongue in a way that was almost a show for me.</p>

[img]

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>

<p> The person I love was persistently licking my finger, yet it seemed as if she was licking something entirely different.</p>

<p>As a result, I choked on my words as I tried to call out to her.</p>

<p>It was all because my arm was sticking out from between her chest.</p>

<p>I was replacing my arm with something else in my mind.</p>

<p>Surely, if she had just dripped liquor on my index finger normally, I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt it was sensual, nor would it have seemed like something else. Nor would I have felt this growing frustration&#8230;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Senpai&#8230; this is really a punishment, right&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, it&rsquo;s a punishment~? Making sure you, mmmhn&#8230; have a tough time~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from a punishment, I&rsquo;m only having a new happy experience&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then maybe a little more stimulation is necessary~&rdquo;</p>

<p>On my second attempt, I finally managed to voice my thoughts aloud, hurling my question at her as if to confirm.</p>

<p>The situation seemed so far removed from any form of punishment that I had to ask.</p>

<p>But even upon confirmation, Senpai&rsquo;s answer remained unchanged. She insisted that this was indeed a punishment.</p>

<p>My right index finger continued to be playfully swirled around by her tongue. As my surprise subsided, my senses sharpened, and I could feel every movement of Senpai&rsquo;s tongue relayed through my finger to my brain.</p>

<p>It was a sensation that transcended happiness, a stimulus to my unconscious desires.</p>

<p>However, at that moment, I was oblivious to this, intent on savoring the happy experience as if vowing not to let it slip away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nh&#8230; slurp, nnghh&#8230; mmm~, pfft. Hehehe&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230; Kureha Senpai&#8230;! This isn&rsquo;t a punishment&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm? If you can still talk, maybe the stimulation isn&rsquo;t enough? Maybe I should add more alcoho~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does it come to that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would suck on my fingertips, making a watery sound, and when that seemed insufficient, she would pour more citrus liquor onto them before lewdly sucking again.</p>

<p>Gradually, not only my fingertips but also the back of my hand and my entire arm became wet with citrus liquor and other fluids, yet Senpai seemed unconcerned. Even if her white T-shirt became stained, she showed an extraordinary fixation on my index finger.</p>

<p>No, perhaps the T-shirt didn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>

<p>Indeed, while she checked the state of my arms trapped beneath her, there was no sign that she cared about her T-shirt.</p>

<p>Instead, watching her now, I was reminded of the peach liquor and the Pocky game.</p>

<p>The fruit alcohol that kept being added without limit, and something that absorbed it.</p>

<p>Now, that something had simply shifted from Pocky to the T-shirt and my arm.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were tinged with a faint pink, perhaps from the warmth of her hair.</p>

<p>Her lips, too, were glossy with a reddish hue from the sake and saliva.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I wonder~? Takashi-kun, what do you thin about thisk~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I think? I&rsquo;ve said it many times, it&rsquo;s a reward&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re not holding back at all~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holding back&#8230; you said&#8230; me&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My enchanting lover&rsquo;s smile made me aware of the feelings that had been unconsciously accumulating.</p>

<p> These were natural feelings that could build up in the course of life, nothing out of the ordinary. And for a healthy man with sound thoughts, they were even more likely to accumulate.</p>

<p>In short, it was sexual desire.</p>

<p>Of course, it was obvious when I thought about it. How could I not be filled with restless thoughts when the person I cherished was looking at my finger with such desire, licking and sucking it persistently?</p>

<p> I wanted to be overwhelmed not just by a finger but by my entire body by my beloved Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>Those accumulated feelings began to transform into a longing.</p>

<p>But of course, I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten what Kureha Senpai had declared.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Looking back, that was quite a harsh condition.</p>

<p>For me, who hadn&rsquo;t done anything beyond kissing, this situation was nothing short of torture.</p>

<p>I wanted to push her down. I wanted to see Senpai&rsquo;s flustered face right now.</p>

<p>I wanted to relieve the feelings that had built up inside me, and a kiss would be the best way to do that.</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t have the courage to ask for more than that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why, at that moment, the only option left for me was to retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? What&rsquo;s wrong~~? You&rsquo;re blushing so much. Oh, but you&rsquo;ve been red since you hugged me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please save the teasing for later&#8230; I&rsquo;m serious right now&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look really troubled~. What&rsquo;s wrong~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the concern in her voice, Kureha Senpai was grinning.</p>

<p>It was as if she fully understood the situation.</p>

<p>Yet, what I had to do remained unchanged. I couldn&rsquo;t think of any other way out but this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, I need to use the restroom&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, is that so? Need to go to the restroom, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230; so, could we maybe postpone the punishment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it really the restroom you need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;I never imagined that even the excuse of going to the restroom would be blocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, what do you mean by that&#8230;? Asking if it&rsquo;s really the restroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I tried to stand up from the sofa, pulling my right arm away from Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s chest, which was soaked with alcohol and her saliva, her casual remark made me sit back down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it really the restroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a casual question from Senpai. Under normal circumstances, such a question would be answered with a simple &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the restroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t give that answer now. To do so would be to tell a lie.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to lie, and even if I did, Senpai would surely see through it immediately.</p>

<p>However, revealing the truth was also difficult. It would mean admitting that my desire was building up.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere, I sat back down on the sofa and observed Senpai&rsquo;s demeanor.</p>

<p>My right hand was still faintly damp with the citrus liquor and Senpai&rsquo;s saliva.</p>

<p>Glancing over at Kureha Senpai to my left, I saw her usual vibrant red hair hiding a slightly mischievous expression.</p>

<p>Noticing my gaze, she deliberately acted with meaningful exaggeration.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, no, you see, this is just my intuition as a woman, or rather, as your girlfriend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really want to feel refreshed right now, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s guess was spot on, and her intuition was a direct hit.</p>

<p>As for me, I couldn&rsquo;t hide my agitation after being struck by the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve had a lot to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried desperately to mislead Senpai with gestures and words.</p>

<p> Of course, Kureha Senpai was not so easily swayed by such things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be drinks involved, but it feels a bit different? What do you think about that, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel anything out of the ordinary&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, maybe it&rsquo;s just something strange with you~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without focusing on my lower abdomen, which I had been consciously avoiding, Senpai tapped it as if to show it off, drawing my attention there.</p>

<p>It was boiling, and I felt so tense that I thought I might go mad.</p>

<p>Once my focus shifted there, there was no way I could pretend anymore.</p>

<p>My eyes wandered, unable to control the desire that was too loyal to its own needs, over Senpai&rsquo;s soft chest, her attractive abdomen, and her vulnerable thighs.</p>

<p>Not only was I continuously pressed against Senpai, but my arm had also been threaded through her chest, and to top it off, she had been playfully licking my fingers.</p>

<p> I had long since surpassed my limit.</p>

<p>Precisely because of that, the relentless teasing when one is fully aware can feel almost like overkill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? What&rsquo;s wrong, Takashi-kun? Are you so flustered? Could it be that you want to &lsquo;clear your mind&rsquo; ?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if I said I wanted to&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I almost took the bait of Senpai&rsquo;s obvious provocation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, what should I do? After all, you&rsquo;re the boyfriend who went out drinking with another girl~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s deliberately sticky and drawn-out way of speaking struck me painfully in the chest.</p>

<p>It was clear that what I had done today was something she disliked.</p>

<p>Was it the fact that I had dinner with someone of the opposite sex, or was it the drinking?</p>

<p>There are still things that aren&rsquo;t clear , but either way, it&rsquo;s true that I lacked consideration for Senpai.</p>

<p>The weight of Senpai&rsquo;s words bore down on me heavily.</p>

<p>Yet, Senpai pressed on relentlessly.</p>

<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Takashi-kun? Surely you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that you&rsquo;re being punished and now want to sneak off to the bathroom to &lsquo;clear your mind&rsquo; alone? To cast aside the sweet lovey-dovey time with your cute girlfriend and seek relief by yourself&#8230; you wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing, would you, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite her harsh words, there was a lonely look in the depths of Senpai&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t her usual aggressive expression but rather one that seemed to be seeking affection.</p>

<p>It was the same expression I saw the day after we discussed moving in together, the one full of affection when we first kissed.</p>

<p>Faced with such an expression, my resolve was inevitably set.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what will it be, Takashi-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll accept my punishment to the end. Until Senpai is satisfied, until you feel fulfilled, I won&rsquo;t run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I shouldn&rsquo;t do anything that would seem like running away from the fact that I had made Senpai sad.</p>

<p>The painful heat I felt in my lower abdomen was a result of making Senpai sad.</p>

<p>I decided to endure the pain until Senpai&rsquo;s anger subsided to the very end.</p>

<p>With that array of resolutions set in my heart, I sat back deeply into the sofa.</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai then snuggled up even closer&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Then I&rsquo;ll take you up on that offer&#8230; but I think I&rsquo;ll end the punishment here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expected continuation didn&rsquo;t come.</p>

<p>When I looked at Senpai, puzzled, there was my lover with her usual gentle smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little satisfied with your serious expression. Ah, Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;re really cool just now&#8230; So, the punishment is over! From now on, let&rsquo;s just enjoy our lovey-dovey time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean&#8230; you&rsquo;ve forgiven me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right~&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Kureha Senpai&rsquo;s smile and gesture, all the tension drained from my body.</p>

<p>Senpai had forgiven me. So, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel relieved.</p>

<p>At the same time, I vowed in the depths of my heart to never make Senpai sad again.</p>

<p>And as if to remind me of my thoughts, Senpai&rsquo;s stern words flew at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it won&rsquo;t be so easy next time, okay!? If you really must go out to eat with someone, you must let me know! If not, I&rsquo;ll give you a punishment that&rsquo;s even tougher than today&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you understand, then you can go to the bathroom. You&rsquo;re at your limit, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> Before I could even respond to the casual concern about my lower abdomen, I found myself sprinting to the toilet, shouting as I went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Really, I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to dislike you, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engrossed in my dash to the restroom, I failed to hear the words Senpai muttered under her breath.</p>

<p>After relieving myself and feeling better, I found it difficult to make eye contact with Senpai, especially after what had happened.</p>

<p>The image of Kureha Senpai kept coming to mind as I tried to clear my head.</p>
