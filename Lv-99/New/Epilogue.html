<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, how about we go on a little trip and stay overnight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An overnight trip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Sounds good, right? I&rsquo;ve already got everything ready!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without even asking me!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When faced with an important decision, it always comes suddenly, and yet, there&rsquo;s no time to think it over.</p>

<p>With her ever-present smile, Kureha-senpai is rolling a carry-on bag from the back room. All I can do is watch her as I wash the breakfast dishes.</p>

<p>Senpai looks especially cute today.</p>

<p> She&rsquo;s wearing a white knit sweater and jeans, impeccably dressed for going out. The denim clings tightly but can&rsquo;t fully contain her curves. Knowing all too well what lies beneath those curves, I can&rsquo;t help but feel my heart race.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not just her clothes that leave me searching for where to rest my eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking maybe Takashi-kun would say okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ehehe~. That&rsquo;s my Takashi-kun~. I looove you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those direct words catch me off guard. Even when I&rsquo;m prepared, even when I expect them, I&rsquo;m still incredibly weak to Senpai&rsquo;s sweet nothings.</p>

<p>Affection voiced through those slightly parted cherry-pink lips. Those soft lips that always tease me, then melt into a sweet kiss.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve stopped trying to think.</p>

<p>Last night, as I lay in bed, I thought about Senpai and Koutarou-san.</p>

<p>Should I just leave their quarrel alone?</p>

<p>Is it okay for the emotional distance between parent and child to remain? Should I leave everything to Senpai&rsquo;s mother, Haruka-san?</p>

<p>I pondered various things. I thought and thought until I woke up this morning, but all those thoughts vanished with Senpai&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, have you decided where we&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Izu? I was thinking that might be nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds good. It&rsquo;s close yet distant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plus, there are hot springs, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot springs&#8230;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you just imagined something naughty, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no&#8213;&#8213;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nfufu, what happens will be a surprise once we get to Izu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai seems to see right through my shallow thoughts.</p>

<p>Hot springs.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that word, I couldn&rsquo;t help but imagine Senpai soaking in the water. Her already smooth skin would be polished even further by the minerals in the water. And the unique sulfur scent of the hot springs mingling with Senpai&rsquo;s sweet fragrance..</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t stop my mind from wandering to such wicked thoughts.</p>

<p>But, of course, that&rsquo;s all put on hold. Senpai pointed out with her index finger that my mouth was hanging open foolishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, shall we get going to Izu right away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just like that, our spontaneous trip begins.</p>

<p>At that moment, I had no idea.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have known that this trip to Izu would become the catalyst for deepening the relationship between Senpai and me.</p>
