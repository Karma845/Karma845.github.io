<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm&#8230; Takashi-kun&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be so eager. I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. Really, Takashi-kun is so cute~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I like what I like&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh, is that so~&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart clenched with a surge of excitement.</p>

<p>Ah, I&rsquo;m so in love. Love, love, I love you so much.</p>

<p> He is so cool that it makes me hesitate to tease him, yet there&rsquo;s an adorable earnestness in how he continues to desire me.</p>

<p>My affection is overflowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Senpai? What&rsquo;s with wrapping your arms around my neck&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm? I just don&rsquo;t want to let go. Is that bad? If you don&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;ll stop right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that&#8230; Let&rsquo;s just stay like this&#8230; and kiss, shall we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, if Takashi-kun says so, I won&rsquo;t hold back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senpai!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call, my, name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kureha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, well done. Now, as a reward, I&rsquo;ll give you a kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My overflowing feelings manifested as desire.</p>

<p>I want to be more connected, to feel more passion, to have Takashi-kun call my name more.</p>

<p> More, and even more&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I want to fill his thoughts so completely with me that he has no time to think of anyone else.</p>
