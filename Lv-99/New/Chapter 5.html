<h2>Chapter 5: The Bathroom</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, what kind of person is this Yuu-chan we met at the bar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;What&rsquo;s gotten into you all of a sudden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, just a bit curious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the afternoon.</p>

<p>What I brought to my lips was Senpai&rsquo;s homemade shijimi miso soup.</p>

<p>As the effective shijimi extract for hangover relief seeped into both body and mind, I watched Kureha Senpai in a good mood.</p>

<p> My head was pounding, and my body was in terrible shape.</p>

<p>I had drunk too much, and my mood was down. Kureha Senpai, on the other hand, seemed unfazed despite having drunk just as much.</p>

<p>Unlike me, who had slept until noon, she had woken up as usual, finished her assignments, and even prepared lunch.</p>

<p>For some reason, Kureha Senpai was showing interest in Yuu.</p>

<p>They seemed to have had some sort of interaction at the bar, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember the details.</p>

<p>Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t even remember when I had come home.</p>

<p>Rather, it was only yesterday that I learned Yuu worked at the bar. And despite being in the middle of serving us, there was no sign of her taking off her hood.</p>

<p>Surely, as she said, she must be dedicated to working behind the counter.</p>

<p>When she approached us, she had a customer service-like tone, so it felt like she was properly doing her job. But as soon as she realized it was me, she switched to her usual tomboyish tone and seemed to irritate Kureha Senpai&#8230;</p>

<p>What does Senpai want to know about my best friend?</p>

<p>While feeling a slight unease, I watched Senpai, who then pressed on with a bit of a prickly tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what kind of person is she? You&rsquo;re close with her, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just university friends. Yuu is basically the only one I really hang out with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my, that&rsquo;s a bit lonely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except for the times I meet with Senpai, I would have had a lonely college life if Yuu hadn&rsquo;t spoken to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no intention of hiding anything in front of Senpai and conveyed everything as it was.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always felt that I don&rsquo;t mind Senpai knowing everything about me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuu is more like a male friend than someone of the opposite sex. Even the thing behind the bed, we assembled it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I might have said too much, but that&rsquo;s because it was in front of Senpai.</p>

<p>Somehow, I always end up inadvertently revealing more than I intend in front of Senpai.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done it now.</p>

<p>By the time I realized it, Senpai was almost always ready to tease.</p>

<p>This time was no exception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing behind the bed? You mean where you had all those naughty books hidden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;right&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong~? Your voice is so quiet~? Are you still worried about those naughty books~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The erotic books hidden behind the bed, which would have been forgotten if I hadn&rsquo;t said anything extra, and the schemes to hide them must have sparked something in Senpai.</p>

<p>Her teasing tone gradually returned to her usual mischievous one.</p>

<p>She must have forgotten until just now.</p>

<p> At first, her expression was gentle, as if she was confirming something. But she changed as soon as she saw me flustered.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I told you, didn&rsquo;t I~? I don&rsquo;t mind at all~. I like you, even the naughty side of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m particularly naughty&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you don&rsquo;t want to do it? You don&rsquo;t want to do naughty things with me? More than what we did yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a lie if I said I didn&rsquo;t want to&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do want to~?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha Senpai quickly brought the conversation to her own pace, and I was helplessly defeated.</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m told I&rsquo;m liked&#8230; if I&rsquo;m asked if I don&rsquo;t want to do something naughty, I can&rsquo;t help but feel inclined.</p>

<p>However, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the decision I made to wait until the time comes to not go beyond kissing&#8230; to not fulfill my true desires.</p>

<p>Yes, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten. But, but still&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I do want to, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, shall we do something naughty to sober up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Eh?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be strange not to feel inclined when your beloved lover suggests doing something naughty.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but send a heated gaze to the place where those words were spoken.</p>

<p>Naturally, Senpai has noticed. It&rsquo;s completely obvious. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s anything I can do about it.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to disguise my feelings for Senpai?</p>

<p>No matter what I try, Senpai looks at me with those penetrating eyes as if seeing right through me.</p>

<p>If I knew how to deceive her, I would certainly like to learn that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, you&rsquo;re staring at my lips so intently. It&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you teasing me again&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;What if I&rsquo;m serious and not teasing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not falling for that again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t just be teased all the time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought as I tried to shake off the teasing, and then I saw it&mdash;the erotic book that Senpai had left out, now spread open before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Senpai?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pick your favorite page. I&rsquo;ll do whatever&rsquo;s on it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand what Kureha Senpai was doing right now.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a punishment, but why was she offering something that felt more like a reward?</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend it. Of course, I was happier with a reward than a punishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to remind you that I&rsquo;m here, especially since you&rsquo;ve been bringing girls to your room without me knowing, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why does she turn jealousy into teasing instead of anger&#8230;</p>

<p>Even though we live together, I still know so little about Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, this page.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, maybe it&rsquo;s better that I don&rsquo;t know everything yet.</p>

<p>Because isn&rsquo;t that right?</p>

<p>So much more to learn about Senpai, which means there&rsquo;s so much more to love about her.</p>

<p>My love for her grows. With joy at the realization that my understanding of love is still immature, I follow Senpai&rsquo;s instructions, inserting my finger into the erotic book and pointing to the pages.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Here we are in the bathroom.</p>

<p>The occasional sound of water droplets pitter-pattering on the tiled floor echoes in the space.</p>

<p>If one speaks, the voice echoes as if we&rsquo;re in another realm.</p>

<p>In such a place, I&rsquo;m alone with Kureha Senpai, both of us in just bath towels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, just stay still, okay~? Sooner or later I&rsquo;ll show you, but I need to prepare myself mentally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No peeking at my breasts, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need to say that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mirror in front of us reflects everything without omission, including the figure of my lover wrapping a slightly damp bath towel around herself and moving behind me.</p>

<p>Thanks to the anti-fog coating, Senpai&rsquo;s unguarded figure is visible without even having to turn around.</p>

<p>Of course, my own tense and rigid self is also reflected&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sorry, it&rsquo;s just that Takashi-kun is so cute when he&rsquo;s embarrassed, your ears are all red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kureha-senpai peered over my shoulder. Her ears flushed red with tension as she whispered, &ldquo;Cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but twitch in response, much to Senpai&rsquo;s delight.</p>

<p>&#8230;How did it come to this?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go back to the living room.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Senpai was spreading an erotic magazine in front of my face.</p>

<p>Of course, it was one of the &lsquo;things that make me conscious of Senpai&rsquo; that she allowed me to have.</p>

<p> Whether it&rsquo;s due to a strong desire for self-expression or just insecurity, I can&rsquo;t tell, but one thing is certain: letting Yuu into my room had made Senpai feel uneasy.</p>

<p>I had no choice but to accept Senpai&rsquo;s desires.</p>

<p>Still, there remained a slight sense of resistance within me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, why can&rsquo;t I choose ?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if Takashi-kun chooses, you&rsquo;ll probably pick something modest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems Senpai has seen right through me.</p>

<p>I owe Senpai an apology, so it doesn&rsquo;t mean I can do &ldquo;anything.&rdquo; Either way, I can&rsquo;t control myself if I don&rsquo;t keep it modest. And even if I manage to keep control, there&rsquo;s no guarantee that Senpai won&rsquo;t stir things up.</p>

<p>At least right now, in this moment, my heart is already racing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s modest, I can&rsquo;t properly make you understand that I&rsquo;m your girlfriend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think Senpai should choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that would make it seem like I&rsquo;m the one who wants to do it, and that&rsquo;s a little embarrassing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand what embarrasses you, Senpai&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Takashi-kun, you need to re-acknowledge that I&rsquo;m your girlfriend! Got it!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In front of me was a beauty dressed provocatively.</p>

<p>If I shifted my gaze slightly from the magazine, I could see my beautiful girlfriend pouting.</p>

<p>In such a situation, I had to choose something from the erotic magazine for Senpai to do to me.</p>

<p>Of all things, it was a book that I had secretly enjoyed alone while thinking of Senpai.</p>

<p>How could this not be embarrassing?</p>

<p> Senpai had already mostly figured out what I did alone with the previous sorting of erotic books.</p>

<p> In other words, Senpai had a clear view of my tastes and preferences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop&#8230; here&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it was good luck or bad, we ended up on the &lsquo;Taking a Bath Together&rsquo; page, which brings us to the present.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll wash your back. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to tell me if it&rsquo;s itchy or painful, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s gentle voice echoed throughout the bathroom.</p>

<p>It was comforting to hear her voice as if my whole body was listening, but it also made me feel even more ashamed about what was to come.</p>

<p>If I turned around, I would see Kureha-senpai holding a sponge loaded with body soap, wearing nothing but a bath towel.</p>

<p>The humidity of the bathroom made the towel cling tightly to her body, forming a fan shape that I couldn&rsquo;t even look at directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still nervous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m nervous&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was too soon to bring you into the bath without a kiss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d be far beyond just nervous if you kissed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that make you feel all hot and bothered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, you&rsquo;re such a pervert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I felt the dryness in my mouth, Senpai&rsquo;s breath brushed against my ear, and with a voiceless scream, heat surged through my body.</p>

<p> Every casual remark from Senpai seemed to endlessly stoke the fires within me.</p>

<p>Even though I hadn&rsquo;t drunk any alcohol today, my head felt light and reality seemed distant.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because we were in the bathroom&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe, your ears are turning red again. You&rsquo;re so cute, Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Th-that&rsquo;s enough, please just wash my back already!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. Takashi-kun is such a shy boy, isn&rsquo;t he~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike me, who felt as if I was under the influence, Senpai was her usual self.</p>

<p>Yes, the usual teasing, slightly mean-spirited lover.</p>

<p>Yet, she was a little more daring. And that only made my feelings for her grow stronger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see you get even more embarrassed, so I&rsquo;m going to wash your back in a slightly different way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senpai&rsquo;s voice was in my ear, and on my back, I felt a softness different from a sponge. I immediately knew what it was.</p>

<p>There was no way I couldn&rsquo;t recognize it. It was the softness I had always felt with her arms and shoulders.</p>

<p> &ldquo;How is it? Does your back feel good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soft warmth on my back was different from the usual body sponge. It was a warmth I would never feel when washing alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes&#8230; it feels good&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mind was still in a haze, unable to think clearly, and I found myself honestly answering Senpai&rsquo;s questions without any pretense.</p>

<p>Hearing this, Senpai let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The sound of water droplets falling from the faucet mixed with Senpai&rsquo;s voice, her breaths, and her movements, all of which seemed incredibly sensual to me.</p>

<p> I should be controlling my heart with reason and keeping my composure, but my body was growing hotter in direct opposition.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p> &ldquo;Se-Senpai&#8230; isn&rsquo;t this going a bit too far&#8230;? It&rsquo;s more than just punishment&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, now you say that? It stopped being a punishment the moment we entered the bath together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a punishment&#8230;? Then, what is this&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious, isn&rsquo;t it&#8230; I just want to be close to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I let out another voiceless gasp at the words Kureha Senpai released after a slight pause.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. If I think about it, there&rsquo;s no penalty for this to be a punishment.</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s forbidding me to go to the bathroom like last time, nor is the teasing severe.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just more physical contact than usual. Just a closer distance.</p>

<p>The biggest proof is that Senpai is unusually honest.</p>

<p>This time can&rsquo;t be a punishment. By the time I realized that, the softness on my back had already spread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahahaha, you&rsquo;re startled~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-well of course I did!! Right now&#8230;you&rsquo;re not wearing anything!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I properly wrapped in a bath towel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just covering up? I doubt a single bath towel can really diminish the feeling&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takashi-kun, do you dislike it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I like it, but&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I like the softness feeling in general. I like it because it&rsquo;s Senpai&rsquo;s softness.</p>

<p>Feeling Senpai&rsquo;s breath close to my ear, I questioned myself.</p>

<p> Just a single bath towel. Yet, it&rsquo;s only one.</p>

<p>The thinness of a mere bath towel is ignorant of Senpai&rsquo;s softness that refuses to be contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine if you like it? Should I just take it off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way! I said I like it, but we still need to keep it moderate&#8230;! We&rsquo;re still students!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tries to remove the bath towel whenever there&rsquo;s a chance, without knowing how I feel. I really wish she would give me a break.</p>

<p>Rather, it&rsquo;s not just whenever there&rsquo;s a chance, but whenever there&rsquo;s &ldquo;like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though I said I like it, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay to do it.</p>

<p>If I were to feel Senpai&rsquo;s softness directly, our relationship would undoubtedly change.</p>

<p>To avoid such a situation, I had been content with erotic books, but inviting Yuu, my only friend, to hide those books has led to the current predicament.</p>

<p>What to do now?</p>

<p>I had a vague understanding of Senpai&rsquo;s jealousy over the yakiniku matter, but to experience her jealousy as this softness is quite characteristic of my relationship with Kureha Senpai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to be lovey-dovey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about &lsquo;but&rsquo;! At this rate, it won&rsquo;t just be lovey-dovey anymore!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When that time comes, it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;We have to make sure that time doesn&rsquo;t come!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trying to stop Senpai, who prioritizes impulses of the moment, is also typical of us.</p>

<p>However, words alone won&rsquo;t stop Senpai, and even now, a softness is still attacking my back.</p>

<p>While feeling her sultry breath in my ear, the softness assaulting me dulls my thoughts.</p>

<p>As my senses are thrown into disarray, it even makes me think it will be okay with being overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p> Every move Senpai makes is too fatal for me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just because we&rsquo;re in the bathroom right now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m hopelessly in love with Senpai. I&rsquo;ve fallen for her, and I&rsquo;ve even come to want to monopolize her.</p>

<p>I wonder how much others know about Senpai&rsquo;s sloppy yet charming side.</p>

<p>How much can others imagine the gap between the usual Senpai and the current Senpai?</p>

<p>How much can others seriously take Senpai&rsquo;s affectionate behavior?</p>

<p>After much thinking, pondering, and deliberation, I conclude that it&rsquo;s best if only I understand Senpai.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what it all comes down to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;ll hold back. It would be pointless if I&rsquo;m too selfish and you come to dislike me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t dislike you, but&#8230; well, it would help if you could restrain yourself a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I won&rsquo;t come to dislike her. Senpai and I will only part ways if Senpai gets tired of me or when there&rsquo;s no more fun in teasing me.</p>

<p>While I want to keep the stimulation of Senpai&rsquo;s teasing, I also want to live a life that&rsquo;s harder to be teased about.</p>

<p>With these complex feelings, I feel a sense of loneliness as the softness slowly moves away from my back.</p>

<p>As our breaths parted together, my heart raced, yet I felt a sense of calm settling in.</p>

<p>It was too soon to think that everything was alright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but can I do just this one last thing&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the softness was about to completely leave my back, I suddenly felt a ticklish sensation on the nape of my neck.</p>

<p>It was warm, reminiscent of the warmth I had felt in my ears.</p>

<p> Gradually, that warmth drew closer, and then, resting on my shoulders, were the familiar, beautiful, slender fingers of Senpai.</p>

<p>They seemed so fragile that they might break with just a little pressure.</p>

<p>These slightly annoying fingers had always been between our lips, interrupting our first kiss.</p>

<p>Looking for the owner of these fingers, I could still feel her presence behind me.</p>

<p>She was adjusting the bath towel wrapped around her body, and I could tell from the reflection in the mirror that her face was somewhat flushed.</p>

<p>Then, right after she said it was the last time, something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. For loving someone like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she gently, yet fervently, pressed her lips to my neck.</p>

<p>It was a light kiss, nothing compared to the deep ones we had shared before, but it felt different from all the others, and I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to leave the bathroom for a while.</p>
