<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Ah~, I finally did it~~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stepping out of Takashi-kun&rsquo;s room, I find a secluded spot and blush in agony.</p>

<p>I realize, belatedly, that I&rsquo;ve given away the kiss I&rsquo;d been holding back on, not wanting to seem too forward, as a tribute for his twentieth birthday.</p>

<p>Realizing this and acknowledging it, feeling the warmth spread through my body. I come to recognize, yet again, how much I truly like Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>Every time I think of him, the desire to kiss him again becomes unbearable.</p>

<p>This is the third time now. Right after leaving his room. Near the intersection close to his apartment. And then, in the back alley of the station&rsquo;s shopping district.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help but confirm my feelings over and over.</p>

<p> The answer my heart comes to is always the same. It hasn&rsquo;t changed.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t help it because I like him.</p>

<p>Even if the kiss was fueled by alcohol, the feelings I have for him won&rsquo;t change or fade.</p>

<p>No, maybe it was precisely because of the alcohol that I was finally able to kiss him.</p>

<p>Thinking about it that way, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad to rely on the liquid confidence from a drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yeah. Thinking about it won&rsquo;t change anything, time to head home! I&rsquo;ve got to start preparing for us to live together!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a renewed sense of determination, I undo my side tail and return to my usual look for going out, heading home.</p>

<p> &ldquo;At this hour, a beauty all alone&#8230; maybe there&rsquo;s a chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idiot! There&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;d be at the station at this time without someone waiting for her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right&#8230; Tch, I&rsquo;m jealous of the guy&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the murmuring around me. I have no interest in men who look at me with such base thoughts. I don&rsquo;t find them attractive at all.</p>

<p>What I like are men who are serious but sometimes show a cute side. That&rsquo;s the kind of man I&rsquo;m into.</p>

<p> Actually, I&rsquo;ve felt this way for the past year&#8230; ever since I saw him at a club&rsquo;s welcome event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I wish I could live with Takashi-kun quickly~&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wishful thought slips out. Living together, waking up together, and heading to university together.</p>

<p>Whoever gets home first prepares dinner and waits. Of course, we&rsquo;d eat together too.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just about meals. From evening to morning, we could be all lovey-dovey. What happened last night and today could happen every day from now on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to stop right now, my feelings only continue to speed up.</p>

<p>The day after tomorrow? Or maybe a week from now?</p>

<p>With anticipation in my heart and looking forward to our next kiss, I boarded the train home.</p>
