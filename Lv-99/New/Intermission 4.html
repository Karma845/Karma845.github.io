<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>&ldquo;I never imagined I&rsquo;d actually meet her in person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought to myself.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t considered the possibility of running into the girl who was the reason I ended up going to the bar with Takashi-kun. And of all places, it had to be at my favorite bar.</p>

<p>What a coincidence.</p>

<p>Just like me, she seemed to have her own issues.</p>

<p>Of course, everyone has their own circumstances, reasons I couldn&rsquo;t possibly know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a proper conversation with her sometime, maybe even about Takashi-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I found myself taking a liking to her, to Yuu-chan.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my first impression wasn&rsquo;t great.</p>

<p>Who wouldn&rsquo;t think so?</p>

<p> It&rsquo;s quite rude to keep your hoodie on during service. But if the establishment is fine with her appearance, then I guess it&rsquo;s not my place to complaint so much about it?</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;m dying to know what&rsquo;s going on in her mind that she continues to wear her hood like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Yuu-chan likes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>What she likes, what she dislikes, and how she became friends with Takashi-kun.</p>

<p>I want to know all sorts of things about her. Because she&rsquo;s Takashi-kun&rsquo;s best friend, I&rsquo;m desperate to know more about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can learn more about what kind of person Takashi-kun likes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If everyone knew what was in my heart, they&rsquo;d probably find it creepy or weird. Without really knowing me, most people only know me superficially.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t care about that. Rather, they&rsquo;re not even in my sight.</p>

<p>All I need is Takashi-kun.</p>

<p> In the restroom of the bar, I quietly thought so as I touched up my makeup.</p>
