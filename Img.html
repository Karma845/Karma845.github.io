<h2>Information about my Product</h2>

<p>Information about my product is about EPUB and PDF created by using the Fan TL or MTL in novel updates. So it's not like online shopping thing it's more like exchange interest.<p>

 <p>In order to download the epub and pdf, they need to fulfill the link shortener I add in exchange for the files.</p>

 <p>Another transaction I can provide in exchange from my service would be the Ko-Fi Membership Fee and Donations. I hope this will conclude the Information of the Product. I hope you will understand my situation. I thought it will at least lessen the possibility of being permanently limit if I upgrade to Business Class but it didn't.</p>
