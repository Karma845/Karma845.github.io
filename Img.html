<p>Now, in order to download my files, the users must need to tackle link shortener I provided and that would be Linkvertise. After the ad they can freely download my file, whether epub or pdf. So it's exchange interest. The users will get benefits but also me.</p>

<p>My main income would be the Linkvertise. I always cash out every month about 40$ above. Secondary income would be the donation and the membership. I already received I membership in my account and it's currently on-hold. I'm fine with it though, I can wait anyways.</p>

 <p>That's all about it. Straight to the point. I hope this is enough to conclude this limit. Thank you for listening my request.</p>
