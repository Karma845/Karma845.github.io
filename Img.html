<h1>Afterword</h1>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Have you ever heard of
Carlos Kaiser, the famous fraudster?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was a soccer player
who played in Brazil in the 1980s, and is now known as &lt;The Greatest
Fraudster&gt;. He was a liar who made a lot of money by signing contracts with
several soccer clubs for more than 20 years by lying and scamming, even though
he had almost no ability in soccer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His methods were very
clever. He got contracts by having star players he befriended in bars recommend
him, bribed journalists to write articles praising his abilities, and when he
was about to be forced to play a match, he had doctors write false medical
diagnoses so he could be absent on sick leave. When a powerful owner with ties
to gangsters ordered him to participate in a match, he pulled off a maneuver
that would have been out of a Con Game movie (check out the movie to see what
kind of maneuver he used).</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Despite all this, he
has never been arrested for fraud. On the contrary, he has been hailed as
&lt;the greatest soccer player who never played soccer&gt;, and his life was
even made into a movie.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is a series of
artful lies that even the deceivers would like to applaud, and such a miracle
of lies has been created.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As you may have
guessed if you have read this far, this work, [Lies, Fraud, and Psychic Ability
School], was inspired by an anecdote about Carlos Kaiser.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A first-rate
fraudster, always calm and collected, with a crazy sense of ethics, who charms
others with his artful lies, hides his true identity, and plays a dark role in
an elite school full of psychics</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">. Even I, as the author, could not predict what kind of story it would
be, but I went ahead and wrote it with enthusiasm. So, how was it? I hope you
enjoyed the pleasure of being deceived by these two liars.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Last but not least, I
would like to express my special gratitude to the two editors who were involved
in the publication of this work, to Kakao-sama for his wonderful illustrations,
to my friend for his advice on how to improve the work, and to the readers who
picked up this work. Thank you very much.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The battle of the
fraudsters continues. See you in the second volume!</span></span></p><p class="sc-bdvvtl">
