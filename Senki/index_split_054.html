<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_56">Chapter 95: Turmoil in the Holy City – Part fifteen</h1>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, what’s wrong?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Hikari.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’ve been thinking ever since I got back to the mansion. I keep thinking, but I just don’t understand. Should I talk to someone? I don’t know if two heads will be better than one in this case, but maybe I’ll figure something out that way.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The problem with that, is that I would have to explain my skills and my ability. I wouldn’t have to explain absolutely everything, but I would at the very least have to talk about what I can do.</p>

	<p class="block_2">How much should I tell? It’s hard to draw the line. I guess talking about how I was summoned from another world is out of bounds.</p>

	<p class="block_2">…</p>

	<p class="block_2">……</p>

	<p class="block_2">…………</p>

	<p class="block_2">…Maybe if I lived without any constraints, and led a quiet life all by myself, I wouldn’t have to worry about this sort of thing.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But would I be able to live alone like that without going mad? Could I live without being tormented by loneliness and anxiety? At this point, I don’t know. I do feel like the bonds I’ve made ever since I came to this world have done a lot for me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, what’s the matter?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s the whole reason why I bought Sera.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, what?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">And why I’m here with Hikari.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I think Leila and the others are back. Let’s talk over there.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I get up, and take Hikari and Sera with me to the guest room.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We wait for a bit until Leila and the others get here. First, I check what they’re going to do.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Do you have any plans?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Loux and Yuri are here too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila sits on a sofa and glances at them, before responding.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“There was a message from the church, saying they decided to announce to the public that there will be a stampede.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I think people related to the church that came from the countryside will be staying, but some merchant caravans will probably evacuate from the holy city. The same thing can be said for civilians and low ranked adventurers that came from the south and west.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yor expresses her thoughts too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Aren’t they going to be detained?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t believe they will. A stampede lasts a few days at least, and could go on for weeks. If that happens, supplies will be a problem, mainly food.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And they will last longer the fewer people are here…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Exactly. And it would mean more people to protect.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. So how does the church, or the guild, deal with a stampede?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Meet the monsters when they attack?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“B ranked adventurers and above will meet the monsters in the forest, taking advantage of the location. The rest will stay to defend. I hear the crusaders will deploy mobile units between the forest and the city.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“We are planning to join the defenders. What are you going to do, Sora?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It depends on the situation. There is also something I need to talk to you about. I’m sorry Loux and Yuri, but can I ask you to leave the room?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Both stand up, and I wait until they’re gone.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Then I activate Silence just in case.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, did you just use magic?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I figured no one would notice, because I chanted it in my mind, but it looks like Yor did. Did she feel magic energy moving?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, so sound doesn’t leak out of this room. It’s an application of Spatial Magic.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">They already know I can use Spatial Magic, because they know about the Item Box.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Is this something you don’t want Loux and Yuri to hear?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Yor.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s right. But first, I have a question. Is concealment magic common? I’ve never heard of it, but the way the guildmaster was talking and the way people reacted leads me to believe it is.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It’s not very common, master. I think it’s just that a lot of people there were high ranked adventurers.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I figured it must be a popular form of magic, because people accepted it without issue, but apparently I was wrong.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then it’s rare for people to be able to use it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That I don’t know. It’s hard to say because there are rumors that it’s partially controlled by the country. There are people that can use it but don’t tell anyone about it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So it wouldn’t really be strange if monsters used it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s what I’m most curious about. It’s not completely impossible, because there are superior species of mage type monsters.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I have never seen monsters use it, but I have seen dungeons use it a few times.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Leila with a really displeased look on her face. Are those memories that I should leave alone? Probably.</p>
	<p class="block_2">“What about you, Sera?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I haven’t seen monsters use that either, but I can’t detect magic in the first place.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">And it’s such large-scale too. It feels contrived.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Getting back to the main topic. I think it’s important for you to follow this, so I’ll start from the beginning.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I check to see if everyone’s attention is on me. I sound kind of pretentious, but I can’t help it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Let’s start from when someone sniped at Mia. I picked up who did it with an ability of mine, but I was injured and Mia fainted, so I couldn’t chase the perpetrator. But later I went out with Mia, and followed this person to discover where he was hiding.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Talia looks really interested. She probably thinks this ability would be very useful for a scout.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It’s not infallible or anything. Things like distance can be a problem, and I need to focus while I use it, so it’s tiring, and using it for a long time is difficult.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I explain it in a way that makes it sound like the technique Luilui uses, although it’s a completely different thing.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But I’m getting off track.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So we chased the perpetrator, but at some point I lost the reaction.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“In that building you went to check out before?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. And I saw one of Mia’s attendants there, entering that building. I watched the building with my eyes and that ability, but the ability turned off and I lost the reaction as that person entered the building.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Do you think that could be because of concealment magic?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know that much, but probably. I did report this to Dan though.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So you think the magic being used in that building and the concealment magic used on the monsters are related?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Yor, but I’m not sure.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you worried about Mia, master?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Hikari, and those words hit me like a brick.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I see. So that’s why I’m feeling anxious. We spent some time together and got to know each other, so I can’t let things end like this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. You’re right. I’m worried about Mia. That’s why I want to find out if this whole series of events is connected to something that will harm her.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You’re probably overthinking it. Mia is a saint, but that’s mostly a ceremonial role, with pretty much no real political power. She might be more popular than the leader of the church, but she doesn’t really have the power to do anything, even if she has the support of the people.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I agree with Yor, but we do know for a fact that someone is after Mia. And if someone related to the church was there, that may mean there are people who don’t think fondly of her.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Just as I was starting to feel a bit relieved by Yor’s words, Leila’s takes that away. I feel like I’m back at the start.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But that would mean that people related to the church used concealment magic and brought monsters together. I cannot see the merit in that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">It could be that they’re two completely separate issues, and the use of concealment magic was just a coincidence.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Did I just overthink it?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You should ask my father. He might have learned something about this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yes, that’s a good idea.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila and her party rest for a while, and then put on their equipment and head to the guild.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The rest of us go to the church to talk to Dan.</p>
