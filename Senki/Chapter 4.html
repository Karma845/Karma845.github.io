<h1>Chapter 4: Is It Okay to Play Games with My Oshi?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Ohhh, so this is the rumored e-sports cafe that I’ve heard so much about…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>A sigh of admiration escaped naturally from my lips.</p>



<p>In front of me were rows of gaming PCs, and near the back, I could see something resembling a bar counter.  There were even special seats for spectators equipped with monitors and giant displays.</p>



<p>“Hehe, impressive, isn’t it? It’s the largest gaming facility in the country.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Indeed, it was a facility large enough to even host national tournaments. I nodded in agreement, acknowledging Serika’s proud smile.</p>



<p>On a certain holiday, I found myself at a newly opened e-sports cafe. The reason for my visit stems from an invitation from my childhood friend who was currently lounging next to me.</p>



<p>One night, I received a message from Serika asking if I wanted to go to a gaming cafe next time we were free and I couldn’t help but think, “What’s gotten into her all of a sudden?” But now that I’m here, I can safely say that it was the right decision.</p>



<p>“Wow, this is amazing… I’ve never been to a place like this before, but it’s way more impressive than I imagined. My gamer blood is boiling!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s your first time?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Heh, yeah. I’m more of a solo player, you know. I didn’t have any acquaintances who would drag me to places like this.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Don’t try to make being a loner sound cool.” (Serika)</p>



<p>As expected of Serika, being my childhood friend, she understands me all too well. And she’s merciless.</p>



<p>“But well, it worked out for the best, didn’t it? You should be grateful to me for creating this opportunity.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Yeah, seriously, I’m grateful. Thank you, Serika.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Yay (<em>yatta</em>)! I helped Ketaro…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika seemed to be doing some sort of strange victory pose, but putting that aside, I was absorbed in looking around the store. It would be exciting to see highlights of games on the big screen.</p>



<p>“Wow, it’s so big…! This is amazing, Kei-kun!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As I was pondering such thoughts, a voice came from behind, and when I turned around, Yuki was smiling and expressing her thoughts while looking around just like me.</p>



<p>Since Yuki had seen our exchange on messaging, she asked if she could join us, to which Serika readily agreed.</p>



<p>…I feel like the line that shouldn’t be crossed is getting lower and lower. Well, just for today, I have no choice but to reluctantly accept it as just classmates hanging out.</p>



<p>“Huh… is it me or does it seem like there’s no one else here?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>At that moment, Yuki started to look around as if she had suddenly noticed something.</p>



<p>…Now that she mentioned it, I was so excited that I hadn’t noticed, but are there really no other people here besides us?</p>



<p>The store was eerily quiet, with not even a single customer or staff member in sight. What’s going on?</p>



<p>“Ah, well, of course. I reserved the whole place today.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Reserved? You can do that? That’s amazing!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki seemed impressed and surprised by Serika’s words, but I was surprised for a different reason.</p>



<p>“For you to reserve an entire facility like this… the scale of your actions is as messed up as ever…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What are you talking about? This is nothing special.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean by ‘nothing special’?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Upon hearing our conversation, Yuki tilted her head. Why is it that every little gesture of hers is so cute? Well, putting that aside, I hesitated for a moment before directing my gaze towards Serika, wondering if it was okay to say anything. When Serika noticed my gaze, she nodded slightly, giving me the okay.</p>



<p>“Actually, Serika is from a really prestigious family. Her parents are from the founding family of a major corporation—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I mentioned the name of the company, which I’m sure everyone knows…</p>



<p>“Eh, that big company!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki looked surprised, as expected.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right. So, since this facility belongs to our group, I could reserve it quite easily.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika’s straightforward and proud manner of speaking without hiding things like this is so typical of her. </p>



<p>Well, I’ve known her for a long time so I know that she always states the facts as it is without any intention of sarcasm or stuff like that, but this tends to lead to misunderstanding with others not so familiar with her personality.</p>



<p>“Wow, that’s amazing, Serika-chan!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Fortunately, Yuki seemed genuinely impressed. She’s so honest. She’s truly an angel.</p>



<p>“Heh, well, it’s nothing much, really.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Don’t get too carried away.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I-I’m not getting carried away or anything! I don’t usually do stuff like this, you know. Today is special, really special! I went out of my way to reserve it just to invite you, my oshi!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika boasted with a smug expression. Honestly, I’m torn between thinking “she didn’t have to go that far” and “she went that far just for me?” It’s hard to know if I should just be happy about it or not. I understand the feeling of wanting to do something for your oshi, but her scale of doing things is just way too different.</p>



<p>“Heh, well, that just shows how much I support Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika, for some reason, directed a triumphant glance at Yuki. I feel bad for feeling oddly satisfied by it, but…</p>



<p>“Yeah, but isn’t reserving the whole place going a bit overboard?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-What do you mean? It’s not going overboard at all. Besides, with top-level influencers gathering here, it’s only natural to reserve it, given the circumstances.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah, I guess that makes sense…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Leaving aside Mariel-sama, whose real identity is supposed to be hidden, if a top idol like Yuki is coming, such considerations might indeed be necessary. It could cause a panic otherwise.</p>



<p>But still, Serika is one of the few people who could reserve the whole place for such a reason.</p>



<p>“Oh, definitely. There is an idol, a VTuber… and also the new hottest game streamer here.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…? Wait, are you talking about me?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Of course she is. If there were customers here and they found out you were that Kei, it would cause a huge panic.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“How much are you overestimating me!? There’s no way that would happen!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“No, Serika-san is right. It would probably cause a riot with people clamoring for Kei-kun’s autograph. As expected of Serika-san, she foresaw that!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Heh, exactly. You understand it all too well, Yukina Nozomi!” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Wait, why are they mysteriously bonding over this? If anyone were to cause a riot when discovered, it would be them, not me. Why are they lifting me up like this while ignoring themselves? Their exaggerated praise of me is starting to scare me.</p>



<p>After all the excitement, Serika then continues with, “And also…”</p>



<p>“Influencers aren’t the only ones here, you know. There’s also a certain popular cosplayer.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika directed her gaze towards behind me. Perhaps in response to her words, I felt a tight grip on my clothes from behind.</p>



<p>When I turned around, I saw Sana peeking cautiously from behind me, as if trying to hide her presence. Actually, Sana had also come here with us today.</p>



<p>When Serika and Yuki expressed their desire to meet her, I hesitantly asked if she wanted to come along, and surprisingly, she agreed. She’s generally an indoorsy type and wasn’t really interested in games or anything like that, but I’m glad that she came.</p>



<p>However, it’s not good for her to keep hiding behind me like this. Sana is naturally shy, but it’s the first time I’ve seen her so cautious. Could it be that she’s feeling overwhelmed by Serika and Yuki’s strong personalities? I can understand that feeling.</p>



<p>“Come on, it’s about time you came out and said hello.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Leaving that aside, I lightly pushed Sana’s back to encourage her. At first, she seemed hesitant, but eventually, she stepped forward and looked directly at Serika.</p>



<p>“…Amamiya Sana. Onii-chan imouto <em>desu</em>.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Saionji Serika. Ketaro’s childhood friend.” (Serika)</p>



<p>After this brief and concise exchange, for some reason, they continued to stare silently at each other without saying a word. A moment of silence passed, and there was a tense atmosphere in the air.</p>



<p>…What’s with this atmosphere?</p>



<p>But eventually, they both opened their mouths simultaneously and spoke.</p>



<p>“…Cute.” (Serika &amp; Sana)</p>



<p>And just as their voices harmonized beautifully, for some reason, this time both of them turned their sharp gazes towards me. Caught off guard, I instinctively took a step back.</p>



<p>“Hey Ketaro, I didn’t expect imouto-san to be this cute!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, you’ve never mentioned that your childhood friend is this beautiful.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“W-Wait, how is this my fault!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Concealment of information.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Failure to report.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“This makes no sense!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Besides, how is it possible that I’ve never heard that you had an imouto until recently? What’s the meaning of this?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Sana didn’t hear anything about onii-chan having a childhood friend either. And a girl, no less.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, it can’t be helped! We haven’t seen each other in years!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>, looks like we’re both having a hard time. Let’s get along from now on.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Likewise.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Somehow they’ve ended up getting along… which is fine and all, but what was up with that whole exchange?</p>



<p>As I was feeling bewildered, I heard a soft, dreamy voice, “Fuwaa…” and when I turned around, Yuki was sending warm glances towards Sana.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun’s imouto-sanis so cute… I thought she was cute when I saw her cosplay photos, but seeing her in person, she’s even cuter… that’s amazing…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…T-Thank you.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana mumbled in confusion in response to Yuki’s constant praise.</p>



<p>Seems like she’s feeling embarrassed being called cute repeatedly, as her face turned red and she fidgeted nervously.</p>



<p>“I’m Yukina Nozomi. I’m Kei-kun’s classmate. Nice to meet you, Sana-chan.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…N-Nice to meet you too.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Seemingly overwhelmed by Yuki’s straightforward demeanor, Sana turned towards me as if seeking refuge.</p>



<p>“…She’s different from what Sana expected. She’s still incredibly beautiful, but the image I had from seeing her on TV or in videos was more, like, cool and charismatic…” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, I get what you’re saying. I was also taken aback at first.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, I’m sorry. I just can’t help but get excited when I’m with Kei-kun. I try to be mindful of it, but… But seeing Kei-kun like this just gets me so pumped up. Ahh~ seeing Kei-kun acting like an older brother for the first time…! His slightly blunt demeanor is rare and cool…! Precious…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Both Sana and I were at a loss for words at Yuki’s sudden outburst.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun must be such a reliable older brother… ‘If you have any problems, just tell me. Onii-chan will solve it for you,’ kind of vibe, right…? Ah~ it’s too much…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s not true.” (Both)</p>



<p>Once again, both Sana and I chimed in to retort against Yuki’s wild imagination.</p>



<p>I mean, it’s nice to be admired by your oshi, but being overly idealized can be troublesome. It seems like Sana is also taken aback by this part of her.</p>



<p>“…She’s strong. Sana senses an unpredictable aura around her…” (Sana)</p>



<p>“What kind of impression is that supposed to be?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Sana looked at Yuki with a cautious expression as she squirmed. Mysterious.</p>



<p>“Alright, now that introductions are over, let’s get started.” (Serika)</p>



<p>At that moment, Serika clapped her hands together and announced it.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>“…Get started with what?” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana tilted her head in confusion, but come to think of it, I don’t think Serika and I mentioned the purpose of coming to the esports cafe today.</p>



<p>“Well, actually, Serika asked if I could teach her some gaming techniques I use in person.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“That’s right. So, I chose this place since we can openly play games here.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…But now that I think about it, couldn’t we have just done that at your place or mine? Was it really necessary to reserve this entire place?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Y-You’re being annoying. I wanted to show them my level of support—I mean! I thought you might be interested, so I chose this place! Was that a problem!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“No, not at all. I’m very interested so I’m happy you brought me here.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement with Serika, who was enthusiastically explaining while blushing. In times like these, it’s best to just go along with Serika’s excitement. Besides, it’s not every day I get to come to a place like this, so I’m genuinely glad.</p>



<p>“Alright then. Let’s get started. Teach me, Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika looked satisfied with my response. She really hasn’t changed since we were kids.</p>



<p>“…What are these gaming techniques we talking about, though?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, <em>imouto-san</em>, haven’t you seen that one play Ketaro pulled off during my stream?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Saw it. Sana knows onii-chan was amazing, but she didn’t really understand what was so amazing about it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“That play was truly wonderful. Oh, but even though Kei-kun wiped out the enemies in an instant, I don’t really understand what he did specifically.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Well, that’s how it is. Alright, Ketaro, why don’t you demonstrate once? I want to see it live too.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Sure thing.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I sat down at the computer, booted up LoF, selected my character, and headed to the training ground. There, I picked up the 777 Magnum and stood in front of the training dummy targets.</p>



<p>…Doing this while being watched by my oshis makes me even more nervous than during the actual match last time. It feels like there’s even more pressure not to mess up this time.</p>



<p>I took a deep breath to calm myself and focused. Then, with quick movements of my fingers, three gunshots rang out in rapid succession, and all three dummy targets fell with their heads shattered.</p>



<p>“…Wow, onii-chan, that was amazing.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Amazing, amazing! Kei-kun, you’re so cool!” (Nozomi) </p>



<p>“Seeing it again, your skills are something else. It’s no wonder you can pull it off in real matches, Keitaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>All three of them showered me with praise, which made me feel a bit embarrassed.</p>



<p>…But honestly, I’ve never been more glad that I practiced today!</p>



<p>“So was that the technique you mentioned? Shooting all their heads was impressive?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, with practice, anyone can do that. What’s impressive is being able to rapid-fire the 777 Magnum and still land headshots.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Oh, now that you mention it, yeah. I admire Kei-kun and use the 777 Magnum too, but it’s really difficult to handle. I can’t use it as well as you do.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“The thing is that the 777 Magnum has very specific performance characteristics. It packs a punch if you hit your target, but it only holds seven rounds, has a strong recoil, and most importantly, it has a long cooldown between shots. It usually takes almost a second to fire the next round.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…But onii-chan, you were shooting so quickly.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s the interesting part. Honestly, I don’t even know how he did it, which is why I wanted Ketaro to teach us… So, Ketaro, what’s the secret?” (Serika)</p>



<p>At that moment, Seika turned her gaze towards me. Of course, I’ll gladly explain.</p>



<p>“Well, to put it simply, there’s a technique that allows you to shorten that firing interval. Oh, and just to be clear, this isn’t some kind of exploit or bug, okay?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I’ve made a personal commitment to never exploit bugs intentionally. Doing so not only shortens the lifespan of the game but also disrespects the integrity of the game itself. Exploiting bugs is on par with cheating and is something I vehemently oppose as a gamer.</p>



<p>“When I first discovered it, I made sure to ask the developers and received confirmation that it’s within the game’s specifications. And if you look hard enough, you’ll find this technique documented on the game’s official strategy wiki as well.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh? Really?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Yeah, and just so you know, I’m the one who added it to the wiki.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Sharing information about game mechanics is crucial. But judging by everyone’s reactions, it seems like it’s not widely known. …It’s a bit disappointing considering I took the time to document it.</p>



<p>“Wow, you even put it on the wiki? That’s amazing, Kei-kun!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Well, it’s a normal thing to do. So, about the details… Essentially, it utilizes the fact that you can cancel the cooldown time for the next shot using a punch motion.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Punch motion?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Seems like Seika isn’t quite getting it, so I’ll explain further.</p>



<p>“When you punch right after holding a weapon, you can do it instantly, right? Well, at that moment, the cooldown for the weapon’s firing interval resets. So, by canceling that punch motion and immediately re-equipping the weapon, you can shoot the next round right away.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh, there was such a mechanic!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>It’s no wonder she’s surprised. I mean, you wouldn’t notice such a mechanic while playing normally, and even if you did, it wouldn’t necessarily mean much. Typically, at least.</p>



<p>“B-But… wouldn’t it take even longer to shoot if you have to fire, then punch, then fire again? Not to mention, I didn’t see anything like that happening when you were doing it.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“That’s because the cancel happens faster than the punching animation. By the way, the window for each cancellation is just one frame.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“O-One frame!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…What’s a ‘frame’?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“A frame refers to a unit of time. It’s one-sixtieth of a second, so one frame equals 1/60th of a second. In other words, Ketaro was doing it at an incredibly fast and precise speed.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“In other words, it goes like this: Shoot one round with the Magnum, perform a punch motion in one frame, cancel it in the next frame, and then quickly return to aiming the Magnum. Since the firing interval is reset during this sequence, you can shoot again immediately. As a result, you can fire in rapid succession. This technique only works with the Magnum, so we call it the ‘Magnum Cancel’—or ‘Mag-can’ for short.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>When I first discovered this feature, I was thrilled, thinking, “Now I can fire the Magnum in rapid succession!” However, since the input has to be frame-perfect, it’s incredibly difficult to execute consistently. I’ve practiced it a lot myself, but I still can’t pull it off perfectly every time. Plus, this technique only works with the 777 Magnum, so it’s more of a novelty or show-off move. Honestly, why bother with this when you could just use a regular assault rifle?</p>



<p>…Well, that’s probably why no one knows about this technique. Even though I wrote about it on the wiki. Everyone, let’s use the Magnum more! Let’s stop treating it like a joke weapon.</p>



<p>“I can’t believe you were doing something so amazing… Ahh~…! Kei-kun, you’re the best! I’ll keep using the Magnum from now on!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Ah, no, if you’re a beginner, you should just stick with a submachine gun or shotgun…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I take back what I said earlier. The Magnum is definitely a joke weapon. If it’s too hard and you end up quitting the game because of it, I would rather you just use a strong weapon normally.</p>



<p>“To be able to pull off such a technique at a moment’s notice, that’s amazing! Since you got off three consecutive shots, it means that you had to execute four consecutive frame-perfect inputs while aiming for the head… Truly impressive. As expected of my childhood friend──… Oh, I mean, my oshi!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Hmm, onii-chan is really amazing after all… Hehe.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Everyone’s praise is genuinely heartwarming, to be honest. It’s a stark contrast to before when I would make such plays during streams and hardly get any reaction. Well, hardly anyone was watching back then.</p>



<p>“Alright, now that I understand the principle, I’m going to master it right away! Ketaro, please teach me in detail about finger placement and everything.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh, are you really going to try it? Even though it’s a technique that won’t be very useful in actual matches?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I want to try it out for myself, so it’s fine! Come on, watch me!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Well, it would be nice if Mariel-sama ends up showcasing the technique during her stream, so I have no problem teaching her.</p>



<p>Sitting at the adjacent seat, Serika launches LoF and heads to the training ground.</p>



<p>She picks up the Magnum and aims at the target dummy, firing shots. However, unlike me,  all that echoes are the sounds of gunfire every second or the sound of her punching the air.</p>



<p>“Hmm… This is tough… How do you even start?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“First, focus on canceling with a punch right after firing.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I know, but… Ugh! I just can’t seem to get it right!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, it takes some practice. Try tapping the trigger right after a shot rather than focusing on the rhythm…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I say this, I reach out to guide Serika’s hand from behind. But at that moment, Serika’s body jerks slightly.</p>



<p>“W-W-W-What are you doing!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I thought feeling it firsthand would help you understand… W-Why is your face all red!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I-It can’t be helped, can it!? If Ketaro…I mean my oshi teaches me in such a way, of course, I’d react like this!” (Serika)</p>



<p>I-If you put it that way, even I’d feel embarrassed! And hearing her mention ‘oshi’ suddenly makes me think of Mariel-sama… Wait, teaching Mariel-sama like this… Whoa, dangerous. Just the thought is dangerous…!</p>



<p>“S-Sorry about that. Then, I’ll just explain it out loud—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“N-No! I didn’t say to stop! I-I was just surprised, that’s all!” (Serika)</p>



<p>As I try to back away, Serika stops me and insists that I continue.</p>



<p>And so I had no choice but to maintain our position, but once you become conscious of it, it’s incredibly embarrassing. Maybe we could only maintain it because we’re childhood friends.</p>



<p>“Oh! Did I just do it? Did I do it!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Eventually, Serika successfully performed the Mag-can. It was probably just a coincidence since it only happened once, but it still counts, so I nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>“Yay! I did it! I finally did it! Alright, I just need to master this feeling and show them what Kei taught me on stream…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Filled with determination, Serika starts practicing alone. Watching her back, I suddenly feel nostalgic.</p>



<p>“…But you’ve really improved, haven’t you?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I mean with games. You didn’t really enjoy playing games in the past, but now you’re suddenly into it. Just from watching Mariel-sama’s streams, I know you’re skilled.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, that’s…” (Serika)</p>



<p>My words caused Serika to blush and avert her gaze.</p>



<p>“…I, I just wanted to be perfect for you… So, I practiced a lot…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? Perfect?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“N-No, I mean… you used to play games all the time, right? I realized, not long after, that I got interested in them because of that! It’s all your fault for having such a weird influence on me!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Despite her attempts to brush it off, Serika’s cheeks turned bright red, extending to her ears. …Was she embarrassed about getting hooked on gaming, considering how much she used to disdain it? It just means you’ve finally discovered the charm of gaming, albeit a little late. Yeah.</p>



<p>“Um, Kei-kun…?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Lost in thought, I turn around at the sound of a voice, only to find Yuki glancing over here with a bashful expression.</p>



<p>“If possible, um… I’d like Kei-kun to teach me LoF too…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh? Me?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah… I started playing LoF because I admired Kei-kun, but I’m not getting very good at it. When I saw you teaching Serika-san, I thought it’d be nice to learn from you too… Is that okay?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>…Hey, are there any fans who would turn down a request like that from their idol? Seriously, you need to realize that you’re my oshi. Of course, there’s no option but to say yes. Despite the issue of maintaining proper distance, I guess it’s a little late for that, especially when we’re in a place like this where we’re all together.</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan.” (Sana)</p>



<p>At that moment, my clothes are tugged on, and Sana speaks up too.</p>



<p>“…Sana wants to play games too. Onii-chan, can you teach her?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“You too? But you weren’t really interested in games before, were you?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I returned the question with a raised eyebrow. Until now, Sana hadn’t shown any interest in games, even at home. What brought about this sudden change?</p>



<p>“…San just felt like trying it. Besides, coming to a place like this and not doing anything feels weird.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Well, she’s got a point. …But, you know, it makes me happy. Otakus are happiest when others take an interest in what they love. If there are girls out there who want to win over an otaku guy, they should be aware of that. I don’t know if there are any girls like that, though.</p>



<p>“Alright, shall we all enter the same training room?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki and Sana sat in the seats behind me, each launching LoF. Yuki logged in with her ID, while Sana created a new ID and logged in.</p>



<p>“Well then, Yuki, could you run through the course first?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>To gauge Yuki’s proficiency before starting her instruction, I decided to have her run through the basic course in the training area.</p>



<p>“…Oops, missed a shot.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Hmm, your basic movements are fine, but it seems like you had trouble with using the weapon…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Based on the results, it seemed that while her movements were good, she was struggling with handling the weapon. So, I suggested a change of weapon.</p>



<p>“Huh!? But I want to stick with this setup…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“You’re using the Magnum and Sniper Rifle combo, right? That’s my…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s the Kei-kun set!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>That combination happens to be one I often use, but both weapons are single-shot and difficult to handle. By the way, the “Kei-kun set” isn’t a name I came up with; it’s just what she called it.</p>



<p>“Those two weapons are honestly not very versatile, so it’s better to avoid them at first.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ugh, but I want to be like Kei-kun…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“I appreciate that sentiment, but personally, I’d like you to use more user-friendly weapons and gradually become better. After all, if you can’t win, the game stops being fun, and if you end up disliking LoF because of that, I wouldn’t like it either.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh, does that mean you’re worried about me…?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I nodded in agreement, and Yuki’s face broke into a relieved smile.</p>



<p>“Yes! I got it! I’ll stop using this set! I’ll use the weapons you recommend!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That was quick!? Well, I appreciate it, but are you sure!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Because Kei-kun was thinking about me! <em>Haa</em>~ Having Kei-kun choose something that suits me, I don’t think there are many girls as happy as I am!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“We are talking about guns, though…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Um, um, how can I repay this kindness? All I can think of is paying for it… H-How much is it!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“No, that’s not necessary!? And what’s up with your habit of wanting to pay me…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“But, getting one-on-one guidance from Kei-kun can’t be free!… Ah, saying it out loud makes it even more precious…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>If anything, being able to give one-on-one guidance to Yuki would be far more precious!? Something like that is impossible no matter how much you pay for it!</p>



<p>…But, the fact that I’m doing something that would normally be impossible… no, I need to stop. I need to maintain my distance…!</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, are you ready? I’m done.” (Sana)</p>



<p>At that moment, Sana, who had been doing the tutorial, called out to me, providing a perfect opportunity to try to cool down. Great timing, Sana.</p>



<p>“R-Right, you should have a basic understanding of the movements now. Um, let’s see, then why don’t you try shooting that dummy with any weapon?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Sure…” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I suggested, Sana began to aim and shoot. Surprisingly, her accuracy was quite good, and she seemed to naturally correct the recoil of the gun barrel caused by firing.</p>



<p>…Could it be that Sana actually has some talent?</p>



<p>“Good job. Now, try shooting at that moving dummy over there.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, this time, she hardly hit any shots at all, leaving me puzzled.</p>



<p>After observing various actions, such as shooting while running or moving using slides, it became apparent that Sana seemed to struggle with multitasking, like shooting while running or sliding.</p>



<p>“…Difficult.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana pouted, but it was impressive that she could hit the target accurately for the first time, even if it was only while standing still. When I mentioned that it was just a matter of practice and she could easily improve with time, Sana responded with a quiet “Yeah,” seeming somewhat pleased.</p>



<p>“That’s right, Sana-chan. Being able to control recoil like that is really impressive. Even though I’ve been playing for a while, my shots still tend to scatter.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki, who had been listening nearby, also encouraged Sana. </p>



<p>“There are some tricks in controlling recoil for each weapon. For example, with this weapon, you would do it like this.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I picked up Yuki’s mouse and demonstrated how I would control my recoil. When she saw the shots tightly grouped at the center of the target, Yuki cheered in excitement.</p>



<p>“Amazing! Can you teach me too? Can you guide me with your hands on top of mine?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…Eh? With my hands?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Just like you did with Serika-san earlier, lay your hands on top of mine, Kei-kun…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>N-No way! T-That’s definitely not okay, right!? A-Asking me to lay my hands on Yuki’s hands, that’s just…! I mean, that’s just…!</p>



<p>“You did it with Serika-san earlier… but, I guess it’s not okay?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Please don’t look at me with those puppy dog eyes as if you’ve been abandoned! You’re already my oshi, so there’s no way I can refuse, right!?</p>



<p>In my head, I repeat “maintain distance, maintain distance, classmates, classmates” like a mantra while I place my hand on top of Yuki’s. …I-I need to finish this quick. Her hand is unbelievably soft and warm…!</p>



<p>Th-This is Yuki’s hand…! N-No, stop thinking like that! Damn it, I’m a gamer too. There’s no way I’ll let such distractions affect my recoil control!!</p>



<p>I forcibly suppressed my feelings and pulled the trigger, managing to hit the center of the target without any deviation. Undoubtedly, it was the most concentrated show I had ever done in my life.</p>



<p>“<em>Fwah</em>…! K-Kei-kun’s hand is on top of mine…! I-I’ll never forget this feeling for as long as I live! Please allow me to repay you!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“N-No, what you shouldn’t forget is the feeling of recoil control, okay!? And you don’t need to pay me anything!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Seeing Yuki with a bright red face and looking dreamy, I couldn’t help but give her a full-force retort. Otherwise, I felt like I was about to hit my limit.</p>



<p>“…Mgmm, Onii-chan, Sana also wants to—” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Aaaahhhh!! W-W-What the heck are you doing?!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Just as Sana was about to finish her sentence, Serika’s voice cut in from behind, drowning out her voice. Weren’t you supposed to be practicing Mag-can?</p>



<p>“Um, I was just helping her with her recoil control.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Mugugu, so that’s what it was…! I-If that’s the case, you should teach me too!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? You’re already more than capable, aren’t you? I mean, I never missed Mariel-sama’s streams, so I know how good you are at it. And you’re already in Platinum rank.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Y-You’ve been watching all of them…? I mean, that’s not the point! …Ugh, I can’t believe I worked so hard to improve my skills, only for this to happen…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about?!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“A-Anyways, make sure to watch me practice too! There’s still plenty of things you can teach me to climb from Platinum to Diamond, right?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Ah, Kei-kun, Kei-kun, I want you to teach me more too. At least until I can reach Silver, I don’t want to let you down, Kei-kun.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…Leaving your beginner imouto alone like that, you’re such a hopeless skirt-chaser onii-chan.” (Sana)</p>



<p>And then, all three of them insisted on practicing together, causing quite a commotion… But, um, Sana-san? Your comment there is completely unrelated, isn’t it? Especially the last part.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“Wait, before we start, um, just practicing all the time would be boring, right? So, how about we play a game together for once? Experiencing the real thing is much more beneficial than just practicing.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Unable to contain myself, I proposed that idea. By the way, it’s not like I’m just grasping at straws; experiencing real battles is indeed important. It’s through those experiences that practice becomes meaningful.</p>



<p>“That’s easy for you to say, but jumping straight into a real match seems reckless, doesn’t it? I mean, Yukina Nozomii might have experience, but imouto-san doesn’t, right? Plus, there are four of us so we can’t participate in ranked matches with that number.” (Serika)</p>



<p>LoF’s ranked matches require teams of three. So, Serika’s right; we can’t do ranked matches, but I already know that. Taking an inexperienced player like Sana into ranked matches is out of the question.</p>



<p>“That’s why we should play the campaign mode against CPUs. With that, the number of players is more flexible.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>The reason LoF is considered a great game isn’t just because of its perfection in its genre; it’s also because of the various ways you can enjoy it. Apart from ranked matches, there are customizable matches with free rule settings and a campaign mode where you can battle against CPUs. And none of these modes are half-baked; they’re all well-made. With all these options, there is always something interesting to do.</p>



<p>“Oh, the campaign mode, huh? I’ve never tried that before.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Yeah, but I’ve heard LoF’s campaign mode is pretty interesting, right?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Yup, the campaign mode is super well-fleshed out that there are even players who exclusively play the campaign mode. Videos of them are relatively popular too.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>While I mostly focus on ranked matches, I’ve played the campaign mode a few times. It’s pretty well-designed such that even if you’re not good at PvP, you can still enjoy it. Let’s all give it a try (<em>shameless</em> <em>advertisement</em>).</p>



<p>With that settled, the four of us decided to play the campaign mode together.</p>



<p>While we progressed through the campaign, Serika and I supported Yuki, who isn’t good at FPS games, and Sana, who is a complete beginner. LoF had a progressive difficulty adjustment. At first, we were all having fun together, but gradually, the enemy became harder. Somehow, we managed to reach the final boss, but…</p>



<p>“Oh, s-sorry!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Defeated. Ugh…” (Sana)</p>



<p>In the end, it was getting harder to support Yuki and Sana so they got eliminated not long after the fight started.</p>



<p>“Ah!? They can spawn behind us?! How cowardly…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Next, we got caught in a surprise attack, and I wasn’t able to save Serika in time so she got eliminated.</p>



<p>What was supposed to be a four-man fight turned into a solo fight. No matter how you look at it, It’s a completely unfavorable position. However, I don’t intend to give up. For the sake of my comrades, and my pride as a gamer, I absolutely cannot afford to lose.</p>



<p>As the final boss fires multiple shots that fill the screen, I maneuver through them with quick precision and attack whenever I find an opening. If I don’t dodge and land my hits, there’s no way to win.</p>



<p>“…A-Amazing. You can move like that…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Wow…! Kei-kun, Kei-kun, Kei-kun…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, you’re so cool…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Without realizing it, everyone had left their seats and gathered around me. They stared intently at my screen, holding their breath as they watched the outcome of the battle.</p>



<p>As I fully immersed myself in the game, the moment of reckoning arrived.</p>



<p>With a tremendous roar and explosion, the final boss crumbled away. Simultaneously, the words “Mission Complete” appeared on the screen, along with the score and time.</p>



<p>“<em>Haaa</em>… I did it somehow…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the adrenaline of the game, I involuntarily stood up and took a deep breath.</p>



<p>As I was about to turn to look at everyone, I felt something soft on my arm.</p>



<p>“That was awesome! You’re really amazing, Kei-kun…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“W-What!? Yuki-san!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I panicked as I saw Yuki clinging to my arm, her eyes glistening with tears.</p>



<p>Th-These two soft sensations… could it be!? Before I could even process the situation, I felt another sensation, this time on my other arm, and when I turned, Serika was looking at me with a bright red face.</p>



<p>“W-Why are you…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I-It can’t be helped, right?! It’s unfair if it’s just Yukina Nozomi, right…?! A-And besides, it’s only natural to get emotional when your oshi achieves something amazing!” (Serika)</p>



<p>For some reason, Serika said this with a hint of anger and then pulled me into a tight hug. And at the same time, I felt something pressing against my back!?</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, that was amazing…! You were so cool…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>This time, it was Sana speaking, and her voice could be heard near my ear. She was unusually excited, so I could tell that she was genuinely happy about my victory.</p>



<p>Anyways, as I was being pulled from both sides and embraced from behind, and considering my half-standing posture, it was only a matter of time before I lost my balance…!</p>



<p>“Whoa, watch out…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Everyone fell on me, or rather, it felt like they were crushing me under their weight… As I entertained the thought that even in this position, girls are surprisingly soft, I wondered if this was some sort of divine punishment directed at me.</p>



<p>“K-Kei-kun, are you okay!?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Fortunately, everyone quickly got off me, which was a relief.</p>



<p>As I stood up, I saw Yuki looking at me apologetically.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry…! I got carried away…! What if I hurt you, Kei-kun!? I’ll cover all the medical expenses…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“No, it’s okay! Look, I’m perfectly fine, see!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Well, it wasn’t that big of a deal, right? Girls are as light as angel feathers, so it’s fine!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“You should at least show some remorse!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Seriously, you were pretty heavy! Just because you’re cute doesn’t mean everything about you is perfect!</p>



<p id="imagetext"><a href="#image">Well, knowing that everyone was genuinely happy about the victory, I didn’t get mad. If anything, I felt happy about it. In the end, it was a victory we achieved through everyone’s efforts. That’s why I love coop games. It’s always so entertaining to see the drama unfold in each moment.</a></p>



<p>“Oh, right, now isn’t the time for this.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Lost in such thoughts, Serika suddenly spoke with a face that seemed to recall something.</p>



<p>“Ketaro, log in to YouTube right now and prepare to upload.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Upload what? What do you mean?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“You know, the video of the game we just played. Especially the part where you soloed the final boss.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Even if you suddenly say that, I didn’t record anything—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I took care of that already!” (Serika)</p>



<p>When did you do that!? I didn’t even notice at all!</p>



<p>“Oh, I recorded it too.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Sana too.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh!? Why am I the only one left out!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Obviously, we always record our oshi’s matches. Anyways, I have a video of just the last part, so let’s upload it right away! And then share it on social media! I’ll reply immediately!” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Even though it’s about me, it feels like I’m being left out of the loop.</p>



<p>But since Yuki and Sana were urging me to do it quickly, I reluctantly followed their instructions. By the way, we all agreed on the title “[God-tier Plays] Soloing the Boss in Campaign Mode” but there was some debate over whether to include the “[God-tier Plays]” part. In the end, the other three’s opinions won out, but seriously, putting that in the title feels like overrating myself. …Well, I am proud of the video itself though.</p>



<p>“…Yep, I’ve uploaded it to YouTube. I also posted on social media—wait, replies already!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As soon as I posted on social media promoting the video, I received immediate replies from Yuki, Mariel-sama, and Sana’s accounts. It seems like they were all prepared with their phones. That was fast.</p>



<p>“Oh, they’re already responding.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…That’s quite the momentum. The views are skyrocketing.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, it’s Kei’s video, so it’s only natural.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>It felt somewhat strange seeing everyone so delightedly checking social media and YouTube as if it were about themselves. When I pointed this out, I received the response “It’s natural because it’s our oshi” from all three.</p>



<p>“It’s only natural to be happy when your oshi’s reputation improves.  And besides, seeing the game happen live right in front of us, it’s only natural to get excited.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika said this proudly for some reason, but well, I can understand that feeling.</p>



<p>“Um, Kei-kun, do you… want to see your oshi doing her best?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Yuki timidly asked.</p>



<p>I replied “Of course”, but I tilted my head wondering why she was asking that.</p>



<p>“Well, Kei-kun supports us too, right? It makes me happy, but it also feels a bit underwhelming that I couldn’t show you at my best…” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“You mean your idol activities? If that’s the case, I always watch it on TV or in videos.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“No, I meant that I wanted you to see it up close like earlier. Watching you through a screen is cool, but seeing you play in person was really cool. I just thought it’d be nice if I could do the same for you…” (Yuki)</p>



<p>I’d rather you refrain from constantly calling me “cool” because it seriously makes me blush… But I see, I understand what you’re trying to say.</p>



<p>Certainly, I’d like to see my oshi in action up close. For Yuki, I can go to concerts and such, but to see it up close… well, that’s impossible.</p>



<p>“Oh, I know!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>At that moment, Yuki suddenly seemed to have an idea and grabbed my arm, starting to walk. When I asked what was going on, she just urged me to hurry up. With no other choice, I followed Yuki, while Serika and Sana followed behind us.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>“Is this… an arcade?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>We arrived at a different floor of the same building, which turned out to be the game corner. It was quite spacious, with many game machines surrounding us.</p>



<p>“If it’s games you want, couldn’t we have just stayed at the café earlier? Unlike here, we have it all rented out for ourselves.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika’s observation was correct, but Yuki said that she could only do it here. Eventually, it seemed she found what she was looking for, as she headed towards a large machine for a dance game.</p>



<p>“This is it! I’ll be playing this, so Kei-kun, I want you to watch me.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s fine, but… why?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Sorry for the sudden request. I want to show a good side of myself to Kei-kun too… Besides, I’ve done this before, and I’m pretty good at dancing.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>With that said, as Yuki stepped onto the platform, we decided to stand around and watch.</p>



<p>I was taken aback by the suddenness of it all, but deep down, I was quite excited to see Yuki’s dance live (albeit in a game). However, as she selected the song and the game began, the atmosphere around her changed.</p>



<p>Yuki energetically raised her hands and struck a pose.</p>



<p>Of course, such movements weren’t necessary as the game’s outcome was determined solely by tapping on the panel at her feet. Yet, in that moment, the arcade transformed into a pseudo-live stage.</p>



<p>The playful demeanor she had shown just moments ago disappeared somewhere, and in its place stood the cool and artistic idol, Yuki.</p>



<p id="imagetext">Yuki danced vividly to the rhythm of the music. I was quickly absorbed by her overwhelming performance and could only stare at her in awe.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing the extraordinary presence, a crowd of onlookers quickly gathered around us.</p>



<p>“Wow…!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“That’s so cool…!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Hey, is she a pro?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Mom, that lady is amazing!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“She’s beautiful…” (Audience)</p>



<p>“She’s like a goddess…!” (Audience)</p>



<p>Amidst the shower of praise from everyone, Yuki proceeded to complete the song with flawless steps.</p>



<p>With an all-perfect high score, cheers and excitement echoed throughout the store.</p>



<p>“…So, what did you think? Did I live up to your expectations?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After finishing the game, Yuki asked without even breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>I overwhelmed with emotion, could only nod silently in response. Seeing that, Yuki smiled happily and said, “Hehe, I’m glad…” The combination of her emotions and cuteness almost overwhelmed me to the point where I felt like rolling around on the floor right there.</p>



<p>“Wow… that was amazing.” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Hey, doesn’t she look kinda like Yuki?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Yuki as in the idol?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Uhh, let’s change locations for now…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>But just as we were about to talk, we noticed the crowd discussing such things, and even though we were in disguise with hats and glasses, drawing attention was not a good idea. So, we decided to move to a quieter place.</p>



<p>“No, seriously, that was amazing…! Your dancing was beyond what you’d expect from a game…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Taking a moment to catch my breath, I expressed my admiration once again. The fact that Yuki was a top idol had been directly hammered into me, right before my eyes.</p>



<p>“Ehehe, thank you… I worked hard so as not to embarrass myself in front of you, so I’m glad to hear that.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki showed a satisfied smile. Despite effortlessly gathering such a crowd and displaying her innate idol power, she remained humble. It made me realize once again how amazing it was to have someone like her supporting me.</p>



<p>“Ketaro, come with me for a moment!” (Serika)</p>



<p>At that moment, Serika, who had been quiet all along, stepped forward with a somewhat dissatisfied expression.</p>



<p>“What’s up? I’m still basking in the afterglow–” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Just come here!” (Serika)</p>



<p>And so, I found myself being dragged around by Serika.</p>



<p>While wondering what was going on, we headed to the rhythm game corner, where Serika stood in front of a game machine.</p>



<p>“Y-You’re my oshi too, right? Then I have no choice but to show off my skills too!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, it’s not like you have to…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I can’t let Yuki Nozomi have all the spotlight! I won’t allow it!” (Serika)</p>



<p>It seemed like Serika was trying to compete with Yuki by showing off her skills. Well, regardless of whatever she’s doing right now, my devotion to Mariel-sama wouldn’t change. Besides, a rhythm game… wait a minute? When it comes to rhythm games…</p>



<p>“Just watch me…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika started the game with overflowing enthusiasm. It was a game where you touch icons on the screen in rhythm with the music, but the quantity and speed were staggering. Even to the casual observer, the high difficulty level was apparent.</p>



<p>However, Serika effortlessly handled it with graceful hand movements. She kept hitting perfect after perfect notes without a single miss. As I watched in astonishment, something clicked in my mind.</p>



<p>…That’s right, when it comes to rhythm games, Mariel-sama once did a livestream endurance challenge attempting to achieve a perfect run of all songs, but she cleared it so quickly that it went viral.</p>



<p>With her cute voice, skilled gameplay, and entertaining commentary, combined with her outstanding sense of rhythm, the immensely popular VTuber, Daitenin Mariel, had it all. Seeing her real-life counterpart showcasing those skills in front of me, I could do nothing but admire her.</p>



<p>“Wow…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p id="no1">“I’m just getting started…! <a href="#footnote">This isn’t even my final form<sup>1</sup></a>!” (Serika)</p>



<p>She’s starting to sound like Mariel-sama, but Serika herself doesn’t seem to notice it, as she remains focused on the game.</p>



<p>“This is it <em>desu wa</em>!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Once she finished playing, Serika turned around with plenty of confidence.</p>



<p>On the game screen visible from behind her, the words “All Perfect” were prominently displayed.</p>



<p>“Hehe, I’m quite confident in my sense of rhythm. I’ve studied various games, but this is the one I’m best at after all. What do you think, Ketaro? This is the true power of Daitenin Mariel <em>desu wa</em>.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Uh, yeah, it was amazing. A masterpiece, but…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s because of the excitement of achieving a perfect run, but Serika’s tone hadn’t returned to normal, leaving me unsure of how to react despite feeling delighted to have witnessed Mariel-sama’s play firsthand.</p>



<p>Could it be that she switches into Mariel-sama mode whenever she’s playing rhythm games? While pondering this, Serika smiled contentedly, took out her smartphone, and started taking pictures of the game screen.</p>



<p>As I wondered what she was up to, a notification popped up on my phone saying that Mariel-sama had just posted on her social media account. </p>



<p>It was the same picture she had just taken a moment ago, and it was receiving an overwhelming number of replies. As expected of Mariel-sama…</p>



<p>“Hey, isn’t this the one Mariel-sama just posted?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Seriously? Let’s give it a try!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, didn’t we hear a voice that sounded like Mariel-sama’s earlier?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s just our imagination?” (Audience)</p>



<p>Voices from behind made me stiffen in surprise.</p>



<p>W-Were they listening?! Did they already see the post?! Sensing danger, I quickly led everyone back to a less crowded area.</p>



<p>“Hehe, being an influencer sure is tough, huh?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Finally, Serika’s tone returned to normal.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but think she should be more careful of the situation, but Serika remained in high spirits, unfazed by it all.</p>



<p>“……Muuu.” (Sana)</p>



<p>This time, Sana, who had been quiet all along, suddenly tugged at my clothes.</p>



<p>When I asked what was wrong, she looked up at me with a displeased expression. </p>



<p>“Sana wants to impress Onii-chan too.” (Sana)</p>



<p>While sending occasional glances towards Yuki and Serika, she expressed her feelings as such.</p>



<p>“I’ve told you, even without doing something like that, I already know you’re an amazing cosplayer, and my feelings won’t change—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…But Sana wants to show it too. It’s not fair.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana said while still gazing at the two. Despite that, I couldn’t help but think that she didn’t need to get so competitive. Nevertheless, Sana grabbed my hand and started walking.</p>



<p>“W-Where are we going?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Sana wants to dance too. Let’s give it a try.” (Serika)</p>



<p>With those words, we headed to the dancing machine that Yuki had played earlier.</p>



<p>…Wait, is Sana actually good at dancing? I’ve never seen her dance before…</p>



<p>As I watched with a mixture of doubt and curiosity, Sana, unusually determined, climbed onto the platform. And when she started playing and dancing, I was amazed.</p>



<p>“……Mm, …Mmm!” (Serika)</p>



<p>…H-Her movements couldn’t be more uncoordinated!</p>



<p>Watching her desperately trying to follow the steps while alternating between the screen and her feet, it was obvious that she was struggling. Still, Sana’s earnest efforts reminded me of a determined child…</p>



<p>…What’s this feeling? Sana has always been cute, but right now, she’s cute in a completely different way!? It’s like she’s stirring up my desire to protect her…!</p>



<p>“Wow…!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“What’s that, it’s so cute…!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Oh, isn’t that cute?” (Audience)</p>



<p>“Mom, that girl is trying so hard!” (Audience)</p>



<p>“What a beautiful girl!” (Audience)</p>



<p>Before I knew it, a crowd had gathered again, but this time, they were buzzing with a different kind of excitement, unlike Yuki.</p>



<p>Why do I suddenly feel the urge to brag about my sister?</p>



<p>“Ugh…” (Sana)</p>



<p>When Sana returned after finishing the game, her expression clearly showed dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I felt strangely fulfilled. …No, I was satisfied.</p>



<p>“Ugh… that was bad…” (Sana)</p>



<p>“No, you did great. It just made me want to support you even more.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Sana’s not happy about it. It’s unfair without cosplay. <em>Muu</em>!” (Sana)</p>



<p>“That’s not true! Sana-chan, you were cute!” (Nozomi) </p>



<p>“That was something… I recorded a video of it, but do you want to upload it?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Encouraged by Serika, Sana reluctantly uploaded the video of her dancing to her own social media account while wearing a dissatisfied expression. But in no time, the responses flooded in, all praising her cuteness.</p>



<p>…Yeah, as her brother, I’m totally satisfied. Even if she’s still feeling dissatisfied herself.</p>



<p>“Good work! I’m glad everyone was able to show Kei-kun their good side.” (Nozomi) </p>



<p>Yuki said that while smiling and looking around at everyone.</p>



<p>To this, Serika replied, “Indeed,” and Sana, still somewhat dissatisfied, nodded in agreement.</p>



<p>While I didn’t need them to show me anything special to support them, I couldn’t deny that I felt even more inclined to support them after today. In that sense, I couldn’t help but feel like I fell right into Yuki’s plan.</p>



<p>Feeling a bit embarrassed by that, I changed the subject while looking at my phone.</p>



<p>“…But seriously, the response to Mariel-sama and Sana’s posts is amazing. Yuki might not be able to upload to social media, but if she did, it would surely attract the same amount of attention. Influencers sure are something, huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I said this with a sense of emotion. Being supported by such amazing people, it’s no wonder I still feel like this is all somewhat unreal.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about? You’re a hugely popular gaming commentator now.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s all thanks to you guys. But before that, I hardly got any reactions.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Comparing my channel now and then is like comparing day and night. It’s not even close.</p>



<p>“I mean, back then, even just one comment would get me all excited.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, I’ve been checking Kei-kun’s social media and commenting on his streams and videos for a long time!” </p>



<p>Yuki raised her hand while speaking. Her gesture was so cute, especially compared to her usual cool demeanor.</p>



<p>“Yeah, Wankoromochi-san’s comments always cheered me up. Thanks to them, I was motivated to keep doing commentaries.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“K-Kei-kun…! Ehehehe…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki blushed and covered her cheeks with her hands. Well, I didn’t even know those comments were from Yuki back then.</p>



<p>“I-I’ve been checking out Ketaro’s streams all along too! I might not have left any comments… but! I remember every single detail of your videos perfectly!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Now it was Serika who chimed in. She crossed her arms as if trying to compete with Yuki but trying to one-up her like that wasn’t necessary.</p>



<p>“…Well, Sana’s the same. She’s been watching Onii-chan’s YouTube videos too.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh, really?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Sana joined in, but I couldn’t help but ask back. That’s news to me? You were watching my streams all along?</p>



<p>“So that’s how it is! Even Sana-chan…! So basically, Kei-kun’s our oshi, which makes us ‘oshi buds’!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…Well, I guess so, but was there even such a term?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Well, leaving aside Yuki’s habit of making up words, I get what she’s trying to say.</p>



<p>“<em>Fuwa</em>, I’m so happy…! I’ve never met fellow Kei-kun fans before, and now that I’ve become friends with Serika-san, and even Sana-chan…! From now on, we can all have lots of talks about Kei-kun together!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but be mesmerized by Yuki’s genuinely happy smile.</p>



<p>To think that I could see such an amazing smile and to think that she was doing it while talking about me…</p>



<p>I’m definitely in a position where I should be the one offering thanks. Maybe I should just buy more Yuki merchandise for now.</p>



<p>As I pondered such things, Yuki and the others started getting heated up talking about me, or rather, having an oshi talk, as they call it.</p>



<p>They were eagerly discussing things like what happened in that one stream, or in that particular video. It’s a bit uncomfortable hearing them talk about me like that, but it’s clear they really do support me.</p>



<p>…But when it comes to being an ‘oshi’, I’m not backing down either, you know? Just like how you’re supporting me, I’ll support you all even more from now on! However, I’ll have to think about the specifics later.</p>



<p>As I fueled this mysterious sense of rivalry, I suddenly noticed a tense atmosphere in the air. And the source of it… well, obviously, there were only the four of us here: me, Yuki, Serika, and Sana.</p>



<p>Wait, what’s going on? Where did the relaxed atmosphere we had just moments ago disappear to?</p>



<p>“I still think the best version of Kei-kun is the Kei-kun during his streams. Oh, but the Kei-kun at school is also pretty irresistible. The Kei-kun at school—” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Hmm? But aren’t you just scratching the surface with that? I think you really need to know the old Ketaro to appreciate the good points of the current Ketaro. Come to think of it, back when we were kids, these kinds of things—” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…You haven’t seen each other much in recent years, right? As a family member, Sana knows his gap the best. Onii-chan at home—” (Sana)</p>



<p>It seems like they’re discussing which kind of me they support the most, each talking about their own version, but… is it me or do they look like they’re subtly competing for something else? Maybe it’s just my imagination, but can we please stop this potential argument?</p>



<p>“Um… It’s really nice that you all support me, but, um, it’s a bit uncomfortable when you… you know, argue like this…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I timidly interject. Please don’t say something like “how pathetic”. Approaching a group of girls like this is seriously a courageous act, you know!? Especially for an introvert like me!</p>



<p>“Eh? What are you talking about, Kei-kun? We’re not arguing, are we?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Yeah, what’s with you? We’re just chatting normally.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Please don’t misunderstand. We’re just having a friendly chat about our oshi.” (Sana)</p>



<p>…Well, they say that, but their smiles don’t quite reach their eyes. It’s like I can hear ominous background music playing…! In the end, I couldn’t find an opportunity to intervene, and the discussion (??) continued.</p>



<p>It’s still unsettling, but it doesn’t seem like anything bad is about to happen, so for now, it seems like all I can do is watch over.</p>



<p>Since I had nothing to do, I decided to pass the time by checking the reactions to the videos and posts I put up earlier until their talk was over.</p>



<p>Regarding the video on the solo boss win, most of the comments were positive, like “amazing” or “impressive,” which was nice to see, but there were also a few negative ones that caught my eye.</p>



<p>Some comments were dismissive from the start, saying it’s impossible to do solo, while others laughed it off, saying it’s not a big deal and that other players could also do it. There were even comments implying that they were better at the game, which made me amused, but then there were others accusing me of cheating.</p>



<p>“…Nono, it’s definitely not a cheat. You can tell if someone’s using cheats just by looking.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at the low-level comments.</p>



<p>But then, at that moment, everyone who had been chatting lively just a moment ago suddenly stopped and turned their attention towards me all at once. It seemed they reacted to my muttering, but the intensity of it made me flinch. </p>



<p>“…What did you just say, Kei-kun? Cheating…?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“N-No, I just saw a comment stating that earlier…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika quickly takes out her phone to check. Yuki and Sana follow suit.</p>



<p>“Haaaaaa!? What is this comment!? There’s no way Ketaro would cheat! Who does this damn commenter think he is, accusing him of something like that?!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika gets infuriated as she reads the comment. …That’s not exactly the language one would expect from a young lady (<em>ojou-sama</em>)!?</p>



<p>“…This is terrible. There’s no way Kei-kun would cheat. It’s unforgivable to write something like this, even though it should be obvious just by watching…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki suddenly returns to her usual cool demeanor and expresses her anger quietly. Her cold and quiet tone made her anger apparent and I couldn’t help but let out a gasp of fear.</p>



<p>“…Who are these losers? Insulting Onii-chan like that is the worst. They should just die.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana, in her usual energetic manner, expressed the most extreme sentiment. It’s reassuring that she’s angry on my behalf, but I wish she could be a bit gentler.</p>



<p>Well, each of them has their own way of expressing it, but it seems like everyone is outraged by this comment. And even though they were arguing just a moment ago, now they’re all united in roasting this commenter. What a contrast.</p>



<p>“We won’t let these haters win. Let’s keep promoting Kei-kun’s good points from now on!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s right. There’s no point in trying to deal with haters, so let’s just ignore them and keep boosting Ketaro up!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Agreed. Haters have no right to speak. Everyone should become believers of onii-chan.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“As members of the Kei-kun’s oshi alliance, let’s join forces from now on. For starters, let’s share information about Kei-kun among ourselves. I’ll be in charge of gathering information about Kei-kun at school.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Yeah, then I’ll provide information about Ketaro from when he was a kid.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Sana will give details about Onii-chan at home.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Thank you, Sana-chan. Oh, and Sana-chan, we need to add you to our messaging group.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>And before I knew it, a mysterious alliance had been formed. …What on earth just happened?</p>



<p>I don’t think anything good will happen if I say something, so I decided to refrain from commenting on this matter, even though it’s related to me.</p>



<p>…But honestly, there’s no need to get worked up over such comments.</p>



<p>As someone from a generation that has been connected to the internet since birth, I know that comments like these are just part of the daily routine, and they don’t faze me that much.</p>



<p>Yes, if there’s anything that would unsettle me, it wouldn’t be comments like these.</p>



<p>I checked the comments section again. And as I scrolled through, my finger stopped at a particular comment.</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [This guy’s been getting a lot of attention from celebrities lately, but isn’t he getting carried away?]</p>



<p>An empty, low-level comment akin to a thug’s baseless accusation.</p>



<p>Normally, there would be no need to pay it any mind. And as evidence, this comment had neither likes nor dislikes. In essence, it was just a mere complaint.</p>



<p>…However, comments like these hit me the hardest right now. It’s a fact that I only reached where I’m at because of Yuki, Mariel-sama, and Sana giving me exposure. That’s why I need to work even harder from now on—</p>



<p>“Hmm?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I pondered these thoughts, I felt a gaze upon me and lifted my head to meet Yuki’s eyes.</p>



<p>But the gaze was quickly averted, and Yuki resumed the conversation as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>It was just a momentary glance, but it seemed like there was some uncertainty in those eyes. Or was that just my imagination…?</p>

<p><em>Yuki danced vividly to the rhythm of the music. I was quickly absorbed by her overwhelming performance and could only stare at her in awe.</em></p>

<li><a href="#no1">Ok so the actual translation is something along the lines of “The true power of Daitenin Mariel has yet to be revealed” but it is done in Mariel-sama’s desu wa tone. The word “desu wa” wasn’t actually used so idk how to translate it and I thought if that’s the case, I might as well throw in a joke.</a></li>
