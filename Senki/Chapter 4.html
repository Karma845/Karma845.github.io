<h2>Chapter 4 At Times, People Harbor Desires So Strong That They’re Willing to Sacrifice Their Own Future to Achieve Them</h2>

<p>And on the day of the warning, at 7 o’clock in the evening…</p>
<p>“It certainly feels intense.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Everyone seems quite tense.”</p>
<p>As we entered the magic museum’s grounds in a carriage as usual, each of us expressed our thoughts on the scene of numerous security magicians with alert eyes.</p>
<p>In front of the museum, on the main square, several magicians holding magic keys were standing, their gaze sharp and full of hostility. An eerie tension hung in the air, and their eyes showed strong vigilance. Even as our carriage entered the premises, everyone pointed their magic keys at us simultaneously.</p>
<p>It was commendable that they maintained their attitude towards the given mission and remained highly vigilant. However, aiming hostility at a carriage that Princess Krell is on was too disrespectful. I rotated my Guardian Shield Key and countered the hostility with a dense release of mana. The momentarily intimidated magicians looked at us from the window, and I gave them a nod of acknowledgment, and they straightened their backs, saluting, and returned to their duties.</p>
<p>By demonstrating an insurmountable difference in strength and providing reassurance that an absolute powerhouse stood by their side, I relieved the tension and allowed them to relax. If they remain too tense and cautious, they won’t be able to perform at their best when it really matters. There are still two hours left until the time of the warning, and if they stay tense from this early, they’ll get exhausted. I was complimenting myself on having deftly eased their tension when… Princess Krell, who was sitting next to me, lightly tapped my head.</p>
<p>“Don’t scare them.”</p>
<p>“I merely demonstrated the difference in our strengths. Just by considering that an overwhelmingly powerful ally is with them, it should ease their minds, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, it might be, but… Can you be gentler about it? Oh well, let’s consider your warning as just a gesture. For you, this is gentle, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course, milady. There’s no bloodshed involved.”</p>
<p>“You have such a scary way of thinking. Anyway…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell paused for a moment, then looked at the seat where she was sitting.</p>
<p>“Why are you sitting next to me today? You usually sit on the opposite side.”</p>
<p>That question was one of the thirteen questions I expected to be asked. Right now, Princess Krell and I were sitting side by side on the same seat in the carriage, and our shoulders were almost touching.</p>
<p>I made my Guardian Shield Key disappear from my right hand and answered.</p>
<p>“I was poisoned when we were sitting face to face at the restaurant before. To prevent that from happening again, I decided to stay closer to protect you.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to get this close, though…”</p>
<p>“That was what I thought, and I got tricked.”</p>
<p>I think I had been overconfident.</p>
<p>When it comes to protection, there’s no one better than me. Breaking through my defense and harming Princess Krell is impossible. That’s how I had thought, and as a result, I was almost served with poison mixed into my food. It could have led to losing my precious Lady.</p>
<p>I deeply reflected on my actions, reevaluated my abilities, and considered what I should do to ensure this doesn’t happen again. Finally, I came to the conclusion that if I stayed closer to Princess Krell than before, I could sense danger earlier.</p>
<p>When I came up with this idea, I couldn’t help but praise myself, “Am I a genius?” It not only allows me to perfectly protect Princess Krell from any calamity but also lets me feel her close presence. It’s like killing two birds with one stone, as they say. I even asked God if it means that I get double the happiness, considering how well I understand Princess Krell’s beauty, magnificence, and cuteness. God should understand those things very well too, so it wouldn’t be strange for me to say such things. Or rather, it should be expected.</p>
<p>“…But still, it feels too close.”</p>
<p>“…Is it uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>I asked Princess Krell with an uneasy atmosphere, and she briefly held her breath and turned her face away.</p>
<p>“I-it’s not like I hate it! If Roth thinks it’s a good idea, then I don’t mind!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Too easy.</p>
<p>If she had been born into a kind ordinary family, she might have been deceived by a bad man by now. I have to protect her from those harmful scumbags.</p>
<p>And so, the carriage stopped, and we arrived at the back entrance of the museum.</p>
<p>Both Princess Krell and I got off the carriage and placed her in the wheelchair prepared for her, heading towards the director’s room.</p>
<p>As we passed through the corridor, many security guards briefly showed vigilance towards us, but when I raised my hand, they bowed and returned to their positions. It’s reassuring.</p>
<p>We proceeded on the path to the director’s room, which I remembered from my previous visit, and knocked on the rather grand door firmly three times. We immediately heard a response from inside, so I opened the door and entered.</p>
<p>“…I think I mentioned this before, but could you knock on the door a bit more gently, Roth-sama?”</p>
<p>“Knocking lightly might not be noticed. So, I’m making sure the director definitely notices the knock. Please appreciate my small consideration and bow your head to the floor. Right now. Go on.”</p>
<p>“Roth, this is no time for jokes, you know?”</p>
<p>“I’m being perfectly serious.”</p>
<p>“It’s even worse.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a joke, but I admit that it might be unnecessary banter at the moment.</p>

<p>Really, I wish the director would consider the time and place. That’s why his daughter hates him, you know.</p>
<p>Thinking such things, I brought the wheelchair closer to the sofa and said to the director, “Anyway, there’s quite a tense atmosphere inside the museum. I unintentionally responded with hostility when I was targeted.”</p>
<p>“Rather, it wouldn’t be right to have a light-hearted atmosphere in this situation. Everyone is capable of activating magic immediately if an intruder comes.”</p>
<p>Is that really necessary?</p>
<p>The museum has many exhibits besides the etoile Magic Key. If they recklessly cast magic spells in pursuit of intruders, it would cause quite a mess in the museum. Especially for some paintings that are not covered by glass cases. I think that’s something we can control, considering that we’ve gathered imperial palace magicians… but I still have some concerns.</p>
<p>However, the director seems to be completely unconcerned, and he continued with the conversation.</p>
<p>“By the way… I heard that you went through quite a difficult ordeal.”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you. But I’m satisfied that I was able to protect Princess Krell, and it was fortunate to confirm the presence of those impudent fools who are hostile to her. I was able to get rid of the annoying pests.”</p>
<p>“Oh… It seems like you’re highly motivated.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m fully prepared to kill. Of course.”</p>
<p>In reality, I can’t actually kill them, so it would probably just be a punch to the face.</p>
<p>“Roth. We don’t have time for idle chatter.”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>“Good grief… How’s the security situation? I know that there haven’t been any major problems so far, but what about the arrangement of each exhibition room?”</p>
<p>Princess Krell asked the director, and I couldn’t help but be impressed. Using your brain was typically my area, but it looks like Princess Krell is starting to use hers… Princess Krell turned around and gave me a sharp look.</p>
<p>“Are you thinking something rude?”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I love you, Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>“…Trying to deceive me like that…”</p>
<p>“I’m not, so rest assured. So, director?”</p>
<p>Prompted by me, the director nodded.</p>
<p>“On each floor, we have three security personnel as before. Of course, they are all magicians with a certain level of ability.”</p>
<p>“What about areas other than the floors… like the hallways and the parts connecting to the outside? It’s impossible to have Roth guarding every single passageway.”</p>
<p>“Naturally, we have personnel stationed in all areas. In case anyone breaks in, we have bells that will ring throughout the museum instantly. As for the ‘Magic Key Room,’ we have ten imperial palace magicians, three resident security guards, and Erne-kun.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Princess Krell’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Erne is on security duty?”</p>
<p>“Well, she seems to be a magician too, so it’s only reasonable.”</p>
<p>Of course, the protection of the room where the etoile Magic Key is kept is the most stringent. We also have personnel stationed in other areas, but regardless of how tight the security is, there will always be weak points. We must ensure they are not exploited.</p>
<p>“If the security is tight, then that’s fine. What remains is how strong and cunning the bastard who sent the warning letter is… but there’s no point in us trying to figure that out. We can only hope that the magicians won’t be defeated head-on.”</p>
<p>“You can’t assume the enemy is just one person, Director. There’s also a possibility that they might attack with a large group. And there are magicians who can defeat many opponents at once, like Princess Krell and me.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, you’re right.”</p>
<p>Well, I said that to the director, but it’s unlikely that magicians as powerful as Princess Krell and I will come. If someone has that kind of strength, there would be no reason for them to go through all the trouble of stealing the etoile Magic Key…</p>
<p>It’s about time.</p>
<p>“Then, we’ll be going.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Where to?”</p>
<p>As they were leaving the director’s office, pushing Princess Krell’s wheelchair, the director asked from behind. Maybe they thought they could stay here until the appointed time, but they couldn’t be so carefree.</p>
<p>Since Princess Krell had been attacked, I had decided to actively involve myself in the case.</p>
<p>“It’s decided—It’s Hyper Lovey-Dovey Time.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie!”</p>
<p>Without waiting for the director’s response, I closed the door to the director’s office.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“It’s a bit chilly, isn’t it?.”</p>
<p>After leaving the director’s office, we moved to the museum’s rooftop, and I sat on a chair exposed to the chilly night breeze. This rooftop is usually open to visitors and features famous bronze sculptures by renowned artists. From here, you can overlook the city’s illuminated streets, where lovers often visit to admire the night view and make confessions, sometimes resulting in rejections. However, today the museum was closed all day, and at this moment, only Princess Krell and I were on the rooftop. Behind the already beautiful Princess Krell, there was a picturesque night view… I felt an overwhelming urge to shout out that I love her.</p>
<p>Noticing that I was staring, Princess Krell tilted their head and asked, “Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no. I’ll make you happy, I promise.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t make a random confession.”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>I bowed my head and apologized for the confession that I couldn’t hold back. I understood how those guys who made confessions without thinking felt. But I wasn’t rejected. All the previous confessions were just casually brushed aside. Until I receive a proper answer, I will continue to dedicate words of love to Princess Krell. So, I’m different from those who were rejected.</p>
<p>Feeling superior to the men who were defeated there, I explained to Princess Krell, “It’s just that, you see, it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You, who are more beautiful than the world’s finest gem certified by a jeweler, are contemplating seriously with a stunning night view as your backdrop. It would be cruel to ask me not to whisper words of love. Besides, this is a famous confession spot. I thought you’d appreciate it more than an ordinary confession.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell turned away from me and muttered with a hint of embarrassment, covering her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>“Even the usual confessions… aren’t ordinary. They truly resonate with my heart.”</p>
<p>“I want to hold you.”</p>
<p>“W-What are you saying?! And besides, you should pretend not to hear that! In most stories, the protagonist’s confessions are often unheard, right?”</p>
<p>“Princess Krell, I apologize, but I am a man who wants to wring such a protagonist like a rag and sink them to the bottom of a river.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I don’t like people like that either, but… Wait, this isn’t the time to be talking about that! You still haven’t heard the purpose of coming here!”</p>
<p>“That’s right… The Guardian Shield Key.”</p>
<p>I summoned the magic key.</p>
<p>Having been captivated by Princess Krell—always captivated—I had forgotten. I didn’t come here to make a love confession. I came to perform the most important task.</p>
<p>“Boundary Perception.”</p>
<p>I activated the magic by forming a magic circle in front of me. Instantly, a translucent mana membrane spread throughout the entire museum from my position, covering the entire area inside the premises.</p>
<p>Sensing the faint flow of mana, Princess Krell asked,</p>
<p>“What did you do?”</p>
<p>“I used a magic to capture intruding rats. It’s called Boundary Perception. It forms an extremely thin mana membrane that covers the entire museum, and if anyone from the outside tries to penetrate it, I’ll sense it. Essentially, it makes external intrusion impossible.”</p>
<p>Anyone touching the membrane can be tracked by me, so there’s absolutely no way to escape. Moreover, it’s impossible to know the membrane’s presence in advance. Even after activating the magic, the watchful mages guarding the place continue their vigilance just like before. I don’t know if they’re highly skilled or not, but my proficiency in magic is too high.</p>
<p>“The Boundary Perception membrane is a perfect trap that even first-class mages can’t detect.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, you’re an expert in protection. It’s almost impossible to steal the etoile’s Magic Key by bypassing this defense.”</p>
<p>“…The name of the Guardian Expert would be disgraced. I couldn’t even detect such a classic poison.”</p>
<p>Oh, it seems like I’m genuinely feeling down. It’s been a while since I felt a sense of defeat or self-reproach like this. I even think it’s fitting punishment that I was tormented by the poison of the tree’s blood.</p>
<p>As I chuckled with self-mockery, Princess Krell hurriedly offered comforting words.</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t be helped! Nobody’s perfect, and it’s natural to let loose a bit in a familiar place!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Princess Krell. However, your kindness feels like rubbing salt in the wound right now.”</p>
<p>“Uh… W-well then…”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>After fidgeting for a moment, Princess Krell finally mustered the courage to stand up from the wheelchair and slowly sat down in the chair next to me. Then, pulling the chair closer, she rested their head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“How about now? Does this lift your spirits?”</p>
<p>“Now I feel like I could easily defeat all the Seventh Heaven Key mages.”</p>
<p>“That’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p>How could I not feel better when the person I love has her head resting on my shoulder like this?! I could feel Princess Krell’s body warmth and the subtle touch of her fingers, and my condition reached its peak. I felt invincible, like I could do anything.</p>

<p>This is wonderful. I should definitely continue doing this every day. Maybe I’ll even submit a paper to the Magic Society. The title will be ‘The Doki-Doki and Cuticle Perfect Healing Effect of Princess Krell, Third in Line to the Throne.’ Perfect. Researchers worldwide should bow down to Princess Krell’s magnificence after reading my paper.</p>
<p>Thinking about such things seriously, I took off my jacket and put it on Princess Krell’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“R-Roth?”</p>
<p>“You said you were cold, right? I’m a little hot, so feel free to use it.”</p>
<p>“Hot, you say?”</p>
<p>“Yes. When my emotions are high… my body temperature rises. Especially before a battle.”</p>
<p>The current temperature is low enough for Princess Krell to feel cold. The flaming star that pours its heat onto the earth has disappeared, and the cold wind is blowing, so not many people would feel hot in this situation. However… due to the excitement before the battle or something like that, my heart rate increases, and my body generates excess heat.</p>
<p>“Hurry and show yourself. Stand before me and engage in battle. I will not only seek revenge for my master’s life but also show you a hell so agonizing that you’ll regret being born.</p>
<p>I can feel the restrained emotions within my heart shouting those words in anger. To prevent the other side of me, the one that should be described as such, from surfacing, I took a deep breath to calm myself.</p>
<p>Well, no matter how well I hide it, my master seems to have seen through me.</p>
<p>As I have the closest view of her, she also has the closest view of me.</p>
<p>“You seem quite angry.”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural. Although I haven’t lost myself completely, the rage and killing intent still linger in my heart. Emotionally-driven beings cannot easily erase the feelings they once held. Even if they think they have, the embers still smolder within their hearts. What I harbor is beyond mere embers, though.”</p>
<p>“But, Roth. I…”</p>
<p>“You don’t want me to kill anyone, right?”</p>
<p>My kind-hearted master despises the idea of me taking someone’s life, even if that someone was an enemy who tried to kill her. Her kindness is both her virtue and a significant weakness. I know all too well that showing mercy can sometimes be the downfall of oneself.</p>
<p>“That’s true, but…”</p>
<p>“Just”</p>
<p>I interrupted my master’s words and placed my hand on my chest.</p>
<p>“My role is to accept my master’s wishes and fill in the gaps. You might have forgotten, but I am an extraordinarily competent butler. I can fulfill any of Princess Krell’s wishes and compensate for anything lacking.”</p>
<p>I serve my master with the readiness to accept all her weaknesses. I can grant any minor requests easily, as I am exceptionally skilled.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Princess Krell smiled and placed her hand on her mouth as if saying, ‘You are so venomously eloquent, overconfident, and mischievous, aren’t you?’</p>
<p>“That’s not all… You are also someone who loves me immeasurably. Don’t worry, with such an outstanding butler by your side… Princess Krell, you are an invincible and strongest magician.”</p>
<p>“Well, I find that reassuring. By the way… What will you do once you catch the culprit?”</p>
<p>“That’s… well…”</p>
<p>I want to kill them! I want to say, but it’s not something Princess Krell desires, so I dismiss that idea. That means inflicting a living hell upon them.</p>
<p>“Shall we try putting powdered chili peppers in their nose? Of course, in copious amounts.”</p>
<p>“That sounds quite painful…”</p>
<p>“For a heinous criminal like them, it’s only fitting. Either way, they will probably end up on the guillotine, even if I don’t take any action.”</p>
<p>Assassination attempts on royalty result in an automatic death sentence. Without me doing anything, the captured culprit will undoubtedly meet the guillotine after the trial.</p>
<p>As I glanced at my wristwatch, I noticed that there was less than an hour left until the scheduled time… yet there was no response from the boundary detection.</p>
<p>“We still have time. Could they be coming at the last minute?”</p>
<p>“No, that would be too late.”</p>
<p>I explained to Princess Krell, who seemed a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>“They are not just going there and coming back. They need to infiltrate the museum, avoid surveillance from numerous magicians, and reach their target location to steal etoile’s key by 9 o’clock, as stated in the warning. That means they need to complete the intrusion into the museum and head towards the ‘Key Chamber’ at least an hour before the scheduled time.”</p>
<p>“So, are they lying about targeting etoile’s key?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Since they have already initiated an attack, it’s clear that they genuinely intend to take the key. But…”</p>
<p>I told her my speculation, which I believe to be the most likely scenario based on various situations and evidence.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“It’s strange, though.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s strange because I heard from the museum director that all security systems were checked. Certainly, there doesn’t seem to be any change in etoile’s key.”</p>
<p>While the magicians in the room double-checked the other keys just in case, they found no changes. Everything seemed to be fine.</p>
<p>Then, the lights in the museum suddenly went out, and a bell rang violently, shaking our eardrums.</p>
<p>“――They’re here.”</p>
<p>“Hurry――kyaa!”</p>
<p>I lifted Princess Krell, floating the wheelchair with magic, and rushed down the spiral staircase.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the ‘Key Chamber’ wasn’t too far from the rooftop, so we could arrive in about a minute. In my mind, I recalled the museum’s layout as we rushed forward.</p>
<p>Although the museum was dark, we didn’t rely on our sight. We could perceive the location and obstacles through sound and the flow of air. It was a skill that was second nature to a butler.</p>
<p>Maintaining the highest possible speed, it took less than a minute to arrive at our destination.</p>
<p>At that moment, the lights in the museum were restored, and the sound of bells subsided.</p>
<p>―― Ah, they’ve come.</p>
<p>I expressed my gratitude, and all the magicians on the scene split open, creating a path. Princess Krell’s presence played a significant role, but the key of protection I was holding also had an impact. The sixth-heaven key was so powerful that it could intimidate lower-ranking magicians just by its appearance.</p>
<p>Walking effortlessly along the open path, we stopped under the gaze of a familiar woman.</p>
<p>“Erne-san, what triggered the alarm just now?”</p>
<p>I asked Erne, who was holding a small key. She tilted her head and replied.</p>
<p>“I wonder if it was a false alarm…?”</p>
<p>“A false alarm?”</p>
<p>“It’s strange. I heard from the museum director that all security systems were checked… but indeed, there doesn’t seem to be any change in etoile’s key.”</p>
<p>The glass case in the center of the room contained etoile’s key, and there were no visible changes to its appearance. For good measure, the other keys were also checked by the magicians present, but no differences were found, and they gave the all-clear sign.</p>
<p>So, why did the alarm go off, and why did all the lights in the museum go out?”</p>
<p>As I continued to gaze at the etoile Magical Key in the glass case, someone rushed into the ‘Chamber of the Magical Keys’ with hurried footsteps.</p>
<p>“The etoile Magical Key—is it!?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Finally, Director, you’re late!”</p>
<p>Erne waved at the museum director, who came rushing in. As he confirmed that the etoile Magical Key was still in its place inside the glass case, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I solemnly asked the museum director, who was breathing heavily with his hands on his knees, in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“Director, why did the alarm system go off? I heard that you had thoroughly checked everything in advance to prevent any false alarms.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did it perfectly. I repeated the inspection three times recently to avoid any possibility of a false alarm. There were no elements that could trigger it.”</p>
<p>“So… does that mean someone deliberately set off the alarm?”</p>
<p>Princess Krell tilted her head as she spoke.</p>
<p>Certainly, that possibility is worth considering. It’s possible that someone accidentally touched the glass case, dropped a magical key, or caused some other disturbance. However, all the security mages on duty should have been informed about what would trigger the alarm, making such mistakes questionable. It’s unlikely to be the case.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps—”</p>
<p>As I reached for the protective shield key and began to speak—</p>
<p>A loud voice and footsteps could be heard from near the door.</p>
<p>“Stay put!”</p>
<p>“Mmmmmm!”</p>
<p>All attention was drawn to the scene unfolding at the door of the ‘Chamber of the Magical Keys,’ where a young man in black clothing was being restrained by the security mages. He was struggling desperately to break free, but against skilled mages, he was completely powerless and incapacitated.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the moment of capturing the intruder.</p>
<p>As the guards relaxed slightly, the museum director approached the man and the mages.</p>
<p>“Who is this man?”</p>
<p>“We apprehended him as he crawled out through the ventilation. He’s probably the one who was targeting the etoile Magical Key.”</p>
<p>The mage explained, and the museum director rubbed his chin in thought.</p>
<p>“Hmm, when he was apprehended, did he touch any other glass cases with exhibits?”</p>
<p>“We tried to prevent that, but he might have.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case… then that might be the reason for the alarm.”</p>
<p>The museum director diverted his gaze from the man who was now crawling on the floor and gave instructions.</p>
<p>“Keep him restrained and take him to the locked staff room. Make sure to have someone monitoring him. Erne, you’re in charge of informing the knights.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“It’s still before the scheduled time, but just in case, I want others to stay on guard on each floor until one hour after the scheduled time. We can’t assume the thief is acting alone, and there’s a possibility he could be a decoy.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>Each of them left the ‘Chamber of the Magical Keys’ to return to their positions. Relief was evident on their faces after successfully capturing the culprit. It’s understandable that they would let their guard down a bit after anticipating a much more prolonged and challenging search.</p>
<p>Ah, how easy it would be if it ended here.</p>
<p>I thought that, but reality is not as straightforward as pulling a thread.</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>I muttered in a low voice and pressed a hidden red switch on the wall.</p>
<p>Immediately after the ear-piercing alarm rang, a massive fence, about three meters high, appeared around the glass case containing the etoile Magical Key. The mages who had left the room hastily returned, looking bewildered and clamoring as they stared at the sudden fence.</p>
<p>I warned them not to move, and Princess Krell and I approached the person trapped inside the fence.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s have a review… Erne.”</p>
<p>“Could you please stop interrupting me, Princess Krell? Can’t you leave the following questions and deductions to me?”</p>
<p>“Can’t I show off a little bit?!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to show off, as you’re already adorable.”</p>
<p>After gently patting the head of the show-offish young lady, I turned my intense gaze to Erne inside the fence.</p>
<p>She initially showed a startled reaction when our eyes met, but soon she regained her composure and smiled.</p>
<p>“Um… Roth-san? What on earth is happening?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes. It’s understandable that you’re confused by this sudden turn of events. I’m sure your heart rate has increased. I can see a faint sheen of sweat on your skin. It shouldn’t be hot enough to cause sweating right now, right?”</p>
<p>As I pointed at her forehead, Erne nervously wiped the dampness away.</p>
<p>Now then, let’s see if my deduction is correct and ask for the answer. Solving mysteries like this during the investigation is quite enjoyable, and I’m eager to know the truth.</p>
<p>“Wh-What are you doing?! Are you in your right mind, Roth-sama!”</p>
<p>The museum director, filled with anger and concern over the sudden confinement of a valuable and trusted subordinate, approached me, and I stopped him by holding up the protective shield key.</p>
<p>“Shut up, I’m going to hear the explanation, so be quiet.”</p>
<p>Without giving the director a glance, I fixed my intense gaze on Erne inside the fence and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>“Shall we explain step by step? On the first day we visited the museum, I heard about the etoile Magical Key from the museum director. Based on that, I deduced that the person who sent the threat letter must be someone from the museum staff. The ability attributed to the etoile Magical Key, known as ‘Dissonance,’ seems to contain information that only insiders would know. So, assuming someone was targeting that ability, it naturally leads to the museum staff.”</p>
<p>“…Even so, I don’t think that’s enough reason to suspect me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain that too, so listen quietly.”</p>
<p>I slammed the fence, forcefully silencing her.</p>
<p>No need to be polite anymore. Acting or not, it felt deeply unsettling and unpleasant to maintain a respectful attitude towards such a scumbag.</p>
<p>“The second time was when we revisited the museum. When we met in the director’s office, you had a bandage on your finger. You said you cut it during the restoration of the portrait stone of King Naft II.”</p>
<p>“And what’s wrong with that? People who haven’t done it wouldn’t understand, but injuries are common during restoration work.”</p>
<p>“I’m not denying the injury itself. But—”</p>
<p>Recalling that scene, I glanced at Erne’s fingertip.</p>
<p>“The border between the bandage and the skin was red and swollen. If it was just a simple cut, it wouldn’t have swollen up to the second joint. Especially not immediately after the cut.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“After that, when we left the museum and went to the reserved restaurant, Princess Krell had a dish poisoned with tree sap. The waiter was the one who laced it with poison, but I thought about where that poison might have come from. The person who asked the waiter to poison the dish would have access to tree sap. That’s when I remembered your red, swollen finger.”</p>
<p>“…You said it was a restaurant, but you mean a restaurant in the museum.”</p>
<p>While glaring at me and maintaining a defiant attitude, Erne questioned me.</p>
<p>“Assuming I were the culprit, how would I have identified the restaurant you two were going to? I haven’t heard anything from either of you, and from the day I received the threat letter until today, I’ve been shuttling between home and the museum. I don’t even go out on weekends—”</p>
<p>“Pigeons.”</p>
<p>Interrupting Erne’s words, I made my point, and she repeated in surprise.</p>
<p>“Pigeons?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I nodded and explained.</p>
<p>“The day after our first visit to the museum, Princess Krell and I were taking a stroll around a museum located a little away from Mifras… That’s when we encountered an unusual pigeon. It was a pigeon accustomed to humans, with a ring on its leg.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I recalled the pigeon we encountered in the woods.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn’t think much about it and was just thinking about how adorable Princess Krell was, wanting to marry her, and so on… But looking back, there were quite a few strange points that made me suspicious.</p>
<p>“Pigeons used in the girly ritual of receiving a ring from a future partner usually use wild pigeons not accustomed to humans. However, that pigeon was clearly used to people, and for some reason, it came to the secluded woods, where there are few people and it’s dangerous for pigeons living in the wild.”</p>
<p>Wild pigeons living in nature tend to avoid forests with many natural predators and prefer to fly around safe human areas. Using a domesticated pigeon in a place with few people would not only fail to deliver the ring but also expose the pigeon to danger of being attacked and eaten.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that someone attempting a ritual forbidden by law would be unaware of this fact.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we were so close to the pigeon that we noticed its existence… precisely when I was talking to Princess Krell about the restaurant. I clearly mentioned the date and location of our visit.”</p>
<p>It’s almost too perfect for it to be a coincidence. Moreover, after gathering the necessary information, the pigeon flew away shortly after playfully interacting with Princess Krell.</p>
<p>Considering all this, it’s possible to assume that the pigeon was a familiar-like entity, visiting us under orders to gather the information the caster needed.</p>
<p>As I continued speaking, Erne’s sweating increased. Her fingertips were trembling slightly, and if you listened carefully, you could hear her heavy breathing.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn’t show any mercy.</p>
<p>Concealing the surging exhilaration in my chest, I continued.</p>
<p>“The tree sap is a highly toxic poison that can enter the body through skin contact. However, due to the nature of the poison, if exposed to temperatures over seventy degrees Celsius for two minutes, the toxin will decompose. So, even if it comes into contact with the skin, soaking the affected area in water at seventy degrees Celsius or higher for at least two minutes will break down the toxin before it spreads through the body. Skin contact takes time for the toxin to circulate. Of course, as a trade-off for neutralizing the poison, the affected area will suffer burns. There’s no way you don’t know the details of the deadly poison used to assassinate King Naft II. You accidentally touched the tree sap with your fingertips, and to break down the toxin, you immersed your finger in hot water, causing a burn… Am I correct in my assumption?”</p>
<p>Well? I crossed my arms, waiting for Erne’s response.</p>
<p>Her wandering gaze and prolonged silence were evidence enough that my assumption was correct. She must be desperately racking her brain to figure out how to get through this situation. A cornered animal will display unexpected strength. Despite having me and Princess Krell present, we couldn’t afford to let our guard down.</p>
<p>What action would she take?</p>
<p>As I made various speculations, Erne spoke up.</p>
<p>“…Yes, it’s true that I touched the tree sap and used hot water to treat my finger, but that was because I didn’t want to worry the director—”</p>
<p>“Understand the significance of me revealing the fence at this moment. Bring out the real etoile Magical Key right away.”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>This time, Erne, along with everyone else present, fell silent and looked at the magical key inside the glass case.</p>
<p>“The etoile Magical Key inside the case might appear authentic to ordinary people or inexperienced magicians. However, such childish tricks won’t work on me or Princess Krell, right, Princess?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>They clearly didn’t get it.</p>
<p>I framed Princess Krell’s cheeks with both hands, as a reminder for them to recognize my authority. In response, Erne looked at me, her expression devoid of any composure, and asked.</p>
<p>“Why do you think that the etoile Magical Key there is a fake?”</p>
<p>“The concentration of mana emitted by the magical key, the amount it contains, and the peculiar allure that averts one’s gaze are all lacking in that one. While there’s an effort to mimic the real one, creating a perfect forgery is impossible. Those well-made fakes… probably belong to the Fifth Tier. I was surprised that you have a high-level magical key, but my protective shield key is from the Sixth Tier, on par with the etoile Magical Key. Don’t underestimate a top-class magician, you third-rate trash.”</p>
<p>“You have a foul mouth, Roth.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my apologies.”</p>
<p>“Really… so, Erne, what will you do? If you still deny it…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell smiled at Erne and made a casual suggestion.</p>
<p>“Shall I demonstrate by destroying the magical key inside the glass case?”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I can easily crush it… Right, Roth?”</p>
<p>“I can shatter it like a falling raw egg.”</p>
<p>And it was true.</p>
<p>If it were in Princess Krell’s hands, it wouldn’t even take a second to destroy it. Terrifyingly enough, this adorable, charming, and beautiful young lady possessed power that all magicians feared.</p>
<p>Faced with Princess Krell’s casual words, Erne’s face turned pale, and she took several steps back.</p>


<p>If the contracted magical key were destroyed, the magician would die as well.</p>
<p>She was indirectly suggesting killing her. Facing such words with a smile, it’s understandable that she was trembling with fear. She seemed to fear Princess Krell’s words more than the threats I made.</p>
<p>“Now, what will you do?”</p>
<p>As I threw a taunting question at her, Erne clenched her fists so hard that her nails cut into her palms, and her whole body trembled as she gritted her teeth. Just then, she screamed.</p>
<p>“Why… I was so close to completing it…!”</p>
<p>In a voice that sounded like a cry of despair, Erne extended her bloody right hand toward the glass case. Instantly, the seated magical key changed shape and transferred to Erne’s right hand.</p>
<p>It had a shape resembling the wings of a bird.</p>
<p>While in disguise as the etoile Magical Key, there was no trace of the dense mana that I felt before.</p>
<p>Instead… I felt the flow of mana, a prelude to the activation of magic.</p>
<p>“Why the ‘King’ is coming out! Monstrous creatures should stay hidden!”</p>
<p>Erne frantically held the magical key in front of her and deployed over twenty spells simultaneously. The mana and performance… while not on par with the Sixth Tier Key, it was quite powerful. There was no mistake; it must be from the Fifth Tier.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Everyone, refrain from intervening!”</p>
<p>When Princess Krell’s clear voice issued instructions, all the magicians who were about to launch interception magic canceled their spells. Instead, a chorus of confusion and agitation filled the air.</p>
<p>Ignoring their voices, I stood in front of Princess Krell— in an instant.</p>
<p>“Full Wave Wind Slash!”</p>
<p>Erne screamed, and countless wind blades shot out from the deployed magic circle. The magicians, forbidden from dealing with a strike that would cut their bodies in half upon direct impact, shouted in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ugh, it’s annoying.</p>
<p>All the agitation, confusion, and doubt were unnecessary. You all should just silently listen to Princess Krell.</p>
<p>—Since I’m here, this kind of attack is pointless.</p>
<p>“Crystal Translucent Wall.”</p>
<p>The moment I chanted the spell, a crystal wall appeared in the room, towering between Erne and the magicians. The crystal wall reflected light countless times, shining brilliantly, and deflected Erne’s slash, forcing the mana particles back. Even with the power to easily cut through a human body, it meant nothing against this wall. As evidence, there wasn’t a single scratch where the slash hit, and the wall continued to shine unchanged.</p>
<p>An invincible barrier.</p>
<p>Only Princess Krell has been able to break through this wall.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell, are you injured?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever seen me get hurt when you use defensive magic?”</p>
<p>“Ugh! My apologies. I seem to have underestimated myself. Protecting someone like Princess Krell was a piece of cake.”</p>
<p>“No, you have an overinflated ego… Huh? Did you just say ‘someone like Princess Krell’?!”</p>
<p>Ignoring her cry, I looked at the magicians who were touching the crystal wall in astonishment.</p>
<p>“They… in an instant…” “Does the Sixth Tier Key have this much power?” “Monsters!” “Those two are way too lovey-dovey…”</p>
<p>All of them seemed to be aware of the difference in power and happiness. While they were capable magicians serving the empire, it couldn’t be helped. There would be no beautiful woman like Princess Krell to provide them with healing and happiness. It’s useless to be jealous, though.</p>
<p>I made the crystal wall disappear in an instant and looked down at Erne, who was squatting in bewilderment. She might have been brokenhearted after having her power difference exposed.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to tell her to surrender quietly, the museum director grabbed the fence and appealed to Erne.</p>
<p>“Erne, is it really you?”</p>
<p>Erne didn’t answer the call. However, the museum director continued unabated.</p>
<p>“I… I trusted you so much. Was the face you showed me… all a lie?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Answer me, Erne. I can’t stand the thought of you being taken away by the knights without saying anything.”</p>
<p>Cut it out. That’s what I wanted to say to the museum director, but I held it back.</p>
<p>To be frank, anything she says now is futile. Not only is she guilty of trying to steal the etoile Magical Key, but she also attempted to assassinate Princess Krell. Whatever she says here won’t change her crimes.</p>
<p>It’s cold, but the museum director’s appeal right now is just interfering with her capture.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After repeating the call several times without receiving a response, I was about to urge the museum director to step away when high laughter echoed in the room, freezing everyone in place.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>“――Ah!”</p>
<p>Amidst the heavy atmosphere of the laughter that pierced through, everyone present was taken aback. I sensed a sinister presence near Erne’s hand and pulled out a knife from my pocket. In an instant, I aimed and threw it towards the source of the presence. However, Erne’s left arm intercepted it, preventing it from reaching its target.</p>
<p>Erne, who had a knife thrust into her forearm, briefly showed a pained expression, but quickly smiled.</p>
<p>“What’s that… Haha, the Knight of the ‘King’ is a monster, huh? I knew it, you guys are an embodiment of absurdity. Just your existence alone shows that effort is useless, that anyone cannot reach a level like yours, a devil.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Even thinking of defeating me and Princess Krell is arrogant.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, you should think more about others… Oh, by the way, the man you captured was an unrelated ordinary person I hypnotized to infiltrate. So, please release him. Also, museum director? Sorry, but every face you’ve seen here was a mask, just a superficial illusion made of clay. To be honest, there’s nothing more to say now.”</p>
<p>“Erne…”</p>
<p>“However…”</p>
<p>With a grin on his face, Erne reached into his pocket and pulled out a black sphere with glowing magic circles.</p>
<p>What is this ominous atmosphere emanating from it? And what kind of power is contained in those drawn magic circles?</p>
<p>As everyone’s gaze, filled with curiosity and questions, was fixed on him, Erne pushed the real etoile’s key, stained with blood from the knife wound in his left hand, into the black sphere with a swift motion.</p>
<p>“Thank you for buying some time――Life Discord.”</p>
<p>At the moment Erne uttered those words, the sphere with etoile’s key stuck inside was covered in black mist, and a piercing dissonance started to resonate.</p>
<p>Everyone present covered their ears and bent their knees due to the unbearable noise. In the meantime, I stood beside Princess Krell, holding the key in one hand, ensuring she was safe from harm.</p>
<p>What is this unpleasant sound? It’s unlike anything I’ve heard in my entire life… an unknown sound and sensation.</p>
<p>It wrapped around my ears, causing my skin to crawl, and an indescribable discomfort… an abnormal and unpleasant sound.</p>
<p>Trying to alleviate the discomfort, I grimaced and raised both hands towards my ears.</p>
<p>――Shiver.</p>
<p>An inexplicable chill ran through my entire body.</p>
<p>What is this feeling?</p>
<p>It’s as if I’m feeling a sense of discomfort towards myself… as if my body and brain are being taken over by someone or something that is not me…</p>
<p>“――Sound Barrier Severance!”</p>
<p>Just as my body sent out a danger signal, I instantly activated a magic to block harmful external noises ―― the Sound Barrier Severance. Immediately, I felt a thin film covering my entire body, and the dissonance that had been echoing in my ears and brain disappeared. Naturally, the abnormal discomfort also vanished.</p>
<p>This is a sound I should never hear.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of effect it has, but most likely, it’s the power of the magic circle drawn on the black sphere that Erne possesses.</p>
<p>“Ughh――Aaahh!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice of agony resounded. This was followed by Princess Krell’s gasp of astonishment, and I raised my head, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“What just happened?”</p>
<p>Muttering blankly, I focused on Erne in front of me – her left arm had turned black and cracked.</p>
<p>What happened to Erne in those few seconds? She was injured by the knife, but… her forearm didn’t turn black and crack in a leaf vein pattern. Besides, it was a non-magical attack, so there shouldn’t have been any special changes even if the knife struck directly.</p>
<p>Then… could the reason for the drastic change in Erne’s arm be…?</p>
<p>“That magic just now, as a consequence?”</p>
<p>“Ha… hahaha… I guess when it comes to being the Sixth Tier Key, the pseudo-contract’s price is quite steep.”</p>
<p>With tears in the corners of her eyes and a pained expression on her face, Erne said so. Catching on to her words, I furrowed my eyebrows and asked her.</p>
<p>“A pseudo-contract, you say?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it amazing? My magic key – Chihenko Key, is a transformation key. Not only can it change its appearance into something else, but it can also transform my own mana circuit to match a specific magic key and draw out its power through a pseudo-contract.”</p>
<p>In other words, her magic key can use the power of all magic keys.</p>
<p>That is an exceptionally formidable power for a magician. Although magicians can typically only use the power of the magic key they contracted with, Erne can use the power of other magic keys while contacting with them.</p>
<p>It allows her to engage in magical battles at an overwhelming advantage, and with such power, one might even consider designating her as the Sixth Tier Key instead of the Fifth Tier Key.</p>
<p>“However…”</p>
<p>I murmured, looking at Erne’s arm again.</p>
<p>“Is that the price of that power?”</p>
<p>Great power comes with appropriate sacrifices or consequences.</p>
<p>Presumably, by forcibly forming a contract with the magic key and extracting its power, her arm’s mana circuit has become necrotic. It won’t completely disable her from using magic, but her power and the amount of mana she can contain will drastically decrease. It can be said that her life as a magician has suffered a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Normally, such an event would be cause for despair and wetting the pillow with tears… but Erne snorted as if saying she knew about it all along.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s nothing can be done now. Anyway…”</p>

<p>Erne looked down at the etoile magic key stuck into the black ball and sighed, then looked at me and Princess Krell.</p>
<p>“Maybe… it won’t work on the ‘King’ after all. Even when the sound was ringing, it didn’t seem to affect you at all.”</p>
<p>“…That sound just now—”</p>
<p>Before I could ask Erne, I noticed something.</p>
<p>“Roth, everyone’s――!”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>I looked around and realized what was happening.</p>
<p>The museum director and the magicians… everyone except Princess Krell and me was lying on the floor with vacant eyes. They were faintly moving their bodies, confirming that they were still alive. However, their condition resembled that of lifeless bodies.</p>
<p>I instantly understood that the cause of this abnormal situation was the dissonance we heard earlier. There was no other factor that could explain it.</p>
<p>And, if I organize the contents of Erne’s recent chatter in my mind… the answer becomes clear on its own.</p>
<p>“The true nature of the dissonance is the power of etoile’s key ―― ‘Discord.'”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Erne raised the black ball with the magic key stuck in it, looking pleased.</p>
<p>“The power that etoile magic key was said to possess – a top-class strength… I was half-doubting it, but it seems to be true. With this… my plan will be successfully achieved.”</p>
<p>“Your plan, you say.”</p>
<p>I watched Erne’s exchange with Princess Krell in silence. In a cold, ruthless voice I’d never heard from her before, Princess Krell spoke up.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what kind of plan this is, but… Any scheme that involves so many people and puts them in unnecessary danger cannot possibly be a decent one. It must be evil, low, and frivolous.”</p>
<p>“A frivolous plan, huh?”</p>
<p>Erne merely shrugged exaggeratedly at Princess Krell’s words. But I noticed what she couldn’t completely hide in her eyes—anger.</p>
<p>I suspect the reason behind this incident lies in that anger. I’m curious what her motive is, but… that’s a story for after she’s been incapacitated and restrained.</p>
<p>I point the tip of my guardian shield at Erne.</p>
<p>“I’m sure this is futile, but I’ll say it anyway—release everyone from the spell and throw down your weapons and surrender.”</p>
<p>“You expect me to obey?”</p>
<p>“Not in the slightest. Resistance is well within expectations—”</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>“Ngh…”</p>
<p>“Roth?”</p>
<p>Without any context, a sharp pain hit my chest. I clutch it with my hand and sink to my knees, unable to respond to Princess Krell’s call. After a beat, I feel my heartbeat through my hand. But the rhythm isn’t steady like normal—it’s erratic, chaotic, as if the pulses of my heart are churning like turbulent waves.</p>
<p>“It didn’t work on Princess Krell Carreralonde, but it sure did a number on you.”</p>
<p>“I see. What you ‘disordered’ with Disorder was… my vital processes.”</p>
<p>I stand up, still holding my chest, and speak to Erne. She looks satisfied and says “Correct!” then elaborates:</p>
<p>“Those who hear the scream of Disorder have their normal vital processes ‘disordered.’ Even amplified by this black orb, it can’t instantly kill, but… given two hours, I can end every last one of your lives.”</p>
<p>“Distasteful,” I say.</p>
<p>“Say what you want. This is goodbye, anyway,” Erne smiles.</p>
<p>She snaps her fingers. Instantly, parts of the fence and walls vanish, creating a straight path outside.</p>
<p>“Plans account for all possibilities. Of course I’d set up an escape route in case my identity was uncovered!</p>
<p>“She’s getting away!”</p>
<p>“Patience.”</p>
<p>As Erne runs for the gap in the wall, I hold Princess Krell back as she tries to follow and toss a mana-infused coin forward. It clangs as it hits the floor, and magical circles spread from the point of impact, shooting out dozens of sharp spears.</p>
<p>“Eep!”</p>
<p>“An obstruction… or rather, an attempt on her life, it would seem.”</p>
<p>Princess Krell was distracted by the disappearing walls, but I keenly sensed the subtle mana movements at the same time. And if I were in Erne’s shoes, I’d have made arrangements to deal with pursuers. Just disordering my vital processes doesn’t disorder my thoughts or actions.</p>
<p>“Seeing even invisible traps… Oh, I just can’t keep up.”</p>
<p>Erne complains as she reaches the hollow where the wall vanished.</p>
<p>“Don’t interfere with my revenge any more!”</p>
<p>She falls backwards through the hole.</p>
<p>I shatter the spears blocking my way and rush to the hole with Princess Krell. But even peering down, there’s no sign of Erne.</p>
<p>She’s quick on her feet.</p>
<p>As I mentally murmur this, Princess Krell suddenly mutters:</p>
<p>“She mentioned revenge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I definitely heard that.”</p>
<p>I don’t know for sure what she wants revenge for.</p>
<p>But before she fell, Erne’s expression was… contorted in grief. Tears streamed from the corners of her eyes as she gritted her teeth, choking back sobs.</p>
<p>We can’t know her reasons now—any speculation would just be groundless guesses. But one thing is clear: a decision to threaten human life must have some great cause behind it. From her last expression, I understand this is no thrill killing.</p>
<p>Just what drove her this far?</p>
<p>The answer lies in capturing Erne and restraining her, but… that will have to wait a bit, unfortunately.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell… It seems this situation will determine the future of the capital and the empire.”</p>
<p>I point forward as I speak to my lady.</p>
<p>Hanging in the starry capital sky is a massive sphere, emitting an ominous glow.</p>
<p>Its near-black color contains an abnormal amount of mana, and it shows no signs of moving from its position above the capital. It simply remains still, continuously releasing its suspicious light.</p>
<p>After staring at the sphere in silence for over ten seconds, Princess Krell asks me:</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of power it has?”</p>
<p>“I do not. However, leaving it be would certainly be unwise… What shall we do?”</p>
<p>“It’s decided”</p>
<p>Princess Krell answers without hesitation.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand. I know what action you will take. You who, despite the abuse, continues to love the empire—your decision is obvious.</p>
<p>“Prepare yourself. We’ll need your power to destroy that.”</p>
<p>At her rare command, I rejoice internally as I put a hand to my chest and bow.</p>
<p>“As You will.. My… ‘King.'”</p>
<p>translator note : Roth explicitly using “king” 『王』 in that sentence</p>
