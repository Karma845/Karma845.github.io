<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter IV: Turning Point</h1>

<p class="calibre5">“Welcome!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“One grilled order coming right up!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such energetic calls were echoing inside the restaurant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We were at a sushi place along Route 10.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kandagawa.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A local favorite, this neighborhood sushi restaurant offers everything from sushi to local cuisine&mdash;a variety of menus being their selling point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The locally caught fish is firm, and the grilled (teppanyaki) local chicken is superb.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a bit pricey, so we only use it for occasions like birthdays or our parents’ wedding anniversaries.</p>
<p class="calibre5">During Obon or the New Year’s holidays, you have to reserve or you’ll end up waiting in line until closing time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Today is a weekday, so we were seated right away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or rather, Himari knows an alumna who works here and since it’s not the busy season, she sweet-talks her way to get in easily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Around the table in the private room, Himari raised her teacup.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, let’s start the celebration for the completion of Yuu’s new accessory!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“yay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I replied absentmindedly and clinked our teacups together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sipping the hot tea, I instantly felt, ‘Alright, let’s eat some sushi.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was putting some Gari onto a small plate, I noticed the two opposite me looked dazed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, Makishima, aren’t you two eating?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not what you should be asking!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima retorted sharply.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looked around timidly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsu! I heard we were eating out, but why at a serious sushi restaurant!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hi-chan. This place is kind of expensive, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I fiddled with the touchscreen on the ordering tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s true that the place is mostly filled with families and working couples.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There probably aren’t any other groups wearing high school uniforms.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari snorted through her nose with a ‘heh.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Makishima-kun. If you didn’t want to come, you didn’t have to. I invited you because Yuu insisted.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmph! Using Natsu as leverage is low! That’s what I don’t like about you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Both of you, please get along at least during the meal…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, whatever. I proceed to place my order without concern.</p>
<p class="calibre5">First up for me is the grilled mackerel sushi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The freshly grilled, warm mackerel sushi is the best.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It crumbles softly in the mouth, with the fat melting away&mdash;a taste you could never get from the prepared food section of a supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And Himari always orders the tomato and mozzarella salad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s served on a platter for several people, but she astonishingly finishes it on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I pass the tablet to Makishima and the others, they take it with a tired look.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You guys definitely have a weird sense of money…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve only been here for birthdays…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite saying that, they still order without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima starts with a sushi platter and teppanyaki chicken. That’s basic stuff for the locals.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san orders seasonal tempura, bamboo shoot tempura with plum paste&mdash;it’s a perennial favorite around this time of year. It’s really delicious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As the food that had been ordered began to arrive, Makishima asked while picking up his chopsticks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Normally, don’t we have the celebration after the photo shoot is finished?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since I had just popped a piece of mackerel sushi in my mouth, Himari answered for me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s because once you post on Instagram, you’re too busy dealing with orders to have any free time. Yuu has to concentrate on making the pieces, and I help with packing and stuff. It usually takes about a month to settle down.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By then, it feels too late to even call it a ‘celebration’. I’d rather prioritize going home and sleeping.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. It must be tough being in demand, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, don’t praise me too much. When it’s just individual effort, it inevitably takes that long.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If we had better equipment, the efficiency would probably improve.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that’s difficult while still in high school. Above all, there’s little free time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to graduate quickly, rent a space like a workshop, and focus on creating…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima grins with a snicker.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, will you show us this new piece you’re talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sure. Might be a bit early, but I’ll reveal it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took out a rectangular paper box from my bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, the theme is ‘Love.’ It’s a delicate one, and I decided to focus on the atmosphere of the accessory case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s made with red Japanese paper sourced from a craft store that once helped with an Instagram shoot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When the lid is opened, a preserved tulip flower with a vivid crimson color appears. Putting on gloves, I carefully pick it up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This time, it’s a hairpin. I had the idea of blending the accessory into Enomoto-san’s reddish-black hair. I’ve mentioned it to Enomoto-san before, but tulips are flowers that change the extent of their bloom with the day’s temperature. For this, I processed it at above 20℃… when the petals are fully opened.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Natsu, this is amazing. I had no idea tulips could open their petals this wide.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Passing the gloves, I let Makishima hold it too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What about this part of the hairpin? It’s not made of metal, is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is lacquered wood. I ordered it from the same store where I got the accessory case. It’s not mass-produced, so it’s a bit more expensive, and that drove the price up…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No-no, it’s very good. Rin-chan, you think so too, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yes, it’s really beautiful…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was about to hand it to Enomoto-san, Himari suddenly cut in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, you surprised me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost dropped the hairpin by accident.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I quickly reached out and caught it just in time…that was close to it getting a soy sauce flavor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari! That was dangerous!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah!? S-Sorry-sorry…I just got a little too excited.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She laughed with an apologetic look, ‘Ahaha.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve made a few at once, so I do have a spare, but this one turned out to be the most beautifully colored.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I’d prefer to use this one for the photoshoot.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“After the shoot, I plan to give this one to Enomoto-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, you surprised me!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time it was Enomoto-san who suddenly leaned forward over the table. I almost crushed the hairpin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s going on? Is today ‘Startle People Day’? Was there a TV show on that yesterday?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s up with you, Enomoto-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no, it’s just that, Yu-kun…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her gaze was fixed on the hairpin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Until now, Himari has kept all the accessories used for shoots. So, I intended to give this one to Enomoto-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? Can I have it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m getting help from you, after all. Oh, if you’d prefer something else…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, this is perfect! Ah, I mean, I’d like this one!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay. If you like it, that’s great.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. It’s really cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And while Himari was taking a picture of the hairpin with her smartphone camera, she nodded in agreement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really, it feels like Yuu’s masterpiece. I think it’s super cute too. It’s definitely going to set a sales record!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, well, thanks…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve already decided on the sales catchphrase. ‘The red flower of fate that binds loved ones together.’ It’s a play on the red string of fate, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: She’s substituting the ‘red string’ of fate (赤い糸) with the ‘red flower’ of fate (赤い花).)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I can understand it even without the explanation. But aren’t you getting ahead of yourself?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not at all. Whether or not she’s conscious of this can change the model’s expression.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, she turned to Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Right, Enocchi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Uh, yeah, maybe…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, it’s decided we’re going with this catchphrase. ‘The red flower of fate that binds loved ones together.’ It’s perfect for you guys.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…That last remark was clearly unnecessary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Lately, Himari keeps saying things like this, as if trying to make Enomoto-san and me overly conscious of each other.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This must be bothersome for Enomoto-san too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, Himari. You’re misunderstanding something&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Makishima raised his voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right, Natsu! Since we’re at it, why don’t you put it on Rin-chan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What are you blabbering about all of a sudden…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can’t he stop competing with Himari at the weirdest times?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san and I make eye contact, then she blushes slightly and leans her face towards me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then…please…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seriously?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san is… well, easily swayed by the mood.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really hope she doesn’t get caught by some weird guy in the future.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, come on.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Natsu, show us what you’ve got!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shut up, don’t start getting along only when you’re ganging on me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While the two pointed their smartphone cameras at us, I held the hairpin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looked at me with a fervent gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">… What’s this feeling?</p>
<p class="calibre5">My heart is pounding… and why have Himari and the others suddenly gone silent and are just staring?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I need them to tease me more, or it’s going to be embarrassingly serious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I push aside Enomoto-san’s bangs, tucking them behind her ear. She squirms as if tickled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, I slide the hairpin into the parted section and tighten it tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, the vibrant red of the tulip stands out beautifully against her glossy black hair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How about this…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Thank you…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She shyly smiles again with a ‘Hehe’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…This girl really looks so happy. It makes me feel kind of strange.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I glance at Himari and the others, for some reason, they’re also turning away with embarrassed expressions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No way. Yuu, this is a bit too er*tic…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. Though it was I who suggested it, maybe it wasn’t something we should do in a public place…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What does that mean!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Are they saying my accessory is against public order and morals!?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, well! Now that the main event is over, let’s move on to the next order!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey Himari. Order the most expensive sushi. Tuna and crab, as much as they have.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh!? Yuu, I have to show the receipt to Onii-chan, you know!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up. Don’t think it ends here after making me so embarrassed.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Regarding Himari, I’ll make sure to have Hibari-san scold her later.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">Looking at the clock, it’s almost 20:00.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We’ve eaten well, so it’s about time to start thinking of leaving.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, how are you getting home?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, Shi-kun is having his Onii-san come to pick us up, so I’ll ride with them.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s the advantage of childhood friends. I can rest easy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima, on the other hand, had gone to the drink bar for one last round. From that direction, he comes back shaking a glass of melon soda.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His expression is odd, furrowing his brow intensely and staring hard at Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… it’s about time…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought I heard him mumble something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As we sat down, Makishima suddenly said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, what do you plan to do next, Natsu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Next step?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After taking a big gulp of melon soda, he slammed the glass down on the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let me be frank. Make Rin-chan your exclusive model.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The place went silent at his words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari… no, even Enomoto-san looked at Makishima as if she’s hearing this for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Amidst this, Makishima continued with a gesture that was almost like giving a speech.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsu seemed to take quite a liking to Rin-chan during this shoot. The accessory is completed to a perfect one that I am in awe of. From what I see, you two are a perfect match. It’s not a bad deal, is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, Enomoto-san is beautiful, and I appreciate it, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right! You understand perfectly! Rin-chan is beautiful. Such talent is not easily found. If she continues as your exclusive model, she will transform even more. Join hands with Rin-chan and aim for greater heights!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The conversation is moving too quickly. Besides, you’re ignoring Enomoto-san’s will.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This seems like Makishima’s impulsive idea.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not like Enomoto-san stands to gain anything from my accessories, I can’t impose that much trouble on her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Yuu-kun is okay with it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Seriously?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san, surprisingly, agrees.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She got swayed again… no, it doesn’t feel like that. Her expression seemed to reveal her true feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s as if she found an opportunity through Makishima’s offer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…In that case, there’s no reason for me to refuse.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, if being the model for my accessories is fun for you…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just as I was about to accept…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;you can’t do that!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…It was Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her voice was incredibly loud. No, rather than just loud… it somehow sounded like a scream.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not only were Enomoto-san and I surprised, but the families seated at the surrounding tables were also looking at us in astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Only Makishima’s mouth was twisted up in a look of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Regaining her composure, Himari hurriedly said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…sorry, my voice was a bit too loud.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She laughed brightly and responded to Makishima’s suggestion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Of course, I think Makishima-kun’s suggestion is good. I would also welcome Enocchi with open arms. But, I wonder if it’s really for Enocchi’s benefit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Why do you think that?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima asked, slightly sullen.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You know, Yuu, that promotional account we started, the follower count and such has skyrocketed this past year, hasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It had skyrocketed even though we’ve only been active on Instagram for about a year.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But you know, there are also negative comments like, ‘Don’t get cocky just because you’re cute,’ or ‘This girl always try to be the center of attention in picture of sweets (lol)’ I don’t mind, but Enocchi isn’t used to dealing with anonymous hate, and it can be hard. There’s no need for her to face that, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima quickly retorted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Since she has already modeled for Instagram this time, wouldn’t that reasoning no longer apply?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Being a one-time guest and becoming an ongoing exclusive is different. The more you’re in the spotlight, the more likely she is to attract haters…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Such mental care should be the responsibility of her Senpai, Himari-chan, right? You’re not trying to avoid the increased workload, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“In the first place, we were talking about whether or not Enocchi is suited for it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you really think so? You should already know that Rin-chan isn’t that weak. In fact, she’s threatening enough to make you feel afraid right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What do you think I’m trying to say?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, the atmosphere had become strangely tense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The debate was heating up… or rather, the two were increasingly becoming confrontational.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They always argued with me in the middle, but this was somehow different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What exactly was wrong with the two of them?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Both of you, let’s calm down a bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, this doesn’t concern you, so keep out of it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. Natsu isn’t needed right now!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought this was supposed to be about my accessory modeling job?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then Himari brought up more points of contention.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“First of all, what about helping out at home? There’s also the brass band too. These past few weeks, she has been helping out here non-stop. Handling three tasks at once is just impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahahaha! With this project, I’ve already got a grasp on your production rotation. Just earlier, you mentioned that after a single Instagram post, you’d focus solely on sales for the next month. From there, you decide on a new theme then cultivate flowers… At least, if it’s just modeling, it would only take about two weeks every three months. It’s not like it’s going to take up all her time continuously.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But if we’re going to do this, we’d need you to participate in events like the cultural festival, too. And then there’s submitting the flower reports, which is… a lot of work.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What are you talking about? This is about Natsu being an exclusive model, not about getting Rin-chan to join the gardening club. You’re getting off-topic.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima looked at Himari with amusement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari-chan, why are you in such a hurry?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I’m not in a hurry? I’m just considering what’s best for Enocchi…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her expression was unusually fragile for her. Opposite of her typically aloof demeanor… she looked like a weak little girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Like a child who is about to have a treasured toy or doll confiscated by their parents, looking on the verge of tears.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As if desperately clutching onto it, begging someone to help.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu, you think so too, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s points were valid. Indeed, such slander exists, and as the account gains popularity, those types of people start showing up more and more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But in the end, it’s just envy. Because Himari is cute, they’re just jealous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s something that can be resolved with proper mental care, just as Makishima says.</p>

<p class="calibre5">More importantly, what about Enomoto-san’s feelings?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Originally, we got her involved because it suited our needs. It would be utterly insincere to just say goodbye when she’s no longer needed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari has also been taking care of practical tasks like order processing, and reducing the modeling burden is a benefit.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We profit from her involvement, so there’s no reason to refuse.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, if she wants to do it, why not let her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s face contorted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, are you serious?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“More than serious. I mean, I don’t even understand why you’re rejecting it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But, we’ve been working so hard together, just the two of us!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, but it’s not like we made a promise that it has to be just the two of us. Originally, we brought in Enomoto-san to incorporate a third-party inspiration, right? It’s been successful. That’s why it would be strange to refuse her offer if she’s willing to continue.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s true, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She awkwardly put her mouth to the Calpis straw.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Besides, Himari, haven’t you been acting a bit too strange lately?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Strange? How?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’ve been overly emphasizing ‘love’ lately, but it’s clearly too much. Sure, it’s an important element when doing business with women, but there’s no need for you to forcefully express it, Himari…You always say you don’t understand romantic feelings.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Originally, Himari had a more refreshing neutral image.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She should continue to demonstrate her true value as a model in the context of the seasons and nature, as she has until now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no need to stubbornly stick to a genre of modeling she’s not comfortable with.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a division of roles will be one of the advantages of having Enomoto-san join us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That is….well, just a pretext.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was more concerned about something else. A part that I really want to talk about.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Besides, if you keep coming up with pranks or whatever each time we make themed accessories…it’s a bit troublesome.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s face turned bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I implicitly mentioned that incident in the science room the other day. It seems she got the message.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I don’t want to be pressured in such a heart-pounding way by Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because if that kind of thing repeats… I might end up falling for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, our agreement was no romance, so it’s only natural to avoid such risks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Until now, even if there was clinginess or er*tic talk… there wasn’t a sense of a romantic atmosphere between a man and a woman for the two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, if we’re going to make ‘love’ accessories in the future and Himari says ‘Should we experience it?’ and approaches me for a kiss again… honestly, I’m not confident I can stop myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I end up wanting someone like Enomoto-san, who can stop Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Actually, just thinking about all of this is already troublesome.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So I’m sorry, but I can’t take Himari’s side this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did I anger her? No, but it’s actually Himari’s fault. She’s the one who invited Enomoto-san, so her attitude this time is totally selfish.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…While thinking this, I noticed Himari’s hands moving frantically.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was rummaging through her bag, muttering something to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Calm down, calm down, calm down. It’s okay, Himari, you can do it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himari? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Fu, Nfufu. Nothing? I’m just looking for my Yoguruppe…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But you just drank the last one today, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari froze with a snap.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Warmth seemed to drain from her expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Sorry. Looks like I can’t calm down.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I turned around, Himari was smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And with a full-faced smile… she turned over a glass of Calpis over my head. Naturally, it soaked me completely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san is staring with a blank expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even Makishima had his mouth agape in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While chewing on the straw, Himari said with a smile,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Should we do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What did she just say?</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I stood dumbfounded, Himari said it again, clearly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A complete breakup.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ha?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Complete breakup?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The “I won’t talk to you anymore” thing? Is that what it means?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Boys in elementary school would sometimes make a fuss about it. By the way, I have no experience with that… because I had no friends.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari… You’re joking, right…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…joking?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the next moment, Himari’s smile twisted like a demon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The straw she was biting into snapped off&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, I’m really, really, reaally done with youuuu!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whaaatttt!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Mine and Himari’s screams exploded in the Kandagawa store.</p>
