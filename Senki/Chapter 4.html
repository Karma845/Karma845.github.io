<h1>Chapter 4: The Solitary Genius – Kanade Kurotsuki</h1>


<p> <br />The subsequent developments were, well, there’s not much to say about the flow.<br /> <br />The overwhelmingly superior Netsuhara and the cornered Class C.<br /> <br />If we don’t accept the Duel Request conflict―no, if we don’t take the request to Class A, Netsuhara’s assaults will continue. And for how many countermeasures against the assaults can we really keep up indefinitely?<br /> <br />The quickest way to stop the assaults is to just accept the Duel Request conflict.<br /> <br />But our opponent is that Netsuhara, malicious from any angle you look.<br /> <br />It also makes the choice to accept the Duel Request difficult.<br /> <br />With both options leading to dead ends, Asahina couldn’t immediately come to a conclusion in that situation.<br /> <br />The class’s opinions were completely split―and as a result, we couldn’t even have a discussion.<br /> <br />According to Netsuhara: ‘Well, the time limit’s the end of school today.’<br /> <br />All that remained were the stifling air and feelings of anger.<br /> <br />Amidst that, Asahina Kasumi apologized.<br /> <br />“…I’m sorry. My judgement was lacking.”<br /> <br />“Th-That’s not true at all!”<br /> <br />Kurashiki reflexively reacted to her words.<br /> <br />“That guy… How could we know something like that would happen!? Attacking Manabe-kun for no reason, just because we don’t like him! Netsuhara-kun is the weird one, not you Kasumi-chan!”<br /> <br />Angry class rep Kurashiki. Our classmates nod at her words.<br /> <br />Asahina-san looks uneasy… Not sure why, but she glances at me so I casually avert my gaze. I’m not involved so don’t look at me.<br /> <br />“But…doesn’t that leave us with no choice but to accept the bastard?”<br /> <br />“Or we capture him in the act of attacking and present that as ‘evidence.'”<br /> <br />Sakaki-sensei interjects at Sakuma’s words.<br /> <br />For her, it’s unusually cooperative. She must see this incident as a big deal.<br /> <br />She folds her arms in a grumpy manner, tapping her index finger on them.<br /> <br />“The only reason Netsuhara currently has the ‘advantage’ is because ‘there’s no evidence of his violence.’ What that boy is doing goes against school rules in the first place. If we had evidence, I would readily expel him myself.”<br /> <br />“But isn’t that dangerous!?”<br /> <br />One of Kurashiki’s gal friends raises her voice at Sakaki-sensei’s reliable words.<br /> <br />“Getting evidence means someone else has to be attacked, right? That guy seems like he’d readily attack girls too so it’s scary… Right, Asahina-san?”<br /> <br />“That’s true. …Sakaki-sensei, I appreciate the offer but I absolutely don’t want to use anyone as bait. We’ll only use that method when we have no other choice.”<br /> <br />At Asahina-san’s words, Kurashiki briefly glances this way.<br /> <br />‘With you, wouldn’t being bait be possible without getting hurt?’<br /> <br />I can see those feelings coming through so I decided to completely ignore her.<br /> <br />No way. He’s clearly above Kirido, there’s no way I can win!<br /> <br />I couldn’t even beat Kirido so there’s obviously no way I can win in a normal fight.<br /> <br />As I turn my gaze out the window, I feel Kurashiki’s resignation.<br /> <br />‘You don’t plan on making a move huh.’<br /> <br />I can almost hear that in the aura she gives off, and internally I nod.<br /> <br />That’s right, I won’t take the frontlines this time either. I don’t plan on getting involved at all.<br /> <br />Unless some merit of being at the front comes up or I’m directly harmed, no chance.<br /> <br />“…I will defeat Netsuhara-kun.”<br /> <br />A girl raises her voice.<br /> <br />Looking ahead, Asahina Kasumi’s eyes show her resolve.<br /> <br />“In pure combat, there are no abilities superior to mine… Right, Sakaki-sensei?”<br /> <br />“Well…with a few exceptions.”<br /> <br />For just a brief instant, I noticed her gaze turn this way ever so slightly.<br /> <br />Huh, what’s with looking at me suddenly in this situation? Why glance my way now?<br /> <br />Well, to someone not in the know, it was such a brief moment they probably wouldn’t notice.<br /> <br />“At least against ordinary students, you would undoubtedly have the advantage. Your special power is exceptionally outstanding among all the blessings.”<br /> <br />“…Then my answer remains as stated earlier.”<br /> <br />And so Asahina repeats her determination.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“―I will defeat Netsuhara-kun. That is what I believe to be the best course of action.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It was the simplest in my expectations yet also the most difficult to achieve.<br /> <br />In other words, it was the minimum resolution.<br /> </p>



<p>☆☆☆<br /> </p>






<p> <br />A contest of pure power. A feat of might through special abilities.<br /> <br />“Things have taken an unpleasant turn.”<br /> <br />After school, Asahina and Netsuhara were going to talk.<br /> <br />The contents… Well, we’d find out tomorrow morning.<br /> <br />The class’s core members like Kurashiki, Sakuma, and Karasuma apparently accompanied Asahina-san, but I didn’t go. I have hardly any interest after all.<br /> <br />I sit in a chair in my classroom, gazing out the window.<br /> <br />“So…here you are, Amamori.”<br /> <br />Suddenly, a voice comes from the entrance.<br /> <br />Looking back… Rare to see Sakaki-sensei standing there.<br /> <br />“What is it…Sakaki-sensei?”<br /> <br />“Oh, about the Netsuhara issue… I wanted to ask about your plans.”<br /> <br />My plans…?<br /> <br />No no, I’ve decided to do nothing.<br /> <br />There are no other options worth considering, obviously.<br /> <br />As I was about to say that, she pierces me with sharp eyes.<br /> <br />“Don’t pretend to be useless in front of me… Know that.”<br /> <br />Pretending to be useless…<br /> <br />A cold air starts drifting amidst her words.<br /> <br />“I know about your [ability]. I know about your [situation]. I even know about your [family]. I’ve looked into everything about you… After all, you’re a big name since this academy started. Isn’t that right, Amamori Yuuto?”<br /> <br />“Yep…I really don’t like you.”<br /> <br />My frank rejection just makes her smile deepen.<br /> <br />“Well say what you will. I have expectations for you. And at the same time, my heart is also racing. After all…no one else has noticed you yet, someone of your caliber. With just one move from you, the current school ethos could easily be overturned.”<br /> <br />Letting her words go in one ear and out the other, I think.<br /> <br />When entering this academy, we took every precaution regarding information control and concealment.<br /> <br />The principal probably doesn’t even know about me.<br /> <br />For her to…somehow obtain that kind of information and look into my name, she must have realized my registered Eye ability was ‘false’ after investigating the academy’s records. Then looking into various other things… Well, I figured that’s how it happened but I didn’t expect her to find out even my background…<br /> <br />“So…it was about Netsuhara, yes?”<br /> <br />“Blatantly changing the subject… Oh well, fine. As you can probably imagine, the man Netsuhara is too much for the current Class 1-C.”<br /> <br />Her words are certainly true.<br /> <br />Netsuhara is too strong for the present Class C… He’s far too cunning.<br /> <br />The current Class C is a one man team centered around Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />If she nods, everyone heads that way. If she shakes her head, even the right thing becomes a mistake. …Maybe an overstatement, but roughly that’s the situation.<br /> <br />And for Asahina-san who is at the center, the current Netsuhara is too much of a formidable foe.<br /> <br />If she’s led astray and cornered, the class will naturally be driven into a corner as well.<br /> <br />In conclusion, Class C defeating Netsuhara would be difficult.<br /> <br />The ‘too much’ Sakaki mentioned must be what she meant.<br /> <br />“It’ll be fine right? It’s not only Asahina-san we can rely on. There’s Kurashiki-san, Sakuma, and Karasuma too. If everyone’s together, surely…”<br /> <br />“…Are you seriously thinking it will be alright?”<br /> <br />Sakaki looks at me in disbelief.<br />But my answer doesn’t change.<br />I say something very refreshing and youthful.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“It’ll be fine. Because I believe in everyone.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I give her a smile after spouting some shallow lip service.<br /> <br />She widens her eyes at my words, but soon disappointment settles in them.<br /> <br />Yet at the same time, her eyes also contain ‘expectation’ to the same degree.<br /> <br />“Oh well… Either way, if you don’t make a move, this class is done for, Amamori Yuuto.”<br /> <br />Saying that, she leaves the classroom.<br /> <br />Looking at the clock… It’s a good time now. I sit back in the chair and exhale.<br /> <br />There’s no lie in what I told Sakaki.<br /> <br />I do believe it.<br /> <br />–That with their current level, they can’t do anything about Netsuhara.<br /> <br />Without a doubt, they’ll come back forced to swallow disadvantageous conditions. Kurashiki went with them too but… At this stage, I don’t think they can do anything.<br /> <br />Asahina Kasumi is… A hero of justice is strongest when brandishing justice.<br /> <br />No matter the opponent, once deemed an enemy she won’t bend.<br /> <br />She won’t bend so…she can’t bend.<br /> <br />They’ll all die stumbling on a small pebble.<br /> <br />That’s the kind of life heroes of justice lead, something I’ve known for a long time.<br /> <br />“Geez…that’s why I hate them. Heroes of justice.”<br /> <br />As I’ve stated before, with things as they are, Asahina Kasumi will undoubtedly fail.<br /> <br />…Well, I’m just observing from the sidelines so I can’t really say anything.<br /> </p>



<p>☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Let’s skip the annoying crap and go straight to crushing each other!”<br /> <br />In Class 1-A, Netsuhara’s opening remark.<br /> <br />The A Class students, despite it being after school, are all still in the classroom sitting at their desks hanging their heads.<br /> <br />A truly bizarre sight, the four representatives of Class C thought.<br /> <br />“Asahina…was it? The extras tagging along are the shitty flower garden brain class rep, the musclebrain successor, and that goldfish shithead, right?”<br /> <br />At his words, the expressions of Kurashiki, Sakuma, and Karasuma waver slightly.<br /> <br />However, they had imagined being talked to like this beforehand.<br /> <br />That’s why they don’t talk back and get straight to the main issue.<br /> <br />“…So what’s this ‘crushing each other’ mean?”<br /> <br />“Oh geez, monkeys really are dumb and troublesome. So listen here–“<br /> <br />“–Netsuhara Eien. Please stop the unsightly provocations. We are trying to have a serious discussion.”<br /> <br />Asahina stops Netsuhara as he starts to provoke like usual.<br /> <br />Even Netsuhara whistles impressed at her words.</p>

<p>“Oooh, nice. If that’s your attitude, I’ll get serious too. The Duel Request conflict contents are simple and clear. We’ll ‘bet 600,000 yen on crushing each other.'”<br /> <br />600,000 yen. In other words, over 20,000 yen collected per person.<br /> <br />Right after enrolling, nearly all the students were fined 10,000 yen. That leaves 40,000 remaining. Even taking living expenses into account with 35,000 left, losing would reduce it to 15,000. The students’ lives would likely become quite difficult.<br /> <br />In this severe rule-abiding hell where breaking the rules just twice leads to expulsion, it’s tremendous pressure on the students.<br /> <br />“You are…”<br /> <br />“I said everyone gets expelled if you lose, but now that I think about it, that was too soft.”<br /> <br />Madness is distorting his eyes.<br /> <br />Asahina grits her teeth strongly but he seems to enjoy even that expression.<br /> <br />“I don’t just wanna crush you! Not knowing when you’ll be crushed, when you’ll be expelled. So anxious you can’t sleep at night, your mind wears down and you go crazy, getting completely crushed mentally and physically too! That’s what I wanna see!”<br /> <br />The A Class students tremble at those words.<br /> <br />What dwelled there was a terror greater than death aimed at a single student.<br /> <br />“But it won’t be by ‘using others.’ I’ll destroy them with my own hands. That’s what’s fun, interesting! Kicking others down, trampling and crushing them, standing above them is how you ‘live!’ That’s why life can’t be stopped!”<br /> <br />“You… scum.”<br /> <br />Asahina’s eyes fill with hostility.<br /> <br />This man is of the same kind as Kirido… No, he’s an even greater evil.<br /> <br />I have to defeat him, to protect someone. …To not let any more victims appear.<br /> <br />“Yeah… Let’s do a six person elimination tournament. Winner takes 600,000 yen! It’s unbearably fun! A game betting people’s lives!”<br /> <br />“That’s out of the question. Even if you lose, the compensation would be the ‘money extorted from classmates’… We don’t need such things.”<br /> <br />At Asahina’s words, Sakuma nods and Karasuma smiles wryly.<br /> <br />600,000 yen is certainly a large sum. It could work to our advantage later on.<br /> <br />But the premise is that Asahina Kasumi is a hero of justice.<br /> <br />She who allows no injustice would never agree to those rules.<br /> <br />“What we request from you is a ‘permanent prohibition on violence toward others, directly or indirectly. As well as a prohibition on inflicting harm on others.’ And ‘return of the money taken from classmates.'”<br /> <br />“Hey now…the only condition we’d offer other than 600,000 is nothing, got it?”<br /> <br />“Then let’s do this. If you win, 600,000 yen. If I win, your injustice will be corrected.”<br /> <br />Hearing those words, Netsuhara laughed.<br /> <br />As if things had gone exactly according to plan.<br /> <br />Seeing his expression, Kurashiki reflexively raises her voice to stop her. But–<br /> <br />“K-Kasumi-chan! That’s–“<br /> <br />“I’m sorry, Hotaru-san. But please don’t worry. I will definitely win.”<br /> <br />That was her confidence, resolve, and determination as the embodiment of justice.<br /> <br />However, Kurashiki felt great unease.<br /> <br />In this world, there exist opponents that cannot be defeated with determination alone.<br /> <br />Evil that cannot be defeated by justice.<br /> <br />For instance… Yes, irregulars like Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />She doesn’t think Netsuhara is the same kind as him. But Kurashiki’s intuition told her.<br /> <br />That this man is surely also a monster.<br /> <br />“Oho, then it’s decided! Let’s do it, a life betting crushing match!”<br /> <br />And so the worst Duel Request conflict is set.<br /> <br />Swirling inside is enmity so dense it makes you spit blood.<br /> <br />Will a demon or snake come out?<br /> <br />At the very least, there was certainly ‘something’ that wouldn’t go smoothly.<br /> <br />Kurashiki Hotaru realized that much in the current situation.<br /> </p>







<p>☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p>The next day, information was brought by Asahina.<br /> <br />The time was 15 minutes before homeroom.<br /> <br />It’s also rare for Sakaki-sensei who is always punctual to be in the classroom during this pre-homeroom time, showing how seriously she is taking this incident too.<br /> <br />The issue was discussed amidst that.<br /> <br />Regarding the Duel Request conflict, the rules are simple.<br /> <br />An anything-goes 6-on-6 crushing match.<br /> <br />The match is decided only when the opponent loses consciousness or surrenders.<br /> <br />The match format is a tournament-style elimination. In other words, just one person could theoretically defeat all six opponents if they wanted. Whether that’s realistically possible or not is another issue.<br /> <br />And regarding that ‘victory reward’…<br /> <br />The moment Asahina-san spoke, silence descended on the class.<br /> <br />Looking at Kurashiki, she seemed vexed as she bit her lip.<br /> <br />Personally, it wasn’t the worst case in my expectations, so isn’t it fine? That was my honest feeling. Though of course it’s still bad despite not being the worst.<br /> <br />No matter how competent Kurashiki is… Even if I had been there.<br /> <br />I’m certain Asahina-san would not have bent. She would not have changed her decision. I’m convinced of that.<br /> <br />In other words, the conclusion is, the moment you’re in the same class as Asahina, just give up.<br /> <br />“That’s a lie… 600,000 yen!?”<br /> <br />“Th-That much money…”<br /> <br />“Even if we could pay it, doing that would…”<br /> <br />No matter how much charisma Asahina-san has, she’s still someone else in the end.<br /> <br />Faced with the outrageously high amount, unease spills out from the classmates.<br /> <br />However, Asahina-san did not waver before those voices.<br /> <br />Gradually amidst the silence enveloping the class, Asahina-san spoke up.<br /> <br />“First of all… I’m very sorry. I selfishly put everyone in danger… This isn’t something that can be forgiven with an apology, but please allow me to apologize.”<br /> <br />Saying that, she deeply bows her head.<br /> <br />The chattering classmates also look dumbfounded at her attitude.<br /> <br />As she doesn’t raise her head at all, the classmates start responding to Asahina-san one by one. “It’s alright” “Don’t mind it” “We can leave it to Asahina-san” and such.<br /> <br />I can’t believe in leaving my fate to someone else, but she can get that kind of mood flowing easily. She really is a ‘natural monument.’ And that’s why I decided to make full use of her too.<br /> <br />“At the same time, I want everyone to feel at ease. You will not have to take on any danger whatsoever. This was proposed by me… I will take responsibility and defeat him myself.”<br /> <br />Asahina-san’s eyes show strong determination.<br /> <br />The powerful will is obvious to anyone at a glance.<br /> <br />Unable to refute that compelling power, the classmates swallow their breath.<br /> <br />Who was first to say it, the word “As expected.”<br /> <br />Starting with that, words of expectation for Asahina-san begin pouring out.<br /> <br />Certainly, Asahina Kasumi is strong.<br /> <br />Looking at the whole school, there are few ability users superior to her.<br /> <br />Strength of ‘special powers’ that can make you convinced of that.<br /> <br />If they fight, there’s no way Asahina Kasumi will lose to Netsuhara. We knew that from the start.<br /> <br />However, there’s no guarantee the opponent will face her head-on.<br /> <br />Netsuhara has a nasty personality. He’s cunning, underhanded, and greedy for victory.<br /> <br />“Given Netsuhara Eien’s personality, he will definitely come out first. To display an overwhelming difference in power. To defeat all of us alone. So I will fight as the vanguard and defeat him… The Class A students are just threatened by him. The match should be decided by that alone.”<br /> <br />No no, you’re wrong Asahina-san.<br /> <br />If I were Netsuhara, I would anticipate and utilize even that thinking.<br /> <br />What would displease a hero of justice like Asahina Kasumi?<br /> <br />I’d comprehend her thoughts, scheme, and surely…he would devise the worst strategy.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />I look at the girl facing straight ahead and consider saying something.<br /> <br />If I search for advice to give her, the words to say come immediately.<br /> <br />‘You shouldn’t be the first one out from the start.’<br /> <br />Conveying just that much is enough. With that one line, Netsuhara’s plan would be destroyed.<br /> <br />Class C could surely achieve an easy victory without worries, Netsuhara wouldn’t be able to fight on his home turf at all, and would be defeated in a direct confrontation with Asahina-san. I can be certain of that much.<br /> <br />–But how does telling her that beforehand connect to what comes after?<br /> <br />Avoiding danger is important… But danger and opportunities for growth are two sides of the same coin.<br /> <br />If we evade everything, this class will never grow.<br /> <br />I briefly feel Sakaki-sensei’s gaze and lightly shrug it off.<br /> <br />…Yep, my opinion hasn’t changed.<br /> <br />No matter the danger, no matter if the class goes the wrong way.<br /> <br />I won’t make a move until just before course correction becomes impossible.<br /> <br />The words I heard before cross my mind: ‘If you don’t move, this class will be destroyed.’ But it passes through without affecting me.<br /> <br />The die has already been cast, Sakaki-sensei.<br /> <br />There’s no going back. What has begun cannot be reversed.<br /> <br />…This match will also be good learning for Asahina-san.<br /> <br />Because this ‘Duel Request Conflict’…<br /> <br />–is sure to begin with a crushing defeat she couldn’t foresee.<br /> <br />“I will never yield to evil.”</p>

<p> <br />The time for the after school match with Class A soon arrived.<br /> <br />Waiting for Class C gathered on the grounds was Class 1-A led by Netsuhara.<br /> <br />Looking at the school building, many students are watching the situation below.<br /> <br />The first Duel Request Conflict since the school year began. And a class vs class large-scale battle at that.<br /> <br />It would be stranger if it didn’t stand out.<br /> <br />“Oooh, so you came without running away huh. How admirable.”<br /> <br />Netsuhara laughs as his red hair sways in the wind.<br /> <br />The silver mesh mixed in with his red hair reflects the sunlight dully and shines.<br /> <br />His eyes quiver with delight and…looking at his feet, I grimaced without thinking.<br /> <br />“…Just how despicable can you be, Netsuhara Eien?”<br /> <br />At the end of Asahina-san’s gaze, a battered girl has collapsed at Netsuhara’s feet.<br /> <br />Seeing Asahina-san’s eyes, Netsuhara seems delighted as he crouches and grabs the girl’s hair.<br /> <br />A rare albino girl with white hair.<br /> <br />With her hair seized and face raised, numerous bruises from being punched are engraved on it.<br /> <br />Her cheeks are swollen, and blood is flowing from the corner of her mouth as if her internal organs are damaged.<br /> <br />Even the usually calm Karasuma shows anger at that sight… The rage Asahina-san, the embodiment of justice, feels must exceed even my expectations.<br /> <br />“Don’t get so worked up, Asahina Kasumi. I’m allowed to do stuff like this, hear me out? No matter how much this chick gets hit, her answer is ‘I’m fine!’ ain’t that right! Gyeheheh!”<br /> <br />If the victim says they ‘forgive’ it even after violence is committed, it doesn’t break the school rules.<br /> <br />After the exchanges between Kirido and me, all of Class C understands how things work.<br /> <br />Therefore, Asahina-san felt even greater anger. She clenched her fist in rage.<br /> <br />“That’s enough… Let’s begin quickly, Netsuhara Eien. I can’t find any value in talking with you anymore. In the name of justice, I will defeat you.”<br /> <br />“Ooh… Then let’s get started quick! Hey, bring out the ‘Participating Students List!'”<br /> <br />Saying that, Netsuhara hops out to the center.<br /> <br />Class A and C each prepared a paper beforehand listing ‘the participating students’ names and order’, which would be revealed on the day itself.<br /> <br />In other words, neither side knows the opponent’s participating students or their order at this point.<br /> <br />The same is true for the other side, so there is absolutely no handicap due to these rules.<br /> <br />–Or so it seemed.<br /> <br />To ensure impartial adjudication, some student council students have undertaken the role of judges.<br /> <br />With an expressionless face, the girl student looks between the two sides.<br /> <br />“Now then, both sides announce your participating students.”<br /> <br />And so, Asahina and Netsuhara make it public.<br /> <br />The participating students lists for this time float overhead.<br /> <br />And as expected…it was just as I had imagined.<br /> <br />…Except for one part.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Class 1-C] [Class 1-A]<br /> <br />1 Asahina Kasumi 1 Tachibana Tsukihime<br /> <br />2 Sakuma Jyunya 2 Netsuhara Eien<br /> <br />3 Amamori Yuuto 3 Robert Beckio<br /> <br />4 Kurotsuki kanade 4 Kurenai Akiha<br /> <br />5 Karasuma Touji 5 Yoneda Hanbee<br /> <br />6 Raku Ichiraku 6 Mai Shinren<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />“Wha…!”<br /> <br />Asahina-san raises a startled voice. …But hold on a second.<br /> <br />Huh? Isn’t there a familiar name in there?<br /> <br />Eh, could I be seeing things? Did my eyes go bad?<br /> <br />It looks like Amamori Yuuto, but is this an illusion?<br /> <br />“…Just what is the meaning of this?”<br /> <br />“Let me explain!”<br /> <br />Our boss, Tendou-san, somehow picks up on my murmuring.<br /> <br />“Our alliance this time, you could say, has a powerful resilience blessed by heaven! But heaven cried out saying ‘There are strong ability user girls but facing Netsuhara would be scary, right!'”<br /> <br />“I see, a reserve slot.”<br /> <br />In other words ‘There are plenty of strong people in the class but having the girls face Netsuhara is dangerous, right?’ By the way, seems Asahina-san isn’t considered a girl.<br /> <br />I briefly slide my gaze and as expected, my eyes meet Kurashiki’s.<br /> <br />For me who absolutely doesn’t want to participate, it’s clearly some kind of enforced measure like ‘Hey you, take some responsibility and help clean up this mess.’ …I wonder how on earth they schemed this.<br /> <br />They probably did a lot of behind-the-scenes work without my consent to force in my name like this, but I’d like to know honestly how they managed it.<br /> <br />While thinking that, I feel Asahina-san’s fury transmitted over.<br /> <br />“Wh-What is the meaning of this! Netsuhara Eien!”<br /> <br />“No ‘what’ or ‘how’ about it! This is reality!”<br /> <br />Receiving his words, I look over the participating students list again.<br /> <br />Hmm. Robert Beckio huh. Looking at Class A, there’s one foreigner-looking guy with big muscles over 2 meters tall.<br /> <br />Well, it’s an elimination tournament and if Asahina-san defeats everyone then that’s fine but…<br /> <br />“…That’s probably impossible.”<br /> <br />I mutter and gaze at Asahina-san.<br /> <br />Netsuhara makes eye contact with the classmates behind him.<br /> <br />Then the albino girl from earlier, whose hair he had seized, heads toward the center supported by another student’s shoulder. Her name will become clear immediately from the flow.<br /> <br />“Masaka…! Tachibana-san is…”<br /> <br />“Ah, it’s her. Asahina Kasumi, your opponent is this chick.”<br /> <br />Netsuhara is smiling convinced of his victory.<br /> <br />Certainly Asahina-san is strong… But before that, she is a hero of justice, for better or worse.<br /> <br />That’s why, no matter how strong she is against evil… She can’t be strong against the same justice, against the weak.<br /> <br />No matter what, benevolent weaklings are ‘beings to protect’ for her.<br /> <br />Asahina-san clenches her fist and grits her teeth.<br /> <br />She seems to have just now realized…that she’s been trapped.<br /> <br />“I noticed it the moment I first went to your class. You aren’t the same as the guy who killed off Kirido. After all, you can’t fully become heartless. With ‘evil’ like me right before your eyes, taking justice’s side is unthinkably useless, ain’t it?”<br /> <br />Saying that, Netsuhara steps back.<br /> <br />What remained were the heavily wounded albino girl…Tachibana, and Asahina-san.<br /> <br />Asahina-san opens her eyes wide, hands clenched.<br /> <br />Blood is dripping from those fists.<br /> <br />More than hatred, vexation showed on her face.<br /> <br />“This is…bad.”<br /> <br />I hear Kurashiki’s voice and close my eyes.<br /> <br />From Asahina-san’s explanation, Netsuhara had emphasized quite a bit about ‘crushing them with his own hands.’ And he had done that extremely skillfully.<br /> <br />That’s why Asahina-san was completely deceived.<br /> <br />She believed the untrustworthy words of evil.<br /> <br />Unease runs through Class 1-C.<br /> <br />Netsuhara Eien was already convinced of his victory.<br /> <br />“Let me say this, my pawns will never surrender.”<br /> <br />That was likely synonymous with checkmate.<br /> <br />Asahina-san opens her eyes wide in shock and stares at Netsuhara.<br /> <br />He lifts his lips in a bow shape and along with a mocking tone announces:<br /> <br />“Asahina Kasumi, you can’t hit the ‘weak.'”<br /> <br />Asahina Kasumi has to defeat Tachibana Tsukihime.<br /> <br />Faced with that fact, Asahina Kasumi froze up.<br /> <br />Anyone could see it. Tachibana Tsukihime is a victim of Netsuhara Eien’s.<br /> <br />Her cheeks are swollen, blood is oozing slightly from her forehead. She hugs her shoulder as if a bone is broken, trembling. Her hair roughly seized sticks up irregularly, conveying heavy injuries all over her body.<br /> <br />To Asahina Kasumi, she is someone who should be protected.<br /> <br />But Tachibana Tsukihime will not say ‘I give up.’<br /> <br />That’s because Netsuhara Eien is frightening. She will never voluntarily surrender because he is frightening.<br /> <br />In other words, for Asahina to win, she has to punch and knock out Tachibana.<br /> <br />She has to raise her hand against one who justice should protect.<br /> <br />Unless she does that, Asahina Kasumi cannot fight Netsuhara Eien.<br /> <br />“…Kh, this is…!”<br /> <br />“Man, the loser dog is barking. Can’t do anything unless the situation suits them huh.”<br /> <br />Netsuhara shows a composed expression from afar.<br /> <br />Seeing him, Asahina-san strongly grinds her teeth. She squeezes her fist to the limit and turns her gaze to Tachibana before her eyes… That was the last resistance Asahina-san could manage.<br /> <br />“…Tachibana Tsukihime-san was it… Please surrender.”<br /> <br />“…N-No, I can’t…!”<br /> <br />Tachibana, who now refIn response to Asahina’s words, Tachibana displayed an almost excessive reaction.<br /> <br />Fear was evident in his eyes. On the other hand, Netsu was composed, never once faltering… I stared at this slightly chilling scene with a blank expression.<br /> <br />“…Y-You, please rest assured. If I, defeat Netsuhara kun, Tachibana Tukihime, then you will be freed from violence! Then, you won’t have to be afraid anymore—”<br /> <br />“Y-You… you can’t… absolutely, can’t win against… Class A…!”<br /> <br />Tachibana no longer seemed to be listening.<br /> <br />Asahina widened her eyes and stumbled over her words.<br /> <br />In response, the unease around them turned to despair.<br /> <br />Even their classmates would have understood by now.<br /> <br />Asahina couldn’t defeat Tachibana Tukihime… She would lose, surely be defeated.<br /> <br />Because there was no other way to avoid harming “Tachibana Tukihime.”<br /> <br />What foolishness. What naivety. …What a farce.<br /> <br />But then again, this is what being a hero is all about.<br /> <br />You had aspired to that fantasy, and so the hardships you’re about to face are beyond measure.<br /> <br />…I won’t blame you, Asahina Kasumi. I knew it was going to be like this.<br /> <br />You have lived righteously up to this point.<br /> <br />You’ve spoken rightly and acted rightly. Therefore, the crisis you’re facing is also just.<br /> <br />No matter who the opponent is, sooner or later, these moments would come.<br /> <br />And I thought, if you’re going to experience defeat anyway, it’s better sooner rather than later.<br /> <br />So I didn’t say anything either. Because this time, I’m also certain Asahina will be defeated.<br /> <br />“Sakuma.”<br /> <br />I call out to Sakuma nearby.<br /> <br />He turns to look at me in surprise, but seeing my eyes, he freezes for a few seconds before letting out a big sigh.<br /> <br />“…Geez, no choice I guess.”<br /> <br />While vigorously scratching his head, he starts walking toward Asahina.<br /> <br />Attention is focused on Sakuma. Netsuhara’s smile deepens further but he doesn’t look particularly interested.<br /> <br />Sakuma places a hand on Asahina’s shoulder, and she greatly shakes her body.<br /> <br />“Yo, hero of justice. We’re switching out.”<br /> <br />“S-Sakuma-kun? B-But, this is…”<br /> <br />“Nothing ‘but’ about it… Admit it plainly. This time, you fell for Netsuhara’s scheme. I hate cocky bastards and guys in denial.”</p>

<p>As expected of Sakuma, his mouth is foul. One wrong step could earn him boos, but he avoids mistakes and that’s why he stands at the top of the class hierarchy.<br /> <br />He glares at Netsuhara and lifts the corner of his mouth.<br /> <br />“…Well, it’s good in a way. Guys like him piss me off the most. Asahina, you could’ve killed him alone but… He’s the one guy I really wanted to finish off myself.”<br /> <br />“S-Sakuma-kun…”<br /> <br />Sakuma, your phrasing is awful. Kind of brutal.<br /> <br />But you said something good. Asahina-san’s favorability went up a little! Keep drawing all of Asahina-san’s attention, I’ll be very grateful. I’m sincerely cheering you on!<br /> <br />“Oi judge! Asahina withdraws, we’re switching out!”<br /> <br />“…Is that alright, Asahina Kasumi-san?”<br /> <br />At the judge student’s words, Asahina-san bites her lip.<br /> <br />Her gaze turns this way.<br /> <br />The students around are all looking at Asahina-san.<br /> <br />What’s reflected in their eyes isn’t contempt…not at all.<br /> <br />“Well, no choice but to leave it to Sakuma now!”<br /> <br />“That’s right! You can do your best next, Asahina-san!”<br /> <br />“Yeah! Don’t worry about it too much!”<br /> <br />“We discussed the plan with Asahina-san too, so it’s our responsibility as well!”<br /> <br />Encouragement rings out from around her.<br /> <br />With tears in her eyes from that, Asahina-san answers the judge.<br /> <br />“………Y-Yes. I surrender.”<br /> <br />Laughter echoes from Netsuhara in the distance upon those words.<br /> <br />The judge nods, and the hero of justice is defeated without even fighting.<br /> <br />Returning to our encampment, she looks so small compared to her usual self that it’s hard to believe she’s the same person. Like the flickering flame of a candle that seems it could vanish with a light puff… Seeing our classmates get so worried makes me grow uneasy too for some reason.<br /> <br />…Well, if Sakuma loses, I’m next right? Considering and still choosing to ‘say nothing,’ I hold some responsibility too.<br /> <br />Asahina-san passes by me.<br /> <br />At that time, I tell her just one thing.<br /> <br />“Leave the rest to Sakuma.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Yeeeaahh, Class A’s surrendering too! Since Tachibana lost, next up is the one you guys hate, Netsuhara Eien!”<br /> </p>

<p><br /> <br />…Sakuma isn’t a bad guy but he’s not a hero of justice.<br /> <br />He probably could have defeated Tachibana if he tried. It would pain him but he could have knocked her out.<br /> <br />That’s why Netsuhara withdrew Tachibana so readily.<br /> <br />He hops out to the center, and violently pushes aside Tachibana who was walking with dragging feet.<br /> <br />“Kyaa!”<br /> <br />“Oi, you…!”<br /> <br />Seeing that, Sakuma flies into a rage but Netsuhara doesn’t give a damn.<br /> <br />He whistles leisurely, acting nonchalant, and his eyes don’t even reflect Sakuma’s figure.<br /> <br />Seeing him blatantly looking down on them, Sakuma’s temple throbs with blue veins.<br /> <br />“I wanted to settle things with you with this fist…”<br /> <br />“Huh! I’m not thinking anything really. After all, you’re gonna lose right? I’ll probably forget a loser dog’s face completely by tomorrow.”<br /> <br />The usual taunting, condescending attitude.<br /> <br />Faced with that, Sakuma takes a deep breath.<br /> <br />–And burns his body with flames… No, he’s wrapped in flames?<br /> <br />I can feel scorching heat even from a dozen meters away.<br /> <br />Unconsciously, we retreat and Netsuhara whistles “Hyuu.”<br /> <br />“Oh, so that’s your ‘special power’ huh.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, remember this, shithead. [Lava King], the power that will defeat you.”<br /> <br />It’s the authority of a king who governs all manner of heat.<br /> <br />If it were me, I’d probably be burnt to death just from trying to touch it.<br /> <br />While thinking that…I glanced at Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />He’s…looking the day after tomorrow’s direction disinterestedly.<br /> <br />As if he has no interest whatsoever in this fight or its outcome.<br /> <br />Seeing his attitude, I scratch my head.<br /> <br />My classmates’ attention has already shifted to Sakuma.<br /> <br />Not exaggerating, among the clearly stated abilities after Asahina-san and Kurotsuki’s, it’s cheat-level power.<br /> <br />It would be stranger to not expect anything.<br /> <br />But I’ll move assuming defeat.<br /> <br />If Sakuma loses–…I’m next to be crushed.<br /> <br />If I’m crushed, I won’t be able to accomplish or leave behind anything.<br /> <br />So while Sakuma is fighting, I’ll try to finish setting everything up.<br /> <br />Asahina Kasumi’s defeat, Class C’s disadvantageous position, Netsuhara’s unknown special power.<br /> <br />Taking all that into account, I conclude again.<br /> <br />This is the only time to bring in Kurotsuki kanade.<br /> <br />I briefly glance at Kurashiki and see she’s also looking at me.<br /> <br />There’s not a shred of ‘impatience’ in her expression.<br /> <br />Because she knows I’m participating?<br /> <br />If so, don’t get your hopes up too much. If that Sakuma can’t win then I probably can’t beat Netsuhara either. Most likely, almost certainly.<br /> <br />So if you’re going to expect anything, expect it from Kurotsuki rather than me.<br /> <br />I head toward Kurotsuki standing alone in the distance and stop in front of him.<br /> <br />He looks at me surprised and I address him expressionlessly.<br /> <br />“Kurotsuki kanade, let’s talk.”<br /> <br />“…Talk, you say?”<br /> <br />At my proposal, Kurotsuki openly shows vigilance.<br /> <br />Of course, he knows about my irregularity, if only a little.<br /> <br />I intentionally avoided, received, and endured his attack. With my bare flesh.<br /> <br />So he’s surely ‘wary’ of me now.<br /> <br />For better or worse.<br /> <br />“…Sorry but I have nothing in particular to talk about–“<br /> <br />I don’t let him finish.<br /> <br />“I have something, even if you don’t.”<br /> <br />He looks at me dumbfounded…and then opens his eyes wide.<br /> <br />I don’t know what he saw in my eyes.<br /> <br />A genius like him might have found something even in my ordinary eyes.<br /> <br />But I’m not interested. I don’t care about stuff like that.<br /> <br />There’s only one thing I’m interested in.<br /> <br />While staring straight at him, I ask him a single question.<br /> <br />“What are you living for?”<br /> <br />It was likely more philosophical than I expected.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Kurotsuki kanade was a genius from birth.<br /> <br />He could do most things as long as he saw them once.<br /> <br />Even as a beginner, he could do the same as veterans.<br /> <br />In sports too, after watching just once he could join the team.<br /> <br />He was able to be active as the team’s ace.<br /> <br />It was the same with studying. Just properly listening in class let him get full marks.<br /> <br />He could achieve the highest scores without any particular hardship.<br /> <br />How can you do it so well?<br /> <br />What’s the trick to getting good at something?<br /> <br />How can you study so much?<br /> <br />To his classmates’ childish questions.<br /> <br />Without being modest, boastful, or bragging.<br /> <br />“Because I’m a genius,” was his reply.<br /> <br />So rely on me more, is what he meant.<br /> <br />I want to use this talent for everyone’s sake.<br /> <br />Because it’s power to make everyone smile.<br /> <br />…That’s why he couldn’t understand.<br /> <br />–Why was he…crying?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Two years ago. Kurotsuki had a boy who could be called his best friend.<br /> <br />“Yo kanade! Let’s stop by the game center on the way home!”<br /> <br />“…Itsuki, there’s no game center around here.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki gently smiles as he responds to the boy called Itsuki. Itsuki as usual shows a friendly smile and says “Oh right.”<br /> <br />In a small town in Hokkaido. A town so small the students are separated into just two classes per grade.<br /> <br />That’s where Kurotsuki kanade lived.<br /> <br />His talent was widely recognized among his friends and teachers.<br /> <br />Yet he himself just remained a ‘local celebrity,’ staying modest.<br /> <br />He didn’t even consider going out into the world and being active.<br /> <br />If he could live helping those close by, Kurotsuki was satisfied with that.<br /> <br />“Morning you two! No dozing off today huh!”<br /> <br />The one who called out to the two was a female classmate.<br /> <br />“Hehe! I had time to spare since there was no morning practice today!”<br /> <br />“Well I never doze off during class, kanae.”<br /> <br />The girl called kanae happily smiles at the two’s replies.<br /> <br />kanae was Itsuki’s childhood friend.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki who transferred in during elementary school had known her for nearly five years now.<br /> <br />You could call it fate. From when he transferred in elementary school until now, the three had always ended up in the same class without ever being separated.<br /> <br />“Geez Itsuki! We have tests coming up soon so you have to study properly! Oh right, kanade can you tutor us?”<br /> <br />“H-Hey! You just casually asked kanade instead of me! I was gonna ask first–“<br /> <br />“Yes yes, you two calm down. Or rather, shouldn’t you study on your own?”<br /> <br />He had no intention of refusing from the start of course.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki said that jokingly.<br /> <br />“”We’ll get failing marks (if we do that)!?””<br /> <br />Their voices overlap. It’s the well-timed comedic duo act of childhood friends, like a married couple.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki watches the two with a seemingly wry smile as he shrugs.<br /> <br />“Well, I don’t have much confidence in teaching you well. Since you two don’t study, even the basics are lacking.”<br /> <br />It was terrible acting.<br /> <br />He’s certainly confident.<br /> <br />But as their important friend, he’s telling them indirectly ‘You should study more daily.’<br /> <br />…Well, it seems they didn’t get that vague message though.<br /> <br />“Huh? I’m more confident I can study than this guy though.”<br /> <br />“The hell you sayin’!? The guy who got 5 points on the last Japanese test–Guh!”<br /> <br />kanae’s elbow stabs into Itsuki’s gut.<br /> <br />Japanese, 5 points. …The disastrous result makes the class fall silent.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki looks at her as if to say ‘Are you sane?’ while Itsuki crouches down holding his stomach. A seemingly embarrassed kanae’s cheeks flush.<br /> <br />“Th-This is our…secret, okay?”<br /> <br />“No, everyone already kno–“<br /> <br />“I’m begging you kanade! If my scores drop any lower, my allowance will be cut!”<br /> <br />How could it drop any lower than this?<br /> <br />Kurotsuki swallows those words and answers with a sigh.<br /> <br />“…Got it. I’ll teach you within my ability.”<br /> <br />“Yes, thank yoou kanade!”<br /> <br />With tears in her eyes, kanae suddenly embraces Kurotsuki. Kurotsuki looks surprised and embarrassed while the seemingly impatient Itsuki raises his voice.<br /> <br />“Oi! Wh-What’re you doing! Hey, get off!”<br /> <br />“Ehh, what, don’t tell me you’re jealous? As if!”<br /> <br />“Hah!? Why would I be jealous of you!”<br /> <br />Once again, kanae’s elbow stabs into Itsuki’s gut.<br /> <br />Itsuki plays the fool and kanae goes along with it.<br /> <br />I’m always watching them and laughing.<br /> <br />It was a truly happy time.<br /> <br />It made my heart feel warm. An orange-colored world, warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>“H-Hey…help me…don’t just laugh…”<br /> <br />“Y-You alright? kanae, that’s a bit much…”<br /> <br />“Hmph! He won’t die from this level!”<br /> <br />“You trying to kill me!?”<br /> <br />Itsuki makes a fuss and they somehow end up laughing together. Before long, one by one, students start disappearing from the classroom. kanae’s club activity time starts approaching as well.<br /> <br />“Ah! It’s this late already… Sorry you two but I gotta go!<br /> <br />“Never come back again!”<br /> <br />“I’ll make sure to come back just to spite you!”<br /> <br />Saying that, kanae heads off to club activities.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki who wasn’t in any club and Itsuki whose club was off walk away together with no real reason.<br /> <br />“So yeah, about that TV show yesterday–“<br /> <br />Kurotsuki, now a high school first-year, speaks.<br /> <br />That time was probably the happiest.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Haah, haah… D-Damn…!”<br /> <br />Itsuki supported himself with his shoulders as he rested both hands on his knees.<br /> <br />Today in gym class was soccer.<br /> <br />Itsuki belongs to the soccer club. Piling up blood, sweat and tears, he had been the soccer club’s ace since his first year.<br /> <br />At least in effort, he was absolutely unbeatable.<br /> <br />He had confidence in that, and in his own ability. That’s why he was convinced no one in a mere gym class soccer game could be his match…<br /> <br />…At least until just now.<br /> <br />He wipes the sweat from his brow and looks ahead.<br /> <br />There, Kurotsuki shoots the ball into the enemy’s goal, with the yellow team letting out anguished screams.<br /> <br />Among them is kanae, and seeing her, Itsuki shows irritation.<br /> <br />“So cool, kanade Kurotsuki! And so lame, Itsuki!”<br /> <br />Hearing kanae’s voice, Kurotsuki wryly smiles.<br /> <br />“You’ll lose if you let it get to you. It’s just provocation.”<br /> <br />“I know, at least that much…”<br /> <br />But dissatisfaction still builds up inside even if he understands.<br /> <br />He knew Kurotsuki kanade was a genius… He thought his talent made him an unmatched opponent.<br /> <br />But does talent completely ignore all the effort he’s put in?<br /> <br />He spent much of his youth on the path of soccer.<br /> <br />And it crumbles before the single word of [Genius].<br /> <br />As just another ordinary boy, Itsuki grinds his molars.<br /> <br />Why, why can’t he play an active role?<br /> <br />Why can Kurotsuki play such an active role?<br /> <br />“Hey, kanade!”<br /> <br />“…Hm? What is it, Itsuki?”<br /> <br />The words came out before he could think.<br /> <br />Itsuki is at a loss under Kurotsuki’s puzzled return question.<br /> <br />Unable to follow up, in desperation he ends up asking something childish.<br /> <br />“H-How…can you do it so well?”<br /> <br />He knew it was an obvious question. Yes, Itsuki himself also understood that.<br /> <br />“L-Look, I’m in the soccer club right? Your movements and stuff…! I thought maybe I could reference them! If you’ve got any tips, teach me! We’re best friends right?”<br /> <br />Faced with the demanding Itsuki, Kurotsuki smiles wryly.<br /> <br />Seeing his expression, Itsuki opens his eyes wide and bites his lip.<br /> <br />That’s right, Kurotsuki is just an ordinary person despite being good, not in the soccer club or anything.<br /> <br />Why did he ask something like this? Asking a beginner for advice even though he’s my best friend in the soccer club. It must be hard for Kurotsuki to answer too, the one who should be teaching.<br /> <br />“S-Sorry! That just now was…”<br /> <br />Itsuki hurriedly tries to say ‘never mind’ and opens his mouth.<br /> <br />But before that, Kurotsuki’s answer came back.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Sorry, since I’m a genius…I don’t really know any tricks.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The moment he heard those words, his answer.<br /> <br />For some reason, Itsuki heard the sound of something breaking.<br /> <br />He doesn’t know what it was that broke.<br /> <br />But he can definitively declare it was something important that shouldn’t have broken.<br /> <br />“…Genius.”<br /> <br />With his mind a jumbled mess, he doesn’t even know what to think anymore.<br /> <br />Itsuki echoes the two characters Kurotsuki uttered.<br /> <br />Everyone recognized Kurotsuki was a genius. Itsuki understood that too.<br /> <br />But hearing it from his own mouth was completely different–<br /> <br />“…Itsuki? What’s wrong?”<br /> <br />“N-Nothing… Sorry for the weird question.”<br /> <br />Itsuki says that, then runs toward the ball.<br /> <br />The left behind Kurotsuki tilts his head puzzledly but soon runs after him.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki overtakes Itsuki shortly after starting to run.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–The next week, Itsuki had quit the soccer club.<br /> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Alright! Nice, kanae, kanade!”<br /> <br />Today was test return day.<br /> <br />Looking at his returned test, Itsuki seems happy and the two who saw Itsuki’s answer sheet show great surprise.<br /> <br />“No…way… You got over 90 on everything! D-Don’t tell me, you cheated…”<br /> <br />“I didn’t! I won’t dishonor everyone’s hard work by cheating.”<br /> <br />“Kidding. I know best how hard you were studying.”<br /> <br />After quitting club activities, Itsuki had been studying hard.<br /> <br />Because he was losing his ‘enjoyment’ of sports.<br /> <br />And he wanted to show kanae he could study properly too.<br /> <br />In sports, he would definitely never match up to kanade. Itsuki sensed that from years of experience.<br /> <br />So he would get back at him in studying at least.<br /> <br />See, I can do it too.<br /> <br />Itsuki turns his gaze to Kurotsuki in high spirits.<br /> <br />And there was Kurotsuki, making a complicated expression.<br /> <br />…The definite confidence changes color into bad premonition.<br /> <br />Like dropping a speck of mud into a pure white lake.<br /> <br />The bad feeling soon turns to conviction, and confidence is stained jet black.<br /> <br />“…No way, right?”<br /> <br />Itsuki didn’t know Kurotsuki’s usual test scores.<br /> <br />He knew he could study very well.<br /> <br />But since he himself was getting failing scores, he never bothered to specifically learn kanade’s scores. So he thought he must have won this time getting this high.<br /> <br />But he was wrong.<br /> <br />“Actually…”<br /> <br />The opened answer sheets were all perfect scores.<br /> <br />Even on problems made by the teacher thinking ‘They probably can’t answer this,’ he showed model answers.<br /> <br />They were answer sheets that no one could find fault with, scoring a ‘perfect 100 points.’<br /> <br />“A-Amazing! As expected of kanade, you really can study!”<br /> <br />“What do you mean ‘as expected,’ I’ve been saying it all along.”<br /> <br />Itsuki opens his eyes wide with a ‘Haah.’<br /> <br />His intuition was right, Kurotsuki says those words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Because I’m a genius, you know.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Those words had become a curse.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Because I’m a genius, you know.”<br /> <br />He had heard those words countless times.<br /> <br />Each time he heard those words, his heart felt constricted. His chest hurt, he felt nauseous.<br /> <br />He knows kanade doesn’t have any malice.<br /> <br />Itsuki doesn’t know a nicer guy than him.<br /> <br />He’s always prioritizing others. Earnestly thinking about how to help them.<br /> <br />Many people had been saved by him.<br /> <br />Itsuki and kanae had been saved not just once or twice.<br /> <br />Saved countless times. They were grateful too… Probably.<br /> <br />There’s no one in this town who doesn’t know him.<br /> <br />Because Kurotsuki kanade is this town’s hero.<br /> <br />…But still.<br /> <br />Whenever Kurotsuki’s words.<br /> <br />That line runs through his head.<br /> <br />It dyes his memories with kanade black.<br /> <br />And he feels anger boiling up.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“You haven’t been hanging out much lately huh, Itsuki.”<br /> <br />“Ah… Yeah, I guess so.”<br /> <br />After school. On the country road with just Itsuki and kanade after parting with kanae.<br /> <br />Frogs and insects can be heard chirping from the paddies on either side.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki had noticed Itsuki’s mood was off.<br /> <br />So he wanted to do something about it somehow.<br /> <br />To recreate their usual, happy times like normal.<br /> <br />“kanae said it too. ‘Itsuki’s been kinda hard to deal with lately right?’ …If something happened, tell me. We’re friends right?”<br /> <br />“…Ah, yeah.”<br /> <br />He gets the same response as before.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki smiles wryly as he searches for his next words.<br /> <br />And…notices that Itsuki had stopped walking.<br /> <br />“…What’s wrong, Itsuki?”<br /> <br />“………Hey, have you ever studied before?”<br /> <br />It was a sudden question.<br /> <br />Understandably puzzled, Kurotsuki answers honestly.<br /> <br />“N-No… Not particularly?”<br /> <br />“Then sports… Have you ever desperately trained to the point of death? Struggled sleeplessly because you didn’t want to lose to someone–“<br /> <br />“I-I haven’t but… What about it…?”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki seems to recoil slightly as he responds.<br /> <br />At his words, at his attitude, Itsuki’s anger explodes.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Don’t fuck with me!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Kurotsuki opens his eyes wide at the sudden outburst.<br /> <br />“Why, why! kanade Kurotsuki! Do you know how hard I’m trying!? While you’re…while you’re playing with kanae, I’m desperately studying! While you’re casually slacking off, I’m desperately struggling…! I even quit club activities, threw away everything and am working hard…! Yet you…!”<br /> <br />“I-Itsuki…?”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki’s confused voice flies out.<br /> <br />Receiving that voice, Itsuki returns to his senses and opens his eyes wide.<br /> <br />It takes several seconds to understand what he had said.<br /> <br />Eventually covering his mouth, Itsuki whispers “Sorry” to Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />But the true feelings once spilled out can’t be taken back anymore.<br /> <br />“…You probably can’t understand, huh.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki couldn’t reply to Itsuki’s words.<br /> <br />Because they were right.<br /> <br />“You’re a genius who can do anything. While I’m just a mediocre person. I can’t do anything, and no matter how desperately I struggle… I could never reach you.”<br /> <br />Before long, the lowered Itsuki raises his face.<br /> <br />“Why, why…”<br /> <br />“I like kanae,”<br /> <br />He knew. And couldn’t understand.<br /> <br />Why, why was he telling him this now of all times.<br /> <br />Why, is he…crying?<br /> <br />“I wanted to become someone fitting for her, so I worked hard desperately. …Did you know? She’s the track club’s ace. Working hard day after day… While I’m just a mediocre person with nothing going for me. At least, I wanted one weapon that was better than anyone else’s.”<br /> <br />“Itsuki…I-I…”<br /> <br />“I know you’ve been cheering us on. That kanae is worried about me. But, but, yo…”<br /> <br />He was crying. On the deserted country road at dusk…the one who was once his best friend sobs painfully.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I hate you so much…I can’t stand it!”</p>

<p>It was an ugly jealousy.<br /> <br />Something Kurotsuki had experienced no small number of times before.<br /> <br />But this time was different.<br /> <br />Receiving greater hatred than anyone else from a best friend he truly trusted.<br /> <br />It was an emotion too heavy for his second year of middle school self.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />There was a crisp, strange sound.<br /> <br />Something important of Kurotsuki kanade’s broke.<br /> <br />When he realized it, Kurotsuki was running.<br /> <br />Itsuki’s voice calling out to stop echoes from behind.<br /> <br />Saying ‘Sorry’ ‘Went too far’ ‘Please, listen to what I have to say’<br /> <br />Ignoring all those words, Kurotsuki ran.<br /> <br />Ran and ran.<br /> <br />Straight home, he shut himself in his room.<br /> <br />From that day, Kurotsuki never left the house.<br /> <br />Nearly every day, Itsuki and kanae came to Kurotsuki’s room.<br /> <br />Voices apologizing could be heard, the mood of someone crying.<br /> <br />There were two sincerely worrying about him.<br /> <br />But the door never opened again.<br /> <br />The room door remained closed shut.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki would never show his face to the two again.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Before long, time passed and it was spring of their third year of middle school.<br /> <br />I heard a rumor that Kurotsuki was in a different class than those two for the first time.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“What are you living for?”<br /> <br />I ask Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />At my words, he trembles and lowers his face.<br /> <br />“…I don’t really understand what you mean but,”<br /> <br />“Let me rephrase it. Why are you hiding your talent?”<br /> <br />At my words, he raises his face.<br /> <br />In his eyes is a black light like he had lost something.<br /> <br />Rather than something, it may have been ‘someone’ though.<br /> <br />…Yeah, his eyes really resemble mine after all.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki looking down at me also seems to have noticed something.<br /> <br />“Y-You, could it be…”<br /> <br />“Hey, Kurotsuki kanade. What do you think about that?”<br /> <br />I turn my gaze toward the battle between Netsuhara and Sakuma.<br /> <br />Sakuma’s special power is [Lava King].<br /> <br />A cheat ability to almost completely nullify flame-type powers, and freely summon, control, and manipulate things like lava and flames. It’s a special power that would normally be impossible to match.<br /> <br />But looking at that, Netsuhara’s power is probably…<br /> <br />“…Sakuma-kun looks to be at a disadvantage.”<br /> <br />Currently, the center of the battle is wrapped in crimson flames.<br /> <br />Lava flows across the ground, intense red flames push back the air. Just being in that spot would burn your feet and sear your lungs… A normal person probably couldn’t survive even a few minutes.<br /> <br />Yet amidst that, Netsuhara Eien is laughing.<br /> <br />“…The flames, lava, heat…it’s all being nullified. Netsuhara-kun’s power is likely a complete upgrade of Sakuma-kun’s.”<br /> <br />“…The highest tier of heat abilities–a [Blessing] power.”<br /> <br />In other words, equal to Asahina-san and Kurotsuki’s level.<br /> <br />With compatibility and all, it doesn’t look like Sakuma has a chance.<br /> <br />Rather, the other students probably can’t do anything either.<br /> <br />I briefly glance over and see Asahina looking like she’s about to die as she watches Sakuma.<br /> <br />“…This battle will likely end in Class C’s defeat.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki voices a weak opinion.<br /> <br />But looking at the situation objectively, I can’t deny his statement.<br /> <br />The problem is, if we lose with just this, Asahina-san might say something like ‘I’ll take responsibility and withdraw.’<br /> <br />There are still things I need her to do.<br /> <br />She has to survive this and grow.<br /> <br />…And I’m low on cash so I can’t pay the 200,000 yen if we lose either.<br /> <br />That’s why I need you this time, Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />“If there’s anyone who can beat Netsuhara, it’s you, Kurotsuki…no one else.”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki silently responds to my words.<br /> <br />I don’t know what happened in the past.<br /> <br />Nor what he’s thinking about as he lives now. Or why he came to this school.<br /> <br />I don’t know anything, and have no interest. –But I’m convinced of this much.<br /> <br />You’re intentionally suppressing your own talent.<br /> <br />“Guhaah…!?”<br /> <br />“Hmmm? I haven’t used my power yet thoo?”<br /> <br />Netsuhara’s fist stabs into Sakuma’s gut.<br /> <br />His body bends like a bow from the immense force, Sakuma staggers back panting.<br /> <br />Netsuhara who had cornered the King’s power without using his ability even once.<br /> <br />…He seems much stronger than I assumed.<br /> <br />“I…I’m a genius. I’ve known that for a long time now.”<br /> <br />Suddenly, I hear Kurotsuki’s voice. Looking over, he’s hugging his shoulders and trembling.<br /> <br />He must have had tremendous trauma.<br /> <br />With him quivering like this, I’m sure nothing I say would reach him.<br /> <br />“That’s why I hate this talent. Think about it. Think…why did I make him cry. What did I do wrong. I pondered it forever. And realized. Surely Itsuki was corrupted by my talent.”<br /> <br />Itsuki? I couldn’t ask who that is based on the mood.<br /> <br />“In middle school…I had publicly flaunted my talent without really thinking. If I can help someone, I thought. But the result was…jealousy, resentment, anger from my best friend. It’s laughable, right Amamori-kun? I…was hated by my best friend and ran far away.”<br /> <br />He seems frightened. But not of his own talent…<br /> <br />He’s afraid that his talent will end up hurting someone again.<br /> <br />“I…don’t want to use this kind of talent anymore…”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki kanade says in a mosquito-like voice.</p>







<p><br /> <br />“Rather than losing something, I don’t need talent. It’s fine even if I can’t do anything! Because I lost everything wishing selfishly… This talent drove Itsuki mad… Something like this, something like this…!”<br /> <br />He trembles his shoulders, holding back tears. He is afraid like the adolescent boy he is.<br /> <br />It’s a side far different from the [Lone Genius] he shows in Class 1-C.<br /> <br />Now that I think about it, he probably maintained that attitude so as to not hurt anyone anymore. Killing himself, succumbing to kindness, donning the pelt of a lone wolf.<br /> <br />That was the surface image we saw of Kurotsuki kanade.<br /> <br />“Those eyes…j-just imagining them, I’m…scared…”<br /> <br />I don’t need to imagine what happened in his past, I have no intention of finding out.<br /> <br />I avert my gaze from him and look at the battlefield.<br /> <br />“It seems…the match is over.”<br /> <br />Before my eyes, Netsuhara’s fist stabs into Sakuma’s gut.<br /> <br />Yet another direct hit, the past his limit Sakuma drops to his knees and sinks down.<br /> <br />However, before the judge can announce Sakuma’s defeat.<br /> <br />…Netsuhara tramples and laughs on Sakuma’s head.<br /> <br />“It’s over! Sakuma-kun who’s been acting like Kirido’s successor couldn’t make me use my power even once and was defeated! Good work~”<br /> <br />Despair spills from the classmates at that scene.<br /> <br />Of course, Sakuma was one of the top combatants in Class C.<br /> <br />That even he couldn’t get Netsuhara to use his power.<br /> <br />…Frankly, this is bad. What the hell, aren’t this guy’s combat parameters bugged?<br /> <br />I have to fight someone like this next?<br /> <br />“O-Oi, Sakuma! You alright!?”<br /> <br />Karasuma shouts in frustration. But such screams are sweet nectar to Netsuhara.<br /> <br />He distorts his expression in delight and kicks Sakuma’s body toward Class C’s side.<br /> <br />Asahina-san hurriedly moves and catches Sakuma’s body but… Sakuma is completely unconscious. From here it looks like quite serious injuries.<br /> <br />“Class A, Netsuhara Eien. Excessive violence that defies common sense cannot be permitted… If you continue showing immoral conduct, you will be declared the loser.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Don’t remember any kinda rule like that but…fine, I get it. With this, two people I wanted to crush are out. The rest are small fries not even worth provoking. I’ll crush you in an instant–Now then, who’s next!?”<br /> <br />Netsuhara’s loud voice echoes, and I step forward.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki kanade looks at me with widened eyes.<br /> <br />“Kurotsuki. You were saying something about talent but… In short, you mean ‘Because I’m superior to anyone else, I don’t want to get serious’ right?”<br /> <br />“Y-Yeah…I guess, but–“<br /> <br />His words grow disjointed.<br /> <br />Looking back, he’s trembling as he looks at me.<br /> <br />“Then good. –You pass, Kurotsuki kanade.”<br /> <br />If I can say that much then there’s no problem. I’ll take you as having the qualifications to stand beside me.<br /> <br />Though you were saying complicated stuff, the gist is you just need someone stronger than you to appear right?<br /> <br />If you go all out, use up all your power, yet still face an insurmountable wall.<br /> <br />If there’s a man walking ahead of you, then you can fight seriously. That’s what you mean right?<br /> <br />Hey, Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />You’re certainly a genius.<br /> <br />But you know too little of the world.<br /> <br />I know plenty of geniuses at your level.<br /> <br />I even know geniuses so great you look like an infant before them.<br /> <br />…Though unfortunately, I’m not a genius or anything.<br /> <br />At the very least, I’m–much stronger than you.<br /> <br />“Now then, it’s my turn.”<br /> <br />I start walking toward Netsuhara.<br /> <br />I see Kurashiki open her eyes wide.<br /> <br />But the greater surprise seems to be from my classmates.<br /> <br />“A-Amamori-kun…!”<br /> <br />“Oi Amamori! Weren’t you watching!? Sakuma didn’t stand a chance…!”<br /> <br />Asahina-san strongly grasps my hand as I walk. Karasuma who was examining Sakuma yells, and I nod.<br /> <br />“I don’t know if even Kurotsuki can win, so come at me with as little strength as possible.”<br /> <br />Saying that, I shake off their restraints and step forward.<br /> <br />Seeing my face, Netsuhara looks a little surprised.<br /> <br />He probably investigated me too when searching for the ‘one who got Kirido expelled.’<br /> <br />With the weakest ability, and thoroughly ordinary academic and physical abilities, seemingly talentless. That’s probably the impression he has of me.<br /> <br />“Oi oi, for real…? You sane?”<br /> <br />“If I’m not sane, would I be insane?”<br /> <br />When I say that, Netsuhara laughs happily.<br /> <br />Like a carefree child given a new toy.<br /> <br />But that innocence changes to madness in light of the current situation.<br /> <br />“This is great, a new duck’s come with its neck presented! You were Asahina’s favorite right? How’s she gonna cry when I crush you right before her eyes?”<br /> <br />“Amamori-kun! P-Please…! I’ll take responsibility so please surrender…! Netsuhara-kun is much more–than Kirido-kun…!”<br /> <br />Hearing Asahina-san’s scream, Netsuhara’s smile deepens further.<br /> <br />Uh oh, he’s raring to hunt huh.<br /> <br />But well, I have things to do too. Normally I’d surrender and say ‘I lost’ but just this once, I can’t withdraw so simply.<br /> </p>

<p>Due to the intense heat, I evade the attack and take distance.<br /> <br />The heat immediately moves away and I deeply inhale.<br /> <br />“My power…is the ultimate spear and shield. Flames that destroy all, flames that burn everything! Iron skin that withstands all, boasting invulnerability! With molten iron, I’m unrivaled! That’s me! Netsuhara Eien!”<br /> <br />Disregarding the blood flowing from his nose, he charges at me.<br /> <br />With that much heat, even I can’t endure it for long.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-kun! That’s too dangerous! Please… surrender…!”<br /> <br />“Amamori! Don’t worry about what happens later! We’re the ones left! you did well …… without even using your powers! leave the rest to us, just surrender!”<br /> <br />Asahina-san and Karasuma’s voices rang out.<br /> <br />Voices flew from other students I had never spoken to before.<br /> <br />This seems to be my limit, the utmost I can do right now… Or so it must look.<br /> <br />When I turned my gaze to Kurotsuki, he was shaking his head from side to side.<br /> <br />It’s enough, stop already. You absolutely can’t beat Atsuhara as you are now.<br /> <br />Those feelings were transparently visible… Yet I didn’t run away.<br /> <br />“…You still won’t acknowledge it?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Are we done with this game of tag?”<br /> <br />Seeing me stop running away, Atsuhara’s smile deepened.<br /> <br />In response, I relaxed my shoulders and took a deep breath.<br /> <br />Hey, Kurotsuki. If you were in this situation, could you beat Atsuhara barehanded?<br /> <br />If your answer is “I could”, then I’ll give up. If you can beat a monster like him barehanded, you must be a genius beyond my capabilities.<br /> <br />But if you think you can’t,<br /> <br />Then know this – we have no chance of winning. Burn that into your eyes.<br /> <br />I raised my fists. Atsuhara reacted slightly, then slowly closed the distance between us.<br /> <br />“I’ll torture ‘n slaughter ya real slow. Any last words? Nah, don’t beg for your life or nothin’.”<br /> <br />“Well… What if I said I had martial arts training?”<br /> <br />An obvious lie.<br /> <br />Atsuhara raised an eyebrow, but didn’t show any major reaction.<br /> <br />Clenching his fist, he looked down on me with irritation and anger.<br /> <br />“…Tch, you still think you can win? I take back what I said earlier. More than Asahina or that worm from before… Amamori, you’re the one I hate the most. Enough. I’ll go all out― and fucking kill you!”<br /> <br />His dull iron body swelled to even greater proportions.<br /> <br />Atsuhara, who had been about the same height as me, was now easily over 2 meters.<br /> <br />A towering body I had to look up to see, muscles of iron that looked ready to burst. Overwhelming weight.<br /> <br />No matter how you looked at it, he was the picture of bloodthirsty killing intent.<br /> <br />“Amamori-kun…!”<br /> <br />“During an ongoing conflict, Class C students are forbidden from interfering. If you intend to break the rules, it will result in Class C’s unconditional defeat.”<br /> <br />The female student referee turned her gaze to me. Her eyes met mine; she hadn’t broken a sweat.<br /> <br />“Amamori Yuuto… I advise you surrender. You will die.”<br /> <br />“Thank you for the warning.”<br /> <br />With that said, I returned my eyes to Atsuhara.<br /> <br />Killing intent filled his eyes. He raised an enormous fist, swollen to nearly 1 meter in size.<br /> <br />Searing heat charred my skin and scorched my lungs. My eyeballs were at their limit.<br /> <br />The visual pressure, on top of it all, forced me to squeeze my eyes shut.<br /> <br />“Die, Brave Iron Fist!”<br /> <br />An enormous mass of heat came crashing down.<br /> <br />A direct hit would mean instant death. I was certain of the power assaulting me.<br /> <br />Even with eyes closed, I knew death was imminent.<br /> <br />Did Atsuhara think he had secured victory?<br /> <br />Would Asahina-san try to intervene?<br /> <br />Could Kurotsuki see this scene?<br /> <br />What an― absolutely perfect chance. This is the best, Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> <br />I believed if I pushed you into a corner, you would react like this.<br /> <br />I clench my fist and open my eyes.<br /> <br />I too threw a straight right punch to meet the enormous fist plunging towards me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In that moment, the impact reverberated through me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A dull sound, like colliding solid objects.<br /> <br />The giant fist and my thin arm’s small fist.<br /> <br />Yet somehow, the two were deadlocked.<br /> <br />“Wha―”<br /> <br />Atsuhara’s shock rippled outwards.<br /> <br />But well, it’s a bit too soon to be surprised.<br /> <br />I twisted my fist, pounding in the impact.<br /> <br />Then― a shriek of pain escaped Atsuhara’s fist.<br /> <br />“Guhaa!?”<br /> <br />Along with intense pain. Cracks split his iron skin.<br /> <br />Bright red blood gushed out, and Atsuhara staggered back from the intense agony.<br /> <br />In his eyes, my image was reflected.<br /> <br />My whole body, covered in major burns. My fist’s skin was charred and crumbling, my lungs at their limit.<br /> <br />Blood flowed from one eye, halving my vision.<br /> <br />By all appearances, I was grievously injured― yet I had the advantage over Atsuhara.<br /> <br />“The fog was too fast for me to do anything. I never throw this punches in daily life. But… against a slow guy like you, I can fight, Atsuhara Nagashi.”<br /> <br />A flimsy excuse to the crowd. However, he’s in no state to listen anymore.<br /> <br />“Wh-what is… this! What the hell, what the hell are you!?”<br /> <br />Only fear remained in Atsuhara’s eyes.<br /> <br />Against his full power… yet a mere human had directly shattered his fist.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto still hadn’t used any abilities.<br /> <br />I realized his breathing had grown ragged, unable to conceal his agitation transmitting to me.<br /> <br />Sorry for scaring you, Atsuhara. Just accept this loss as bad luck this time.<br /> <br />I heaved a big sigh and raised both hands.<br /> <br />“I surrender. I’ve reached my limit.”<br /> <br />And so, I was defeated by Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My grievously wounded self was welcomed by Class C.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-kun… You’re so hurt―”<br /> <br />“S-so much for your overconfidence… Asahina who crumbled without even fighting isn’t me, right…?”<br /> <br />“Blegh!?”<br /> <br />Asahina coughed up blood from my words, her overkill effect dissipating.<br /> <br />She collapsed to her knees. Karasuma supported me from the side.<br /> <br />“…Geez, you haven’t changed one bit as usual. We’re quite shocked that you were stronger than we imagined.”<br /> <br />“I… never said I was weak?”<br /> <br />“Well, yeah, that’s true but…”<br /> <br />Karasuma gave a bitter laugh I couldn’t describe.<br /> <br />Leaning on Karasuma’s shoulder, I sat down next to the injured Sakuma.<br /> <br />Apparently our classmate Ishino had been treating Sakuma’s wounds. Ishino seemed conflicted over whether to prioritize me or Sakuma, but Sakuma sighed and pointed at me.<br /> <br />“Oi, Ishino. No matter how you look at it, this idiot is in critical condition. No, he’s at death’s door. Hurry up and heal him.”<br /> <br />“R-Right! Amamori-kun, are you okay…!?”<br /> <br />Good ol’ Sakuma, casually acting manly.<br /> <br />Sakuma’s own injuries were surely not minor.<br /> <br />Yet without any hesitation, he interrupted his own treatment. Few could readily make that decision… Though I suppose my injuries being so severe played a part.<br /> <br />“I’ll save you! Medical King!”<br /> <br />Ishino Makoto. His ability was Medical King, a gentle power that could heal any wound.<br /> <br />Green light shone from his hands, flowing into my body.<br /> <br />“It’s bad… His lungs are practically nonfunctional, and he’s covered in burns… Are you really okay, Amamori-kun? This is…”<br /> <br />“Ah, no problem at all.”<br /> <br />Well, to be precise, intense pain was constantly assaulting my entire body.<br /> <br />Haha, just kidding. I tried to play it tough but no can do. It hurts like hell, yo. Save me, Ishino. Never doing something so reckless again. Seriously, gimme a break.<br /> <br />As Ishino treated my injuries, a shadow suddenly fell over me.<br /> <br />Looking up, it was Kurotsuki, with a complicated expression.<br /> <br />“Amamori…kun.”<br /> <br />Seeing the shock in his eyes, I let out a deep sigh.<br /> <br />“Right now, there’s only one thing I can say to you.”<br /> <br />I whipped my body and stood up.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki looked down at me. Staring straight into his eyes, I clenched my fist.<br /> <br />And thrust it into his chest.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki Kanade. You’re a genius.<br /> <br />Sometimes, your talent may hurt people.<br /> <br />Sometimes, friends may be jealous of your talent.<br /> <br />But laugh it off and blow it away.<br /> <br />Talent is something more free and wonderful.<br /> <br />Live with more pride as Kurotsuki Kanade the genius.<br /> <br />Hone your skills, aim for the heights. Don’t stop there, keep walking.<br /> <br />If all your jealous rivals lose to you, it can’t be helped.<br /> <br />Refine yourself to perfection, until you can’t squeeze out any more.<br /> <br />After all, no matter how hard you work, you’ll never catch up to me.<br /> <br />I will continue to surpass you in every aspect.<br /> <br />So don’t hold anything back now.<br /> <br />Continue being the【Genius Kurotsuki Kanade】.<br /> <br />“You’re up next.”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />He looked down at the fist slammed into his chest, thinking who knows what.<br /> <br />As the flustered Ishino forcibly sat me down, Kurotsuki looked down at me and steeled his resolve.<br /> <br />“I see… I will take on this duty.”<br /> <br />I saw no more hesitation in his eyes.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Amamori Yuuto is a genius. I truly believe that from the bottom of my heart.<br /> <br />“Haah, haa… D-Damn it! Why, why me…! Scared of that worm…! Don’t mess with me! Why was I…!”<br /> <br />I stepped forward, in front of Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> <br />He had cornered Asahina-san and beaten down Sakuma-kun. That Atsuhara was no longer here.<br /> <br />He couldn’t even stabilize his ability. His massive body had reverted to its original size, his heat a far cry from earlier. He had no intimidating presence left whatsoever.<br /> <br />All that stood there was a frightened boy, shaken and afraid.<br /> <br />“Were you that scared of Amamori-kun?”<br /> <br />“Y-You…!”<br /> <br />When I called out to him, Atsuhara showed an excessive reaction.<br /> <br />No doubt he responded to hearing that name. He hid his shattered arm and looked up at me.<br /> <br />Well, I understand how you feel, Atsuhara.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto could be called a monster.<br /> <br />Despite his claims, in the very end, the fist he threw at Atsuhara…<br /> <br />Was the furthest thing from any “technique”.<br /> <br />No skills or tricks whatsoever. Just pure violence, lashing out with brute strength.<br /> <br />That fist directly blew apart the spiritual ability.<br /> <br />With no enhancements or powers used. He surpassed Atsuhara Nagashi in raw physical ability alone.<br /> <br />…It makes my skin crawl.<br /> <br />Even calling him a monster feels too tame. He’s beyond human, seriously.<br /> <br />Yet somehow, it loops back around to being funny that he’s so unhinged.<br /> <br />“This is a complete defeat.”</p>

<p>So first, sorry about this, Netsuhara Eien.<br /> <br />“I’ll have to make you taste humiliation.”<br /> <br />“Hah…?”<br /> <br />Netsuhara lets out an displeased voice.<br /> <br />“Let the match between Netsuhara Eien and Amamori Yuuto begin.”<br /> <br />The female student judge calls out.<br /> <br />Everyone is certain I’ll be instantly killed.<br /> <br />Even the judge student seems to be bracing herself to stop things immediately.<br /> <br />I hear Asahina-san screaming from afar.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I step right up to Netsuhara.<br /> <br />“…Huh?”<br /> <br />A surprised voice comes out.<br /> <br />Netsuhara stands still with a look of shock on his face.<br /> <br />–So I just casually punch his face.<br /> <br />“Gubuh!?”<br /> <br />Together with an ugly scream, Netsuhara’s body spins vertically several times.<br /> <br />His momentum carries him crashing into the ground.<br /> <br />No more screams can be heard from around.<br /> <br />Everyone has their eyes open wide, frozen, as they watch.<br /> <br />The only ones moving are me who punched him and Netsuhara who was punched.<br /> <br />“Wha-, what the, what is…”<br /> <br />Netsuhara mutters in confusion and frustration.<br /> <br />Like he had done earlier, I step on his head with my dirty shoe sole.<br /> <br />Netsuhara opens his eyes wide seemingly unable to comprehend but.<br /> <br />When I put strength into my trampling foot, anger surfaces in his eyes.<br /> <br />“I held back… Can’t you tell, Netsuhara? The force wasn’t real.”<br /> <br />I lower my voice so only he can hear.<br /> <br />I went easy on purpose. If I win, see, it’ll stand out right?<br /> <br />If things end here, it’ll look like you were just weak.<br /> <br />Come on, do your best. Strong Netsuhara.<br /> <br />There’s still work I need you to do.<br /> <br />“I’ll let you win properly so go on, stand up.”<br /> <br />I can see his body clearly trembling, loud teeth grinding can be heard.<br /> <br />“You…!”<br /> <br />He sweeps my foot away with strength and takes a few steps back to glare at me. Netsuhara somehow stands but his body sways, clearly still damaged.<br /> <br />Anger and frustration surpassing that.<br /> <br />Various emotions mixed together show in his eyes.<br /> <br />I briefly glance Kurotsuki’s way.<br /> <br />Won’t say much. See it.<br /> <br />I’ll show proof that a mundane person has surpassed you.<br /> <br />“Come at me seriously, Netsuhara.”<br /> <br />I’ll declare it.<br /> <br />Today, I’m destroying your concept of [Genius].<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“Don’t get cocky…! I ain’t done yet!”<br /> <br />A clear superior. Negligence and arrogance. A match undertaken leisurely with confidence from easily bringing down Class C’s top. All that was shattered in an instant.<br /> <br />Netsuhara must be furious, trying to hide his agitation.<br /> <br />“I’ll kill you!”<br /> <br />Netsuhara unleashes a sharp fist… He trained in martial arts or something? It’s an amazingly crisp fist unlike an ordinary person’s. No wonder Sakuma got done in.<br /> <br />But you think something like that will work on me?<br /> <br />“Gubuh–!?”<br /> <br />A one-shot counter at point blank range.<br /> <br />Blood spurts from Netsuhara’s face and he staggers back panting.<br /> <br />“You…!”<br /> <br />“Wha-, what is, happening–“<br /> <br />The flustered Netsuhara and Asahina-san who can’t comprehend the situation. I briefly glance Kurashiki’s way. She’s making a surprised expression but also sends eye contact my way.<br /> <br />‘Is this really okay, standing out this much?’<br /> <br />Well… No, it’s not good. But even so, in this situation, there’s no future where Class C wins unless I do this. It can’t be helped. Yeah, it can’t be helped.<br /> <br />Sending that feeling in response, I get ‘Liar’ through eye contact from Kurashiki.<br /> <br />I return ‘Back me up please’ with my eyes, and sensed her sighing.<br /> <br />“Maybe… Amamori-kun has really ‘good eyes’…or something.”<br /> <br />As Kurashiki utters those seemingly ‘reasonable’ words, attention gathers.<br /> <br />Now then, what kind of excuse will she give? I’m a little excited.<br /> <br />I can see Netsuhara is also focusing on Kurashiki. To gather information in front of the enemy… Has he started being wary of me to that extent? Well, doesn’t change the outcome so it’s fine.<br /> <br />“Just luck…is what I thought but maybe not. It could’ve been blessed good fortune from heaven! His true power being the divine eyes said to see all creation! Avoiding lethal blows from Kirido-san, dodging Kurotsuki-san’s attacks, it was not coincidence but inevitability! Something like that, yes!”<br /> <br />“U-Umm… Yeah! Probably!”<br /> <br />Tendou-san nearby picks up on Kurashiki’s explanation.<br /> <br />Receiving her explanation, the students focus on me.<br /> <br />So it’s gone from luck to kinetic vision huh. …It’s hard to adjust my position and stance as the character setting of [Amamori Yuuto] hasn’t quite solidified yet.<br /> <br />Also Kurashiki-san. You’ve been looking at me like ‘Are you sane?’ this whole time but please don’t worry about that.<br /> <br />Even after punching Netsuhara, in the end I won’t stand out.<br /> <br />I’m standing here after properly considering that much.<br /> <br />“I see… So you weren’t just a small fry.” Netsuhara’s unpleasant voice can be heard. “But! In this school, the strength of one’s power is paramount! No matter how excellent your ‘base,’ a small fry power like yours is lower than bugs to my [Blessing]!”<br /> <br />“A blessing… So it really was!”<br /> <br />I knew he was a blesssed ability user when he got Sakuma.<br /> <br />Netsuhara wipes the blood flowing from his nose and crosses both hands.<br /> <br />Sparks burst from around him as he does and he grins convinced of victory–<br /> <br />“I’ll praise you! You couldn’t make me use my pow-Guheh!?”<br /> <br />A dropkick to the face.<br /> <br />As he’s blown away, he holds his face in a squat and I look down at him expressionlessly.<br /> <br />“Don’t talk, just use your power.”<br /> <br />It’s not just him, but many first years still can’t use their powers properly.<br /> <br />Even if it looks invincible, there is always a standby time from ‘deciding to use the power’ to ‘the power manifesting.’ So aim for that opening.<br /> <br />Even if the ability specializes in speed, there are countless ways to deal with it.<br /> <br />…Huh, Kirido? Don’t say foolish things.<br /> <br />“Wai-, he was…that strong?”<br /> <br />I hear Karasuma’s amazed-sounding voice.<br /> <br />Were we able to clear away some of the despair, I wonder? The atmosphere felt a bit stifling so I think it’s about time we changed the air.<br /> <br />“Th-This…! I’ll kill you…!”<br /> <br />Netsuhara closes in on me with his anger on full display.<br /> <br />I promptly evade and seize one of his arms, twisting it to his back and stomping that back.<br /> <br />Commonly called ‘hyperextending the joint.’<br /> <br />“Don’t move. I’ll break your bone if you do.”<br /> <br />“…Kh, y-you…!”<br /> <br />Just as he’s squeaking, I crush the bones in his wrist.<br /> <br />Netsuhara’s entire body is drenched in cold sweat as he strongly bites his lip.<br /> <br />Looks like he didn’t scream. Admirable for a student.<br /> <br />He looks back at me over his shoulder…and fear dwells in those eyes.<br /> <br />“–Don’t worry. I’m serious.”<br /> <br />Say I’ll break it, and I’ll break it. Say I’ll kill, and I’ll certainly kill.<br /> <br />You’re my enemy right? Then there’s no hesitation or doubt.<br /> <br />From what he read in my eyes, he grinds his teeth forcefully.<br /> <br />And–I noticed something was off shortly after.<br /> <br />“…? This is–“<br /> <br />I release his arm and take great distance.<br /> <br />The roused students tilt their heads at my actions…and the next moment, open their eyes wide seeing Netsuhara stand up… Because the ground around him had gone muddy.<br /> <br />“…Tch, finally used it huh…”<br /> <br />“S-Sakuma! You okay!?”<br /> <br />Looking back, it seems Sakuma who had lost consciousness woke up.<br /> <br />“My power…was completely ineffective. In other words, his ability perfectly nullifies heat. Or…it has to be a heat power surpassing mine aside from that.”<br /> <br />The ground melts with Netsuhara at the center.<br /> <br />The heat singes my skin. My eyeballs tingle and dry up, inhaling makes my lungs scream. This is too much, so I cover my mouth with my clothes. Well, that’s like sprinkling water on hot stones though.<br /> <br />“You…made me mad. Amamori…was it? Your face is so small fry I can’t remember your damn name!”<br /> <br />“Netsuhara, excessive provocation just makes you look stupid.”<br /> <br />Or could it be you’re just bad at remembering names?<br /> <br />No, you have to properly remember other people’s names. It’s rude not to.<br /> <br />I was about to continue when in the next moment, I reflexively thrust out my right hand.<br /> <br />An ‘iron lump’ flies toward my palm at tremendous speed. I unconsciously tried to catch it but… I hear flesh burning and pain runs through me, so I quickly let go of the iron lump.<br /> <br />“This is…”<br /> <br />Looking at my palm, a large burn scar remains.<br /> <br />Steam gushes up intensely from the iron lump rolled at my feet, blocking vision.<br /> <br />Huh, isn’t this pretty dangerous? My sense of danger passes through my head and disappears.<br /> <br />Looking ahead, Netsuhara’s body has changed to a dull red color.<br /> <br />His skin is steel, the air around him is flames itself.<br /> <br />For me who can only punch and kick, that figure is like a nightmare.<br /> <br />Rarely see compound abilities but… I see. His power isn’t just heat, it seems. Even Kurotsuki would have a hard time with this.<br /> <br />“I’ll kill you–[Molten Iron Blessing]!”<br /> <br />From him as the center, tremendous pressure spills out.<br /> <br />The air quivers from the heat.<br /> <br />The heat blasts out as shockwaves, blowing back my bangs.<br /> <br />“Is this…something I should touch?”<br /> <br />“Go ahead and try, shitty insect!”<br /> <br />Netsuhara yells and charges out at the same time.<br /> <br />Compared to before…his movements are unchanged. No, they actually feel slower to me.<br /> <br />His whole body turned to iron. Of course his movements would dull. But this is–<br /> <br />(Ah, almost…!)</p>

<p>Due to the intense heat, I evade the attack and take distance.<br /> <br />The heat immediately moves away and I deeply inhale.<br /> <br />“My power…is the ultimate spear and shield. Flames that destroy all, flames that burn everything! Iron skin that withstands all, boasting invulnerability! With molten iron, I’m unrivaled! That’s me! Netsuhara Eien!”<br /> <br />Disregarding the blood flowing from his nose, he charges at me.<br /> <br />With that much heat, even I can’t endure it for long.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-kun! That’s too dangerous! Please… surrender…!”<br /> <br />“Amamori! Don’t worry about what happens later! We’re the ones left! you did well …… without even using your powers! leave the rest to us, just surrender!”<br /> <br />Asahina-san and Karasuma’s voices rang out.<br /> <br />Voices flew from other students I had never spoken to before.<br /> <br />This seems to be my limit, the utmost I can do right now… Or so it must look.<br /> <br />When I turned my gaze to Kurotsuki, he was shaking his head from side to side.<br /> <br />It’s enough, stop already. You absolutely can’t beat Atsuhara as you are now.<br /> <br />Those feelings were transparently visible… Yet I didn’t run away.<br /> <br />“…You still won’t acknowledge it?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Are we done with this game of tag?”<br /> <br />Seeing me stop running away, Atsuhara’s smile deepened.<br /> <br />In response, I relaxed my shoulders and took a deep breath.<br /> <br />Hey, Kurotsuki. If you were in this situation, could you beat Atsuhara barehanded?<br /> <br />If your answer is “I could”, then I’ll give up. If you can beat a monster like him barehanded, you must be a genius beyond my capabilities.<br /> <br />But if you think you can’t,<br /> <br />Then know this – we have no chance of winning. Burn that into your eyes.<br /> <br />I raised my fists. Atsuhara reacted slightly, then slowly closed the distance between us.<br /> <br />“I’ll torture ‘n slaughter ya real slow. Any last words? Nah, don’t beg for your life or nothin’.”<br /> <br />“Well… What if I said I had martial arts training?”<br /> <br />An obvious lie.<br /> <br />Atsuhara raised an eyebrow, but didn’t show any major reaction.<br /> <br />Clenching his fist, he looked down on me with irritation and anger.<br /> <br />“…Tch, you still think you can win? I take back what I said earlier. More than Asahina or that worm from before… Amamori, you’re the one I hate the most. Enough. I’ll go all out― and fucking kill you!”<br /> <br />His dull iron body swelled to even greater proportions.<br /> <br />Atsuhara, who had been about the same height as me, was now easily over 2 meters.<br /> <br />A towering body I had to look up to see, muscles of iron that looked ready to burst. Overwhelming weight.<br /> <br />No matter how you looked at it, he was the picture of bloodthirsty killing intent.<br /> <br />“Amamori-kun…!”<br /> <br />“During an ongoing conflict, Class C students are forbidden from interfering. If you intend to break the rules, it will result in Class C’s unconditional defeat.”<br /> <br />The female student referee turned her gaze to me. Her eyes met mine; she hadn’t broken a sweat.<br /> <br />“Amamori Yuuto… I advise you surrender. You will die.”<br /> <br />“Thank you for the warning.”<br /> <br />With that said, I returned my eyes to Atsuhara.<br /> <br />Killing intent filled his eyes. He raised an enormous fist, swollen to nearly 1 meter in size.<br /> <br />Searing heat charred my skin and scorched my lungs. My eyeballs were at their limit.<br /> <br />The visual pressure, on top of it all, forced me to squeeze my eyes shut.<br /> <br />“Die, Brave Iron Fist!”<br /> <br />An enormous mass of heat came crashing down.<br /> <br />A direct hit would mean instant death. I was certain of the power assaulting me.<br /> <br />Even with eyes closed, I knew death was imminent.<br /> <br />Did Atsuhara think he had secured victory?<br /> <br />Would Asahina-san try to intervene?<br /> <br />Could Kurotsuki see this scene?<br /> <br />What an― absolutely perfect chance. This is the best, Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> <br />I believed if I pushed you into a corner, you would react like this.<br /> <br />I clench my fist and open my eyes.<br /> <br />I too threw a straight right punch to meet the enormous fist plunging towards me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In that moment, the impact reverberated through me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A dull sound, like colliding solid objects.<br /> <br />The giant fist and my thin arm’s small fist.<br /> <br />Yet somehow, the two were deadlocked.<br /> <br />“Wha―”<br /> <br />Atsuhara’s shock rippled outwards.<br /> <br />But well, it’s a bit too soon to be surprised.<br /> <br />I twisted my fist, pounding in the impact.<br /> <br />Then― a shriek of pain escaped Atsuhara’s fist.<br /> <br />“Guhaa!?”<br /> <br />Along with intense pain. Cracks split his iron skin.<br /> <br />Bright red blood gushed out, and Atsuhara staggered back from the intense agony.<br /> <br />In his eyes, my image was reflected.<br /> <br />My whole body, covered in major burns. My fist’s skin was charred and crumbling, my lungs at their limit.<br /> <br />Blood flowed from one eye, halving my vision.<br /> <br />By all appearances, I was grievously injured― yet I had the advantage over Atsuhara.<br /> <br />“The fog was too fast for me to do anything. I never throw this punches in daily life. But… against a slow guy like you, I can fight, Atsuhara Nagashi.”<br /> <br />A flimsy excuse to the crowd. However, he’s in no state to listen anymore.<br /> <br />“Wh-what is… this! What the hell, what the hell are you!?”<br /> <br />Only fear remained in Atsuhara’s eyes.<br /> <br />Against his full power… yet a mere human had directly shattered his fist.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto still hadn’t used any abilities.<br /> <br />I realized his breathing had grown ragged, unable to conceal his agitation transmitting to me.<br /> <br />Sorry for scaring you, Atsuhara. Just accept this loss as bad luck this time.<br /> <br />I heaved a big sigh and raised both hands.<br /> <br />“I surrender. I’ve reached my limit.”<br /> <br />And so, I was defeated by Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My grievously wounded self was welcomed by Class C.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-kun… You’re so hurt―”<br /> <br />“S-so much for your overconfidence… Asahina who crumbled without even fighting isn’t me, right…?”<br /> <br />“Blegh!?”<br /> <br />Asahina coughed up blood from my words, her overkill effect dissipating.<br /> <br />She collapsed to her knees. Karasuma supported me from the side.<br /> <br />“…Geez, you haven’t changed one bit as usual. We’re quite shocked that you were stronger than we imagined.”<br /> <br />“I… never said I was weak?”<br /> <br />“Well, yeah, that’s true but…”<br /> <br />Karasuma gave a bitter laugh I couldn’t describe.<br /> <br />Leaning on Karasuma’s shoulder, I sat down next to the injured Sakuma.<br /> <br />Apparently our classmate Ishino had been treating Sakuma’s wounds. Ishino seemed conflicted over whether to prioritize me or Sakuma, but Sakuma sighed and pointed at me.<br /> <br />“Oi, Ishino. No matter how you look at it, this idiot is in critical condition. No, he’s at death’s door. Hurry up and heal him.”<br /> <br />“R-Right! Amamori-kun, are you okay…!?”<br /> <br />Good ol’ Sakuma, casually acting manly.<br /> <br />Sakuma’s own injuries were surely not minor.<br /> <br />Yet without any hesitation, he interrupted his own treatment. Few could readily make that decision… Though I suppose my injuries being so severe played a part.<br /> <br />“I’ll save you! Medical King!”<br /> <br />Ishino Makoto. His ability was Medical King, a gentle power that could heal any wound.<br /> <br />Green light shone from his hands, flowing into my body.<br /> <br />“It’s bad… His lungs are practically nonfunctional, and he’s covered in burns… Are you really okay, Amamori-kun? This is…”<br /> <br />“Ah, no problem at all.”<br /> <br />Well, to be precise, intense pain was constantly assaulting my entire body.<br /> <br />Haha, just kidding. I tried to play it tough but no can do. It hurts like hell, yo. Save me, Ishino. Never doing something so reckless again. Seriously, gimme a break.<br /> <br />As Ishino treated my injuries, a shadow suddenly fell over me.<br /> <br />Looking up, it was Kurotsuki, with a complicated expression.<br /> <br />“Amamori…kun.”<br /> <br />Seeing the shock in his eyes, I let out a deep sigh.<br /> <br />“Right now, there’s only one thing I can say to you.”<br /> <br />I whipped my body and stood up.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki looked down at me. Staring straight into his eyes, I clenched my fist.<br /> <br />And thrust it into his chest.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki Kanade. You’re a genius.<br /> <br />Sometimes, your talent may hurt people.<br /> <br />Sometimes, friends may be jealous of your talent.<br /> <br />But laugh it off and blow it away.<br /> <br />Talent is something more free and wonderful.<br /> <br />Live with more pride as Kurotsuki Kanade the genius.<br /> <br />Hone your skills, aim for the heights. Don’t stop there, keep walking.<br /> <br />If all your jealous rivals lose to you, it can’t be helped.<br /> <br />Refine yourself to perfection, until you can’t squeeze out any more.<br /> <br />After all, no matter how hard you work, you’ll never catch up to me.<br /> <br />I will continue to surpass you in every aspect.<br /> <br />So don’t hold anything back now.<br /> <br />Continue being the【Genius Kurotsuki Kanade】.<br /> <br />“You’re up next.”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />He looked down at the fist slammed into his chest, thinking who knows what.<br /> <br />As the flustered Ishino forcibly sat me down, Kurotsuki looked down at me and steeled his resolve.<br /> <br />“I see… I will take on this duty.”<br /> <br />I saw no more hesitation in his eyes.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Amamori Yuuto is a genius. I truly believe that from the bottom of my heart.<br /> <br />“Haah, haa… D-Damn it! Why, why me…! Scared of that worm…! Don’t mess with me! Why was I…!”<br /> <br />I stepped forward, in front of Atsuhara Nagashi.<br /> <br />He had cornered Asahina-san and beaten down Sakuma-kun. That Atsuhara was no longer here.<br /> <br />He couldn’t even stabilize his ability. His massive body had reverted to its original size, his heat a far cry from earlier. He had no intimidating presence left whatsoever.<br /> <br />All that stood there was a frightened boy, shaken and afraid.<br /> <br />“Were you that scared of Amamori-kun?”<br /> <br />“Y-You…!”<br /> <br />When I called out to him, Atsuhara showed an excessive reaction.<br /> <br />No doubt he responded to hearing that name. He hid his shattered arm and looked up at me.<br /> <br />Well, I understand how you feel, Atsuhara.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto could be called a monster.<br /> <br />Despite his claims, in the very end, the fist he threw at Atsuhara…<br /> <br />Was the furthest thing from any “technique”.<br /> <br />No skills or tricks whatsoever. Just pure violence, lashing out with brute strength.<br /> <br />That fist directly blew apart the spiritual ability.<br /> <br />With no enhancements or powers used. He surpassed Atsuhara Nagashi in raw physical ability alone.<br /> <br />…It makes my skin crawl.<br /> <br />Even calling him a monster feels too tame. He’s beyond human, seriously.<br /> <br />Yet somehow, it loops back around to being funny that he’s so unhinged.<br /> <br />“This is a complete defeat.”</p>

<p>I’m ashamed I ever thought I was the “most excellent in the world”.<br /> <br />Someone far greater than me was right nearby this whole time.<br /> <br />A person who could casually accomplish what I couldn’t was right before my eyes.<br /> <br />Then what’s left to hesitate about?<br /> <br />“I can… go meet Itsuki and Kanae with a smile now.”<br /> <br />When I meet them, I’ll apologize. And talk to them cheerfully.<br /> <br />About my spectacular loss… and the man named Amamori Yuuto I respected.<br /> <br />“Sh-shut up! Shut up, shut up! Everyone be quiet and rot! You’re all licking me…! I’ll slam every last one of you into hell with my bare hands!”<br /> <br />Atsuhara Nagashi shouted, unleashing his power.<br /> <br />As heat surged forth once more, I too activated my ability.<br /> <br />“Unleash― Demon Lord’s Blessing.”<br /> <br />Atsuhara Nagashi. He’s strong. I believe that for sure after our fights.<br /> <br />But still, having witnessed his power directly…<br /> <br />“Sorry in advance, Atsuhara.”<br /> <br />“Hah!?”<br /> <br />I slammed the truth towards his irritated, shouting self.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“You see… I’m the world’s second greatest genius.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Demon Lord’s Blessing… huh.”<br /> <br />The supernatural abilities granted to the students. Among them, Asahina’s “Thunder God’s Blessing” and the like carried divine names and reigned supreme among the blessings.<br /> <br />And surely, his power was second only to that.<br /> <br />“Freeze.”<br /> <br />With that single word from Kurotsuki, in the next moment, all the blazing flames froze over.<br /> <br />The searing heat became bitter cold. Looking to Atsuhara, his dull body was encased entirely in ice. Atsuhara’s ice statue was completed in an instant.<br /> <br />“Whoa… There’s someone crazier than Amamori.”<br /> <br />Sakuma muttered in awe next to me.<br /> <br />I was also quite shocked, but Kurotsuki had gone even further.<br /> <br />After all, he completely sealed Atsuhara’s Heat with a single word.<br /> <br />On top of that, he was tall and hot. Super photogenic and cool, making my exploits look like an opening act in comparison. Well, that was the intent after all.<br /> <br />But Atsuhara wouldn’t fall to this either.<br /> <br />“Damn you…!”<br /> <br />The ice cracked sharply.<br /> <br />In the next moment, the ice exploded from the heat waves, and unharmed Atsuhara reappeared.<br /> <br />“How the hell… did you beat that cheater…?”<br /> <br />“Just luck, perhaps?”<br /> <br />Completely ignoring Sakuma’s question, he watched for Kurotsuki’s reaction.<br /> <br />…It doesn’t seem he’s surprised. Watching from here, it kinda looks like he’s confirming and grasping the extent of his own power and the force he can exert.<br /> <br />Wondering why, one possibility immediately came to mind.<br /> <br />“Could it be…”<br /> <br />“Kurotsuki-kun… has never gone all out before…?”<br /> <br />Somehow, Kurashiki who had approached unnoticed was violently twitching her cheek.<br /> <br />At her words, everyone in Class C reacted with surprise, while the problematic Kurotsuki emotionlessly focused on Atsuhara.<br /> <br />“Next, freeze concentrated in one spot.”<br /> <br />Once more, the cold air erupted. The ridiculous heat was frozen solid in an instant.<br /> <br />The power… was clearly stronger than before.<br /> <br />If I took that, I’d die instantly for sure, yeah?<br /> <br />As cold sweat ran down my cheek, Atsuhara once again swooped back from the ice.<br /> <br />“…Damn it! You… have no intention of fighting—”<br /> <br />“Once more.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki waved his hand, and an even greater surge of cold spilled out, freezing Netsuhara.<br /> <br />…At this point, I also understood what Kurotsuki was trying to do.<br /> <br />Netsuhara would pierce the ice with heat, and Kurotsuki would chill that heat with ice… It continued endlessly.<br /> <br />However, there was a change. Kurotsuki’s power was growing stronger each time he used it.<br /> <br />Faster, stronger, and most importantly, more skillful. It was growing at an incredible speed.<br /> <br />“Cut it out already! Everyone here is getting on my nerves…! And you, are you trying to have a showdown of abilities with me, too? Huh!?”<br /> <br />“…No, that’s enough. I’ve completed what I needed to do.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki did not use ice again…<br /> <br />The surrounding students tilted their heads in puzzlement, but a few seemed to have realized something.<br /> <br />Netsuhara’s battle was flashy and on a large scale, so many were focused only on his “heat powers.” However, Netsuhara’s Psychic Ability was fundamentally [Iron Heat].<br /> <br />If his heat was too strong, you just had to target the weakness of iron.<br /> <br />Snap – a sound rang out from Netsuhara’s arm as he looked down at his right arm in shock.<br /> <br />I had definitely shattered his right arm with my fist.<br /> <br />However, it was only to a “certain” extent. The injury wasn’t enough to completely disable it.<br /> <br />But it should provide an opening he could exploit.<br /> <br />“No…no way…you!”<br /> <br />“After all, it’s just a fraction of the power from the Blessings. Simply cooling and heating may not have had much effect. But Amamori-kun showed the way. He created an opening. Damage like that should allow me to trigger complete destruction.”<br /> <br />The wound I inflicted was, in other words, a ‘weak point.’<br /> <br />By rapidly alternating extreme cold and heat focused on that area, even metal will weaken and become brittle.<br /> <br />Collapse would begin centered around the wound I dealt.<br /> <br />“Th…this kind of…this can’t be! Don’t screw with me! I’m Netsuhara! A genius who brought Class A to heel in a day! I’m at the top! I’m king! I’m going to rule this academy…that’s why you guys are just my pawns! Stepping stones! But…why…why me…!”<br /> <br />“Genius? Do you understand what that word means when you use it?”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki formed a gigantic “black bullet” in his right hand.<br /> <br />…It was one or two sizes larger than what he used against me.<br /> <br />Netsuhara’s face twisted violently. At the same time, the collapse of his arm began.<br /> <br />That collapse would not stop anymore.<br /> <br />“Sh…shit! Why…why, why…!”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki spared a single glance at the screaming Netsuhara before mercilessly pounding in a decisive strike.<br /> <br />“The word ‘genius’ is what we use to refer to people like us.”<br /> <br />The black bullet struck Netsuhara Nagashi directly.<br /> <br />There was no scream.<br /> <br />Netsuhara, his consciousness reaped in an instant, collapsed with eyes rolled back.<br /> <br />And Kurotsuki looked down at him dispassionately.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Also, you should research the word ‘king’ a little more.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />His figure could be described as nothing short of [The Devil King].<br /> </p>

<p>And so.<br /> <br />The first conflict duel request battle this term between Class A and Class C came to an end.<br /> <br />Looking back, it finished abruptly.<br /> <br />The moment Netsuhara Nagashi was defeated, the remaining Class A members forfeited, granting victory to Class C.<br /> <br />As a result, Netsuhara was restricted from harming others, and Asahina’s justice prevailed.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />――This is the aftermath.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“As expected, we lost after all.”<br /> <br />The girl muttered happily.<br /> <br />The location was inside Class 1-A’s classroom.<br /> <br />No matter who looked at that scene, it was “abnormal.”<br /> <br />“So with this formula…”<br /> <br />“I’m king, I’m the strongest, no way no way no way…”<br /> <br />The homeroom teacher wrote on the blackboard with chalk.<br /> <br />Netsuhara Nagashi was muttering nonsense.<br /> <br />…Their eyes were empty.<br /> <br />No visible emotion, not a glimpse of sanity either.<br /> <br />“As expected? You knew we would lose?”<br /> <br />The red-haired girl, Akaba, spoke up.<br /> <br />She had been one of the entries in the conflict request battle.<br /> <br />Though she ultimately didn’t get to fight, if Amamori had been there, he would have been very wary of Akaba.<br /> <br />Such was the aura and pressure emanating from this girl.<br /> <br />“Now Akaba, that’s rude.”<br /> <br />“Hah? Then please explain, did you anticipate Class A losing?”<br /> <br />“No? ……, but the results show that it was probably a losing battle to begin with.”<br /> <br />The one who answered Akaba was Maishin Karen, another entry in the battle.<br /> <br />Looking at the girl who first spoke, she began explaining.<br /> <br />“At the very least, I fully expected this outcome. That’s why I directed the conditions of losing the battle to target ‘Netsuhara Nagashi’ specifically.”<br /> <br />The dangerous one in Class A was Netsuhara Nagashi alone.<br /> <br />That’s why Asahina said “What I ask of you is” when setting the rules.<br /> <br />Thinking similarly, Kurashiki and the others present didn’t interfere either.<br /> <br />Without even realizing their thoughts were guided by Psychic Abilities.<br /> <br />“This allows us to challenge Class C again.”<br /> <br />Also present were others like “Robert Beckio” and “Yoneda Hanbei,” students who forfeited during the battle.<br /> <br />“But man, that guy, Kurotsuki I think? He’s way too crazy. I mean, completely sealing Netsuhara like that… Class C is just insane.”<br /> <br />“It’s not just him. I think Asahina Kasumi is also pretty tough for a stubborn idiot.”<br /> <br />Following Akaba, Yoneda evaluated Class C.<br /> <br />Among Class C, two particularly stood out with powerful Psychic Abilities – Asahina Kasumi and Kurotsuki Kanade.<br /> <br />There were probably other students with strong abilities too. Sakuma Junya, whom we fought, was a good example.<br /> <br />However…after seeing that battle, I understood. We could beat that level normally.<br /> <br />And if Sakuma Junya was the strongest, we could gauge the others’ levels too.<br /> <br />That’s why those two were the ones to watch out for in their class.<br /> <br />Until the girl mentioned one more person.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“But the strongest is him – Amamori Yuuto.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At those words, Class A fell silent.<br /> <br />Except for the homeroom teacher continuing her lesson and Netsuhara muttering nonsense.<br /> <br />Everyone else present froze in shock.<br /> <br />“Huh, what? Where did you hear that?”<br /> <br />“No, no, you showing respect for another…what kind of joke is this?”<br /> <br />In Class A gathered with prodigies from all walks of life.<br /> <br />Everyone acknowledged that they couldn’t beat her.<br /> <br />Acknowledged by all as an unparalleled genius, a once-in-a-millennium talent. That was this girl.<br /> <br />It was unthinkable that the strongest her would show “respect” to another, even jokingly.<br /> <br />“Without him, Kurotsuki Kanade would have forfeited. Then perhaps even Amamori-sama would have shown his skill. I proposed the battle anticipating that, but to think he would motivate Kurotsuki Kanade…”<br /> <br />“Um, ojou-sama…did you, know that man?”<br /> <br />“Yes, I know him very well.”<br /> <br />The girl knew Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />No – the girl had entered this academy chasing after Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />The girl turned her gaze out the window.<br /> <br />Her profile was flushed red.<br /> <br />Like a maiden pining for her crush.<br /> <br />Like a devil finding a cherished toy.<br /> <br />Everyone present shuddered and feared that expression.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />She had dominated Class A within a single hour.<br /> <br />Discerning Netsuhara Nagashi’s power, she brainwashed him to make him her pawn. A puppet.<br /> <br />She turned her attention to other classes and analyzed every potential threat.<br /> <br />Class 1-B, Shinzaki Yasuhito.<br /> <br />Class 1-C, Asahina Kasumi, Kurashiki Hotaru, Kurotsuki Kanade, and Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />“As long as we watch out for Shinzaki-kun, we can leave Class B be. But you’re different. You’re a monster I acknowledge.”<br /> <br />…It would make responding easier if he came out into the open.<br /> <br />But he probably won’t appear publicly.<br /> <br />To move freely.<br /> <br />Yes, he’d likely position someone like Kurotsuki Kanade as a puppet.<br /> <br />Imagining that far ahead, the girl laughed.<br /> <br />“There’s so much I want to discuss.”<br /> <br />She swayed her white hair in the wind and narrowed her red eyes in delight.<br /> <br />In an instant, the wounds she took from Netsuhara disappeared.<br /> <br />Vanishing without a trace, like an illusion.<br /> <br />No – there were no wounds to begin with.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Amamori-sama…ahh, I want to fight you soon.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />――The girl’s name was Tachibana Tsukihime.<br /> <br />A once-in-a-millennium genius.<br /> </p>
