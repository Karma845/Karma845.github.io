<h1>Chapter 4: Spending Time at My Sister Online Wife’s Place</h1>


<p>With all the end-of-term exams over and done with, as soon as homeroom ended, I headed home. Right now, I was borrowing a tablet from Kotomi and watching the overseas drama recommended by Takase.</p>



<p>It was a popular series with six seasons, totaling seventy-two episodes. Unlike our otaku activities, there was no time limit, but I wanted to watch at least one season a day so I could discuss it with Takase afterward.</p>



<p>“Haru-nii! Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>The rhythmic knock came just as the third episode was starting. I paused the video and called out, “You can come in.”</p>



<p>Kotomi burst into the room energetically. Her face was unusually bright.</p>



<p>“Is this about otaku activities?” I asked.</p>



<p>Kotomi happily shook her head, “Momoi-san invited me to hang out!”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s great. Are you going together?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s me, Takase-san, Kotobuki-san, and Aoki-san!”</p>



<p>“Takase too, huh…”</p>



<p><em>Man, I’m jealous.</em></p>



<p>I wish they’d invite me too… But that’s probably not happening. I hadn’t received any messages from Momoi, and although I was invited to the birthday party, that was probably just because I was involved with Kotomi’s gift. It would probably be more fun for the girls to hang out without me if it wasn’t about otaku activities.</p>



<p>“Wherever you’re going, have fun.”</p>



<p>“I want to, but I need Haru-nii’s help for that…”</p>



<p>“Me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah…” Kotomi lowered her gaze and continued in a softer tone, “I was asked in the online game earlier to ‘<em>help prevent me being hit on at the beach,’ </em>so… is that okay?”</p>



<p>“Of course!”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“There’s no reason why not!”</p>



<p>I got to go to the beach with Takase! I could see her in swimsuits! I was so happy I felt like jumping for joy!</p>



<p>“Oh, right. Haru-nii, you love the sea, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“Even if I have to prevent Momoi from getting hit on, the sea is still the sea, right? I’m super excited! But what about you, Kotomi? Are you okay with it?”</p>



<p>Kotomi was a total indoor person. Not only did she dislike the heat, crowds, exposing her skin, the smell of the beach, or getting sand on her feet, but she also hated the sticky feeling from seawater on her skin.</p>



<p>She used to go to the beach with the family, but after being stung by a jellyfish, she had declared that she would never go to the sea again during her fourth grade.</p>



<p>“I’ll have friends with me! I’m confident I’ll have fun!”</p>



<p>My little sister, who used to shy away from the outdoor activities, now eagerly anticipated beach outings. Not just that, she was also excited to go to school lately.</p>



<p>While it wasn’t exactly “seeing someone with fresh perspective after three days,” having made four friends in just over a month had really brightened Kotomi up.</p>



<p>And it was thanks to Momoi becoming her friend.</p>



<p>If preventing Momoi getting hit on meant Kotomi could have fun, then I was okay with going to the beach even without Takase.</p>



<p>“By the way, when are you guys going?”</p>



<p>“On the 17th of this month.”</p>



<p>“Going just before summer vacation, huh? Let’s see, the 17th is… a Monday. Oh, but it’s Marine Day.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, a holiday… Haru-nii, do you have plans?”</p>



<p>Would the beach plan fall apart if I wasn’t there? I smiled reassuringly at Kotomi, whose eyes flickered with anxiety.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. Even if I had plans, I’d cancel them. But I don’t have any plans to begin with.”</p>



<p>“Yes! Thanks, Haru-nii! Then tell Momoi-san we’re going over the phone!”</p>



<p>Perhaps having learned from last time’s mistake, this time, I was supposed to make the contact. I dialed Momoi’s number right away and she answered on the first ring.</p>



<p><em>“Hello, Haruto-kun? What about the beach?”</em></p>



<p>“We’re in!”</p>



<p><em>“Great, I was counting on you. With you around, no one will dare to hit on me, right?”</em></p>



<p>“I’ll keep an eye out to make sure no guys bother you, so relax and enjoy yourself!”</p>



<p><em>“Thank you. You’ll play with us too, won’t you?”</em></p>



<p>“Can I join in too?”</p>



<p>We had spent a decent amount of time together over the past two months. I knew she didn’t have any qualms about hanging out with me now, but going to the beach means we’d both be in swimsuits. It could be awkward to be so close to each other. </p>



<p>I had been picturing myself waiting under the parasol, ready to dash over to Momoi and the others if any guys approached.</p>



<p><em>“Of course you’re joining with us. Besides, if we don’t play together, guys will pick me up because they think we’re in different groups.”</em></p>



<p>I could just run over and call out to them, but Momoi was ridiculously popular. The guys at school know she wasn’t interested in them, so they didn’t even bother talking to her. But guys at the beach were a different story. If they saw an opportunity, they’d swarm around her like bees and I’d end up running back and forth between Momoi and the parasol.</p>



<p>But most importantly, I was glad I get to have fun with Takase!</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll make sure to have a blast. Where should we meet?”</p>



<p><em>“We’ll meet at Koigishi Station at 9:30. And we’re going to Aigahama.”</em></p>



<p>“Why there? Wouldn’t Yumishiro Beach be closer?”</p>



<p><em>“We went to Yumishiro last year, but this year… you and Kotomi-san are coming.”</em></p>



<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>



<p><em>“Don’t you get it? Aigahama is like a sacred place, it’s where ‘Miki-chan Wants to Swim’ is set.”</em></p>



<p>W-What’s that?! Was that an anime? Manga? Game? Wait, we’re doing otaku stuff at the beach too? Could I cover all of that before the 17th!?</p>



<p><em>“Why are you so quiet?”</em></p>



<p>“N-no, it’s just, I was holding back a sneeze! Of course I knew that! I just thought we wouldn’t go to the sacred place this time since Takase and the others are coming!”</p>



<p><em>“That’s right! Because they accepted my otaku hobby, we can all go to Aigahama together! I’m so excited! Hey, doesn’t Miki-chan have a beach house there?”</em></p>



<p>“Oh, yeah, she does! Miki-chan’s beach house!”</p>



<p>“Huh? Miki-chan!?”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s eyes lit up.</p>



<p>Oh, right, Kotomi’s here! I’d switch to speaker mode and let her handle this!</p>



<p><em>“Is Kotomi there?”</em></p>



<p>“Yeah, she just came into the room.”</p>



<p><em>“Could you put her on speaker?”</em></p>



<p>“Sure thing,” I said, switching to speaker mode.</p>



<p><em>“Can you hear me, Kotomi-san?”</em></p>



<p>“Loud and clear! Hey, if you were talking about Miki-chan, does that mean we’re going to Aigahama!?”</p>



<p><em>“You bet! It’s a pilgrimage to the sacred site! Kotomi-san, you’re coming too, right?”</em></p>



<p>“Of course I am! I’ve been wanting to go ever since I watched the anime!”</p>



<p><em>“Me too! I want to visit all the places Miki-chan went, but the top priority is definitely her family’s beach house!”</em></p>



<p>“I wanna go, I wanna go! It’s called ‘Ariel’, isn’t it? The manager is the person who was the model for Miki-chan’s dad!”</p>



<p><em>“That’s right! They’ve got all sorts of anime-related stuff there, like voice actor autographs and illustrations by the animation director, among other things!”</em></p>



<p>“I’ve seen pictures online! They even have a life-size panel of Miki-chan! I definitely want to take some photos there!”</p>



<p><em>“Yeah! Let’s have Aoi-chan take them for us!”</em></p>



<p>“Sure! Aoki-san’s great at taking photos!”</p>



<p>They were getting too excited. If they were like this over the phone, I could only imagine how hyped they’d be when they actually went to the sacred site.</p>



<p>Since there was an animation director involved, <em>“Miki-chan Wants to Swim”</em> must be an anime. If I wanted to keep up with their discussions on the day, I needed to watch it beforehand. </p>



<p>I didn’t know how many cours it had, but I was a guy who had binge-watched a two-cour anime in one night. Five days should be more than enough. Sacrificing my binge-watching of foreign dramas was a small price to pay for a beach day with Takase.</p>



<p>After some lively anime talk, Momoi suddenly asked, <em>“Do you both have swimsuits?”</em></p>



<p>“I do, but Kotomi only has a school swimsuit, right?”</p>



<p>“Is a school swimsuit not okay?”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, but since you’re in your second year now, wouldn’t a bikini be better?”</p>



<p>“But in swimsuit episodes, there are characters in school swimsuits.”</p>



<p>Kotomi looked puzzled. Her only exposure to the beach was through anime, so she had some odd misconceptions.</p>



<p>“Um, is it because I’m not a loli character that a school swimsuit won’t do?”</p>



<p>“That’s not it. I mean, high school girls don’t usually wear them to the beach. You’d stand out.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t criticizing school swimsuits or anything. It was just that Momoi would be with us this time. She already stood out, and she’d definitely attract more attention when wearing a bikini.</p>



<p>Takase and the others would likely wear bikinis too, and if some random guy saw Kotomi in a school swimsuit and laughed, she might get too self-conscious to enjoy the beach.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to stand out…”</p>



<p>“Then let’s buy you one.”</p>



<p>“B-But, I don’t think I’ll look good in a bikini…”</p>



<p><em>“There’s no high school girl who doesn’t look good in a bikini. How about I help you pick one that suits you, Kotomi-san?”</em></p>



<p>“Is it okay?”</p>



<p><em>“Of course. And while we’re at it, I can help Haruto-kun pick out some summer clothes, too.”</em></p>



<p>“Oh, that would be great. How about letting her pick out clothes for you too, Kotomi?”</p>



<p>“I’d love that!”</p>



<p><em>“That’s settled then. Do you think you two can go now?”</em></p>



<p>“I can go anytime!”</p>



<p>“Me too.”</p>



<p><em>“Okay, how about we meet at Kinjo Station in 30 minutes?”</em></p>



<p>“Got it. See you in 30 minutes.”</p>



<p>With that, we ended the call and got ready to head out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After meeting up with Momoi in front of Kinjo Station, she led us to a clothing store encased entirely in glass amidst the oppressive heat. Mannequins struck poses along the walls, draped in fashionable attire.</p>



<p>“D-Do you come here often?” </p>



<p>Kotomi seemed apprehensive in this fashion-forward environment. Despite trying to maintain my brotherly dignity, I was feeling a bit uneasy myself.</p>



<p>“Not really. It’s not my style. I came here once before with Naru-chan.” </p>



<p>“Did Takase-san shop here too?”</p>



<p>“Just for winter wear. Want to try a different store?”</p>



<p>“No, this is fine, but…” Kotomi glanced at her reflection in the glass, looking uncertain. “Do they have, like, a dress code here?”</p>



<p>Momoi chuckled, “Don’t worry, there’s no dress code. You and your brother are so alike, by the way.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“When I brought him here last time, he hesitated to come in, just like you. It was adorable, like a little animal.”</p>



<p>My face flushed at the teasing. Sure, I did hesitate to enter. The place looked like it was imported straight from overseas, so I felt a bit out of place. </p>



<p>But I had my pride as an older brother. I didn’t want Kotomi to think of me as some timid creature.</p>



<p>“You must be mistaken. I was totally confident. Like a lion.”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? Weren’t you nervously trailing behind me like a duckling?”</p>



<p>“I wasn’t. Kotomi, don’t be fooled. Your big brother was shopping like a pro.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be fooled, Kotomi-san. Your brother was really nervous in a new store.”</p>



<p>“Um, don’t fight because of me…”</p>



<p>Kotomi looked flustered. While I was arguing not for her sake but for my pride, I didn’t want to make Kotomi uncomfortable.</p>



<p>“W-we’re not fighting or anything, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, just stating the facts. But I’m the adult here, so I’ll back down. Let’s just say I was a bit nervous.”</p>



<p>“Hey, that’s not fair! Then it makes me look like a child!”</p>



<p>“Come on, Kotomi, stick close to your big brother.”</p>



<p>As I confidently entered the store, Kotomi seemed impressed. She shook her head to get rid of her nervousness and followed me inside.</p>



<p>“Don’t hesitate, Momoi, come on in.”</p>



<p>“I’m not hesitating.”</p>



<p>After Momoi entered the store, I let go of the door handle. Though it was a bit warm near the entrance due to the glass, it was cooler than outside. Taking a breath of relief in the comfortable ambiance with soothing music playing, Momoi stowed her sunglasses in her bag, while Kotomi looked around nervously.</p>



<p>“Whoa, there are so many stylish clothes here. Look, Haru-nii. Even the staff are stylish…”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s impressive,” I replied, scanning the store myself, “It’s all women’s stuff, though. Do they have men’s clothes here?” </p>



<p>“Yeah, on the second floor. I’ll help Kotomi-san pick her clothes first. What about you, Haruto-kun? Are you going to look around on your own?” </p>



<p>“Nah, let’s stick together.”</p>



<p>“Like a duckling following its mom?” </p>



<p>She really liked teasing me. She was gentle with girls but why did she only have this sadistic streak with me?</p>



<p>Well, it did make things easier to handle. No need for restraint on my end.</p>



<p>“I’ll follow confidently, like a lion.”</p>



<p>“Make sure you don’t get lost.”</p>



<p>“As if I’d get lost…”</p>



<p>The store had great visibility.</p>



<p>“So, Kotomi-san, any preferences for your clothes?” </p>



<p>“Preferences?”</p>



<p>“Like if you prefer skirts or certain colors.”</p>



<p>“I’d feel embarrassed in really flashy colors. And I don’t like mini-skirts…”</p>



<p>“Then maybe pants are better?”</p>



<p>“It’s trousers.”</p>



<p>When I corrected Momoi, she raised an eyebrow in annoyance.</p>



<p>“Unbelievable. You’re still saying that?”</p>



<p>“That’s my line.”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?” Kotomi asked, looking confused.</p>



<p>Momoi was exasperated, “Your brother is adamant about calling pants ‘trousers.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Pants are pants, and trousers are trousers, aren’t they?”</p>



<p>Perhaps thinking Kotomi would back her up, this unexpected support for me caught Momoi off guard. </p>



<p>She pointed at my trousers and asked, “What about these?”</p>



<p>“Trousers.”</p>



<p>“Technically, they’re tapered trousers.”</p>



<p>“Oh… Haru-nii, you’re so knowledgeable!”</p>



<p>“That’s not it! They’re pants! Tapered pants! Don’t let him confuse you, Kotomi-san.”</p>



<p>“I’m just stating the facts.”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah… trousers are trousers, right?” </p>



<p>“Trousers are pants, and shorts are underwear!”</p>



<p>“Give it up, Momoi. It’s two against one, trousers win,” I gloated.</p>



<p>Momoi grumbled in frustration, “Ugh, I know I’m right…”</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry. I’ll call them pants from now on.”</p>



<p>Kotomi suddenly switched sides. Turning the tables, Momoi flashed a grin and looked at me triumphantly, “Victory is mine! Pants supporters win by a two to one margin!”</p>



<p>Momoi high-fived Kotomi enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t steal my sister!”</p>



<p>“Too bad. Looks like Kotomi-san prefers me.”</p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate the bond between twins!”</p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate the power of friendship, either!”</p>



<p>“Whoa… I can’t believe I’m being fought over…” Kotomi looked ecstatic.</p>



<p>During our lunch break in elementary school, we played games like relay races and dodgeball. The leader got to choose their teammates by winning rock-paper-scissors, but Kotomi always ended up being picked last. Maybe that was a bit traumatic for her.</p>



<p>Seeing Kotomi in such high spirits, whether they were called pants or trousers didn’t seem to matter anymore.</p>



<p>“Let’s pick something already.”</p>



<p>“Right. If you see something you like, don’t hesitate to speak up, okay?” </p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>We began browsing through the clothes. After a while, Momoi pointed to a pair of trousers on a mannequin.</p>



<p>“What about these?”</p>



<p>“I don’t have legs long enough for those…”</p>



<p>“You’d have to roll up the cuffs a bunch to keep them from dragging.”</p>



<p>“But these are high-waisted, so they’d make your legs look great… Don’t you like them?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, they’re nice, but… I think I prefer skirt over pants. Short ones make me feel a bit self-conscious, but I’d like to try something cute… These pants aren’t bad either but… How much are they?”</p>



<p>“Um… they’re 12,000 yen.”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s eyes widened, “Huh!? Th-they’re that expensive…?”</p>



<p>“These are actually on the cheaper side… By the way, what’s your budget?”</p>



<p>“8,000 yen…” Kotomi said timidly. She had been excited when we left home, saying, <em>“With this much, I can get many stuff!”</em> But now, she was completely deflated.</p>



<p>“I should have asked about the budget before choosing a store.”</p>



<p>“Are there only expensive ones here?”</p>



<p>“I think there are some within your budget too.”</p>



<p>Momoi walked off again and picked up a collared dress from the rack. “How about this? It seems like it would suit you, Kotomi-san.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s really nice! But… the price…”</p>



<p>“It’s 7,980 yen.”</p>



<p>It was within her budget, but Kotomi’s smile disappeared. She looked worried as she asked, “…Can you buy a swimsuit for 20 yen?”</p>



<p>“You can’t buy one for that price… But is your total budget really 8,000 yen?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah… I was planning to spend around 6,000 yen on clothes and 2,000 yen on a swimsuit…”</p>



<p>“Hmm… 2,000 yen might be tight. It’s not impossible, but your options will be limited. How about we set the clothing budget at 5,000 yen and try another store?” </p>



<p>“That’s okay, but…” </p>



<p>It didn’t seem ideal. I could guess she loved the collared dress so much. She kept glancing at me as if she wanted to say something.</p>



<p><em>Well, it can’t be helped.</em></p>



<p>“I’ll lend you the money, so go ahead and buy it.”</p>



<p>“Are you sure…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. But don’t forget you already owe me 5,000 yen.”</p>



<p>Kotomi had 3,000 yen on hand. Although she probably had some savings, unlike me, she tended to spend it recklessly, that’s why Mom was holding onto her bankbook. Since Mom was out at work, Kotomi had consulted me before we left the house and I had lent her the money.</p>



<p>“I’ll pay you back as soon as I get my allowance!”</p>



<p>“Alright then.”</p>



<p>As I reached for my wallet in my back pocket, Momoi interrupted and turned to Kotomi. “Wait a sec. Kotomi-san, do you know your measurements?”</p>



<p>“I do, but… why?”</p>



<p>“If our body types are similar, I could lend you a swimsuit.”</p>



<p>“Is… is that okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I have plenty, so don’t hesitate. It probably not match your style, though.”</p>



<p>“That’s fine. Your style is definitely cute! Um, my measurements are…”</p>



<p>Even though we were twins, Kotomi seemed embarrassed to be asked about this. She whispered to Momoi.</p>



<p>“Oh, really?” Momoi looked surprised at Kotomi.</p>



<p>“Yeah. I might not look like it because of my posture…”</p>



<p>“Then maybe my swimsuits will work for you. But it’s better to try it on just in case. Do you have time later?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, plenty.”</p>



<p>“Then come over to my place and I’ll lend you the swimsuits.”</p>



<p>“Me too?”</p>



<p>“If you don’t have any plans.”</p>



<p>I wanted to go home and watch ‘<em>Miki-chan Wants to Swim,’</em> but from what I heard from Kotomi on the train, there were only 12 episodes. It was an original anime with no source material, so there was no rush to watch it.</p>



<p>Still…</p>



<p>“Are we not going to stop by a swimsuit shop?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you have a swimsuit?”</p>



<p>“Not that. I was actually planning to buy sunglasses.”</p>



<p>Seeing my classmates in swimsuits would definitely make me feel awkward. I could probanly endure seeing Aoki in one, but both Kotobuki and Momoi had big breasts. And as for Takase, well, it went without saying. If I were to see the swimsuits of the girl I liked up close, my eyes would surely wander.</p>



<p>To prevent that, sunglasses were a must. They probably had them at the 100-yen store, but since I had the budget, I’d prefer a stylish design if possible.</p>



<p>“If you want, you can have mine.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that too much to ask?”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. I have a lot of them.”</p>



<p>Even though she said that, I had received a watch from her not too long ago, and she had also bought me clothes. While I could accept a lunch treat, I hesitated to accept sunglasses from Momoi, especially considering they were probably high-end. It felt wrong to keep receiving things from her.</p>



<p>Seeing my hesitation, Momoi said earnestly, “You’re the one who’s going to help me avoid being hit on, so let me do this much for you.”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’m going reluctantly.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. With you there, I’m actually looking forward to it.”</p>



<p>Momoi blinked her blue eyes, looking a bit embarrassed as she glanced down, “…Are you really looking forward to seeing me in a swimsuit?”</p>



<p>“Not particularly. I’m just saying I’m looking forward to having fun with you at the beach.”</p>



<p>Of course, part of me did want to see Takase in a swimsuit. But I loved the sea, and I enjoyed hanging out with friends. I was confident I could have fun with Momoi alone too.</p>



<p>Momoi smiled happily.</p>



<p>“I like spending time with you too. It’s easygoing when we’re together. But honestly, having you there is a huge relief for me. I want to thank you, so if you’re okay with my sunglasses, I’ll give them to you. Plus, they’re taking up space at my place, it’s getting annoying.”</p>



<p>“I see. Well, if you put it that way, I’ll gladly accept. Thanks.”</p>



<p>Momoi smiled back, “Don’t mention it. Now, it’s time to pick out your clothes.”</p>



<p>We walked upstairs, where Momoi helped me choose some clothes. After we both paid at the counter, we hailed a taxi outside the store and headed to Momoi’s house.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>As the taxi meter approached 1,000 yen, we arrived in front of the Tower Mansion.</p>



<p>“Should I pay?”</p>



<p>“Keep that money for the return trip.”</p>



<p>When I offered from the passenger seat, Momoi was already pulling out her wallet.</p>



<p>Since the station was about two kilometers away, I had considered walking, but then I realized I didn’t know the way back. I could use a navigation app, but with Kotomi here too, it’d be better to just take a taxi back.</p>



<p>After Momoi paid the fare, we got off. In front of us stood the towering apartment building.</p>



<p>“It’s huge.”</p>



<p>“I feel like my neck’s gonna hurt…”</p>



<p>“We can’t see the top if fog rolls in.”</p>



<p>“It’s like a final boss’s dungeon.”</p>



<p>I thought it was a bit much to compare someone’s house to a final boss’s lair, but Momoi found it amusing. She chuckled and said, “I’ll take a picture if there’s a fog,” as we walked on.</p>



<p>Following her swaying blonde hair, we stepped into the entrance. While Kotomi seemed a bit intimidated by the luxurious space with its black marble flooring, Momoi pressed the elevator button.</p>



<p>“What floor is your place on?”</p>



<p>“The 30th floor.”</p>



<p>“It must get crowded in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Not really. There are separate elevators for lower and higher floors. Well, I still have to wait a bit, though.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it stressful when you’re in a hurry?”</p>



<p>“I always leave with plenty of time, so it’s not a problem.”</p>



<p>“You’re quite organized.”</p>



<p>When we chatted aimlessly, the elevator arrived. The three of us got in and headed to the 30th floor.</p>



<p>“Do you usually buy your merchandise online, Momoi-san?”</p>



<p>“I mostly buy them at stores. Why do you ask?”</p>



<p>“Since you’re living on the 30th floor, it must be a hassle to get deliveries…”</p>



<p>“True, I guess it could be a hassle to have someone come up every time.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, there’s a delivery box on the first floor. I just prefer seeing the products in person before buying.”</p>



<p>“Must be nice having ‘Paradise’ nearby.”</p>



<p>“It is! I was so excited when I found that anime shop online!”</p>



<p>“They have a good selection of niche items and capsule toys too.”</p>



<p>“Exactly! Just browsing for new stuff is fun! There are so many rubber straps and can badges that I’ve got duplicates of. Wanna trade later?”</p>



<p>“Oh, sure! Let’s do a trading session with the three of us next time!”</p>



<p><em>Wait, me too!? I didn’t even have one, let alone duplicates!</em></p>



<p>Guess I’d have to play it cool and say I wasn’t really into gacha… It wouldn’t be unusual for me to be that kind of otaku, right?</p>



<p>“Haruto-kun has lots of duplicates too, right? You mentioned having a bunch before.”</p>



<p><em>She had got me cornered already! </em>Kotomi was shooting me awkward glances!</p>



<p>I could just ask Kotomi for the capsule toys, but I doubt the trading session would end with just that. I’d need to know about these duplicate characters. How many series did I need to watch…?</p>



<p>“Well, um, maybe sometime…”</p>



<p>For now, I’d just buy some time with that response.</p>



<p>Besides, watching anime that Kotomi got into was fun, and I wouldn’t be alone with Momoi during the trading session. With Kotomi around, I could manage somehow.</p>



<p>We reached the 30th floor and stepped out of the elevator. Momoi led the way as we walked down the hallway.</p>



<p>“Here we are.”</p>



<p>She stopped and opened the door.</p>



<p>It seemed like she kept shoes she didn’t wear often in the shoebox. There was only one pair of loafers in the entrance, making the space felt quite spacious.</p>



<p>The glossy hallway made me hesitate to walk on it with sweaty socks.</p>



<p>“Here you go.”</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing my thoughts, Momoi brought out a pair of slippers. I gratefully slipped them on and followed her into the room.</p>



<p>We were led into the living-dining room. It was spacious enough to fit both Kotomi’s and my rooms. Bright sunlight streamed in through the windows, offering a balcony with a panoramic view beyond.</p>



<p>When Momoi turned on the air conditioning, Kotomi’s eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>



<p>“Wow, the TV is huge! The speakers are amazing! The sofa is massive! It’s like a bed! And look at all these Miku-chan cushions! There are so many! It’s incredible!”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s enthusiasm was infectious. She was excited to be in her friend’s house for the first time. I could understand her excitement. I remember feeling the same when I entered Takase’s room for the first time.</p>



<p>“This TV is seriously big! Do you usually watch anime here?”</p>



<p>“I have one in my bedroom too, but I mostly watch here.”</p>



<p>“Do you watch with your family?”</p>



<p>“Nope. My mom’s not around, and my dad rarely comes home, so I watch alone.”</p>



<p>“Oh…”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s smile disappeared.</p>



<p>I had heard that Momoi’s mother passed away when she was twelve due to illness. They used to live in England, but she moved to Japan, her father’s homeland, because she didn’t want to be constantly reminded of her mother. </p>



<p>Although Momoi said she had come to terms with it, whenever she talked about her family, there was a hint of sadness in her expression.</p>



<p>“I’m free every day, so feel free to invite me whenever you want to watch anime!”</p>



<p>That’s probably why she was happy that Kotomi asked. Perhaps she thought she’d made things awkward by bringing up a sensitive topic. She looked momentarily surprised before putting on a bright smile.</p>



<p>“Come stay over during the summer break! Let’s pull an all-nighter watching anime together!”</p>



<p>“I’d love to! Count me in for a sleepover!”</p>



<p>Even though we were friends, Momoi probably didn’t intend to let a guy stay over. Kotomi, still bubbling with excitement, glanced around eagerly.</p>



<p>“If you need to use toilet, it’s the door on the left from the entrance.”</p>



<p>“No, I was wondering if you had any figures or something.”</p>



<p>“They are in my bedroom. Wanna see my collection?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely!”</p>



<p>“Should I wait here then?”</p>



<p>I knew the answer, but I asked anyway. As expected, Momoi shook her head.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I don’t have anything I’d mind you seeing.”</p>



<p>In that case, I’d just go right in without hesitation.</p>



<p>Momoi’s bedroom connected directly from the living room, and beyond the door was a western-style room about the size of twelve tatami mats.</p>



<p>“Whoa…”</p>



<p>As soon as we entered, Kotomi’s mouth fell open.</p>



<p>The room was dominated by a glass display shelf covering an entire wall, creating an impressive space.</p>



<p>There were shelves lined with music-themed figures made of acrylic stands, shelves lined with girls in school uniforms, shelves with girls in swimsuits, and even separate sections for battle-themed figures, neatly categorized by swords, guns, and magic.</p>



<p>I had seen photos during our second offline meetup, but that was just a glimpse of her collection. Momoi’s figure collection was truly amazing, even to someone like me who wasn’t really into otaku culture.</p>



<p>“You’ve really gone all out collecting these.”</p>



<p>“Aren’t they awesome?”</p>



<p>Momoi was beaming with pride. Since she had been living as a closet otaku for so long, it was her first time showing her collection to friends. She looked happy to be able to show it off.</p>



<p>“Momoi-san, can I take some photos?”</p>



<p>“Sure. You can even pick them up if you want.”</p>



<p>“Really? Yay! Thanks, Momoi-san!”</p>



<p>Kotomi was ecstatic. Despite her excitement, she handled the figures with care, carefully picking them up and examining them from various angles.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you going to take any pictures, Haruto-kun?”</p>



<p>“With this many, I don’t even know where to start. How many figures do you have?”</p>



<p>“Including the acrylic stands, it’s over a hundred.”</p>



<p>“Amazing… Do you have a favorite among these?”</p>



<p>“It’s hard to choose… but if I had to, maybe Oda Nobunaga. It was the first figure I ever got.”</p>



<p>“Nobunaga, huh?”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Momoi had some tough-looking figures in her collection.</p>



<p>“You’re into Nobunaga too, Haruto-kun?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>“Then let me show you!”</p>



<p>As one of the Three Great Unifiers of Japan, I was naturally interested in his figure. Did they turn his iconic portrait from the textbooks into a figure, or depicted him in his Nanban armor with a cape—</p>



<p>“Ta-da!”</p>



<p>She brought out a blond girl in a swimsuit.<sup data-fn="69d98f0b-c8b1-40d6-9f7d-04d5a013f861" class="fn"><a href="#69d98f0b-c8b1-40d6-9f7d-04d5a013f861" id="69d98f0b-c8b1-40d6-9f7d-04d5a013f861-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p>“What do you think? Isn’t it amazing?”</p>



<p>“Uh, yeah, it’s something…”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010501.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p><em>It looked nothing like the Nobunaga I knew! </em>Yet Momoi was smiling brightly. It didn’t seem like she had mistaken the figure for someone else.</p>



<p>As I struggled to comprehend the blonde girl figure I was being shown, Kotomi suddenly exclaimed.</p>



<p>“Whoa, it’s Nobunaga! The detail’s incredible!”</p>



<p>“Right!? They’ve faithfully reproduced the glossy blond hair and the curves of her chest! Isn’t it awesome!?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it is!”</p>



<p>They were getting all excited about a Nobunaga I had never heard of. It felt like I had stumbled into a parallel universe.</p>



<p>Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I stepped away from the figure shelf and noticed the manga shelf.</p>



<p>“You don’t have that many manga.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, they take up space. I switched to ebooks halfway through. But for manga I really like, I still buy the physical copies for the benefits.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see… Hey, you’ve got a lighter displayed here.”</p>



<p>I spotted a MioMio metal lighter on the desk. There was also a smartphone stand, a fan, plushies, and an apron draped over the chair. Even the zebra keychain I got her recently was there.</p>



<p>Seeing them displayed in such a special place made me happy to know they were cherished.</p>



<p>“Thanks for the wonderful presents, guys. I’ll make sure to return the favor on your birthdays.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be looking forward to it!”</p>



<p>“Me too!”</p>



<p>Momoi smiled at our response, and then she suddenly remembered something.</p>



<p>“Oh, speaking of presents, I have to give you guys swimsuits and sunglasses!”</p>



<p>With that, she retrieved a storage case from under her closet and popped it open, revealing over ten pairs of sunglasses neatly arranged inside.</p>



<p>“There are so many different kinds.”</p>



<p>The lenses varied in color and shape, but they all exuded a sense of luxury. If I was getting these, I better made sure to prevent any guys from getting close to Momoi.</p>



<p>“It gets boring if they’re all the same. Which one do you want?”</p>



<p>“I can choose anything?”</p>



<p>“Of course. If it’s too hard to decide, I can pick for you.”</p>



<p>“Alright then, I’ll leave it to you. Just pick one that you think suits me.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Any preferences?”</p>



<p>“Something that doesn’t let my eyes show through. And preferably not a weird shape.”</p>



<p>“I don’t remember buying anything weird… would you like a square-shaped one?”</p>



<p>“Which one?”</p>



<p>“This one.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that looks nice!”</p>



<p>It was exactly the black rectangular sunglasses I had in mind. I tried them on and checked my reflection; my eyes were properly concealed. With these, I wouldn’t give away my nervousness even when I saw them in swimsuits.</p>



<p>“Are you sure I can have this?”</p>



<p>“Yep, it’s yours.”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much! I’ll take good care of them!”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome,” Momoi said with a smile, “Now, onto swimsuits. I’ll call you when we’re done. Can you wait in the living room?”</p>



<p>“Roger that.”</p>



<p>I left the two in the bedroom and made my way to the living room. Settling onto the couch, I idly tapped away on my phone until I was called from the other side of the door, “You can come in!”</p>



<p>I opened the door, finding Kotomi in a bikini. It was a brown color, with one shoulder strap hanging off. It must had been designed that way rather than torn.</p>



<p>“H-How do I look? Not weird…?” she asked, shyly averting her gaze. Even without sunglasses, I managed to keep my composure at the sight of my sister in a swimsuit.</p>



<p>“It suits you.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. With that, you’ll blend right in at the beach. Have fun swimming.”</p>



<p>“Yay! I can’t wait to hit the beach! Thank you, Momoi-san!”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome. Let’s have lots of fun!”</p>



<p>“Totally!”</p>



<p>I left the excited pair in the room and waited again in the living room. Shortly after, they both came out.</p>



<p>Now then, our purpose for coming here had been fulfilled, but it felt wrong to just take the gifts and say goodbye. It was only just past four. If Momoi wanted to hang out, I guess we could stick around…</p>



<p>“By the way, how are you two feeling? Are you hungry?”</p>



<p>“We’re kinda hungry.”</p>



<p>“We didn’t really eat much for lunch.”</p>



<p>Momoi looked at us with concern, “Are you feeling unwell?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s just that we’ll be having sushi tonight.”</p>



<p>“It’s a reward for working hard on exams.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see. In that case, you better work up an appetite.”</p>



<p>Momoi frowned disappointedly. She probably wanted to treat us to a meal. Considering all the things we had received, I shouldn’t let her down.</p>



<p>“If I say I’m hungry, are you gonna make fried rice?”  </p>



<p>“That was the plan, but… are you really hungry?”</p>



<p>Seeing an expectant look in her eyes, I nodded, “I have a separate stomach for your fried rice.”  </p>



<p>“Then I’ll get cooking!”  </p>



<p>With a cheerful bounce in her voice, Momoi headed to the bedroom and returned wearing an apron. It was the one with a dog peeking out of the pocket that Takase had gifted her.</p>



<p>“I’ll whip it up real quick, so just relax and watch some anime.”  </p>



<p>“Then I’m gonna watch Driste,” I said, trying to steer clear of anime I didn’t know and impending stomach churn it brought.  </p>



<p>“Then let’s watch the live scenes! The sound’s way better than at home!”  </p>



<p>“Sounds good to me.”</p>



<p>Kotomi promptly turned on the TV. It seemed Momoi had subscribed to the same streaming service as us, as Kotomi navigated the remote with ease and selected a live episode of Doriste.  </p>



<p>We fast forward through the opening and began watching from the live scene. The dynamic sound from the large speakers filled the room, lifting our spirits effortlessly.</p>



<p>“It feels like we’re at the concert!”  </p>



<p>“The difference in power is insane.”  </p>



<p>“The three of us should go to a concert together someday!”</p>



<p>“I’m totally down! I wanna wave a glow stick!”</p>



<p>“If we buy tons of merch at the booth and then hitting karaoke on the way back, it’ll be so much fun, right?”  </p>



<p>“That sounds like a blast!”  </p>



<p>Both of us were really getting into it. I was interested in concerts too, and if we went, I’d just have to watch the related anime beforehand. I’d definitely tag along if they did decide to go.  </p>



<p>As I was pondering this, Momoi started to cook. A slightly crispy aroma wafted over. Last time, the seasoning didn’t have much flavor, but now I could smell the soy sauce. She said she had been improving day by day, so maybe I could look forward to this.</p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting!”  </p>



<p>When the live episode wrapped up, Momoi brought over the fried rice.  </p>



<p>“Whoa, it looks delicious!” Kotomi said. She wasn’t just being polite, it genuinely did look appetizing.  </p>



<p>The rice was a bit mushy last time, but now it looked fluffy. The ingredients were finely chopped, and the thinly sliced pork tantalized the taste buds.</p>



<p>“Eat it while it’s hot.”  </p>



<p>“Will do.”  </p>



<p>I took a spoonful and tasted it. The flavors of salt, pepper, and soy sauce were perfectly blended with a hint of sesame oil. The rice was stir-fried to perfection, each grain bursting with flavor.</p>

</figure>



<p>“This is delicious!”</p>



<p>“Really!?”  </p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s so good. If they served this in the cafeteria, I’d eat it every day.”  </p>



<p>“I’m happy you like it so much… hehe.”</p>



<p>Momoi smiled happily, and it was contagious. Her happiness somehow made me happy too.  </p>



<p>“I owe you a big thank you.”  </p>



<p>“Why me?”  </p>



<p>“Because it’s all thanks to you that I can make delicious fried rice now.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t do anything. You’re the one who worked hard.”  </p>



<p>“No, it’s because of you. Your motivation makes all the difference.”</p>



<p>Was she the type who thrive on praise? Even though her improvement was all her own effort,when she said that, I couldn’t bring myself to deny it.</p>



<p>“If you want, I can praise you more. Oh, you’ve mastered yakisoba and neapolitan too, right?”</p>



<p>“Yep! I’ve got those down. I’ll make them for you next time, so come hang out during summer break. Both of you are welcome.”</p>



<p>“Yeah! I’ll definitely come over!”</p>



<p>“But you gotta do your homework first.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s do our homework together. With you here, Haruto-kun, we’ll finish in no time. Then we can have all summer to play!”</p>



<p>“Yay!”</p>



<p>While I preferred Kotomi to do her own homework, it sounded like it could be fun with Momoi around. When I agreed to that plan, the two of them happily exchanged high-fives.</p>
