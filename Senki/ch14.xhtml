<h1>Chapter 14: Is There A Single Member Of This Department That Cares About Me?</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’re saying this guy attacked you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I hit his leg from the royal palace… but I had to deal with close combat afterwards. Ahh, I can’t believe I was almost done in by an injured opponent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were any more ashamed, I’d be ending my life with my own hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just defeated the man in black, moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san had arrived soon after, and I was currently explaining the situation to him. The poison had induced some kind of temporary paralysis, but it was quickly wearing off. I didn’t feel great, but at least I was conscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I was glad. If I were paralyzed for a few hours more, I would have to be carried back to my office. Knowing my fellow magicians, I’d never hear the end of it. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to preserve what little dignity I have left!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out a piece of knife from my robe pocket and handed it to Elt-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this the knife that he threw?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the one. To be honest, I still can’t believe it. That someone can throw this from here to the royal palace. I never really realized how far it was. And to think that I’ve been hitting even farther every morning…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It sounds sarcastic when you add that last part, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man’s body lay at Elt-san’s feet. He had a hole in his chest that was scorched around the edges. I took a moment to appreciate the precision of the magic that caused it, but something further up caught my eye. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this…?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Elt-san nudged me before I could speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at his neck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The neck was covered with magical runes that I had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mental Domination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san answered the question in my head with an iciness that I didn’t expect from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mental Domination… I had only ever heard of it before. As its name suggests, it forcefully takes control of someone’s consciousness and lets the caster manipulate the victim as they please. It’s forbidden magic of the highest level. According to law, anyone who learns or uses it is assigned the death penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He probably wasn’t even conscious. He just acted on a command to kill you. I can’t explain how he threw so far, but I’m absolutely certain there are other enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That explains why he didn’t respond to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It has to be. I can’t give an exact measure, but from what I can see, the magic is strong. If it makes you feel any better, I don’t think he felt any pain when he died.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I felt a little sympathetic. Guilty, even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he had physically tried to kill me, he wasn’t in control of himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rested my hands gently on the body. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I pray that your soul will be saved.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…In any case, you seem to be pretty familiar with this type of magic. Did you perhaps read something about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t use it, but I’ve seen a similar magic formula. It’s easily recognizable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that’s surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san wasn’t exactly the first person I’d have expected to be knowledgeable about this subject. Well, they do say to never judge a book by its cover. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That doesn’t change the fact that he should really stop skipping work, though.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was saved this time, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something wrong? You look serious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“.……….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know if he heard me, but he didn’t respond. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is going on?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I’d never seen Elt-san like this before. He was at best easygoing and at worst annoying, but this was neither.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds later, he suddenly shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? If you’re not feeling well, you should go home today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about me. You’re still poisoned, aren’t you? You seem awfully eager to go back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that. I’m just standing because it’s worn off already… although to be honest, I still feel a bit nauseous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t take me for an idiot, I know how strong that poison was. I’ll carry him for you, so let’s hurry back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After rapping me on the head, Elt-san took off toward the royal palace with the body slung over his shoulder. He didn’t seem burdened by it at all, so I assumed he was using physical enhancement.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, I never said I could run.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Wasn’t he just worrying about mea moment ago? All that talk amounted to nothing. I wanted to protest, but he was too far ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I put up with the nausea and hobbled back to the palace on my own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m dying…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look pale. How was the trip?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such heartless words, the moment I entered the lounge. Milena-san, Arina-san, and Elt-san were all looking at me, undoubtedly coming up with more creative jokes to make about the situation. I’m tired of asking this, but does no one here care about me? I did once speak highly of the workplace benefits, but considering everything else… Did I make a mistake in getting this job?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or so I would have liked to ponder, but I had a bigger problem at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m sorry for… I don’t know, being poisoned?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard. Come over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I protested but did as Milena-san said. She put her finger on my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the same feeling as when I met Her Highness the other day. I shivered a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—Detoxification.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Milena-san said the spell, a pleasant warmth spread from her fingertip throughout my body. The headache that had been assaulting me a moment ago vanished, and I felt healthier than I had ever been in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you feel better?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thank you so much. That was amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can’t sway me with compliments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smirked in that way that only a beautiful older woman could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The magic she used on me is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Light Attribute Short-Range Intermediate Magic—Detoxification</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. It’s healing magic that specifically targets poisons and other harmful substances within the body. I’m an attacker, so I can only use the bare minimum of healing magic. At best, I can sterilize a wound and maybe accelerate the regeneration. In other words, anything beyond a shallow wound is out of my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve tried many times to learn more advanced healing magic, but to no avail. Perhaps I just don’t have the talent for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyways, back to the matter at hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure you already heard what happened, so I’ll be brief. There will probably be more attacks like this in the future. In my opinion, we need to come up with some countermeasures. Not just us, but the whole palace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I’ve already notified each department by communication stone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As much as I hated the jokes she made, I had to respect her competence as the department head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the problem was far from resolved. We had to find out who was controlling the man and why he was sent after me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But for it to be now, of all times…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree, the timing isn’t great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you guys talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san and Arina-san chimed in with what sounded like meaningful comments, but I didn’t understand at all. Elt-san turned to face me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raize, you only came to the royal capital a few months ago, so you might not know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I forgot about that. Did you live in a remote forest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A remote forest, in which hides a remote village. How poetic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop making fun of me. I’ll have both of you know that it’s a very respectable village.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My village wasn’t the largest or the busiest, and if I had to choose between secretive or not I’d pick secretive, but it felt weird to be saying it about my own hometown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san laughed at our exchange and explained for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In five days, there will be an anniversary celebration of the kingdom’s founding. This year is the millennial. The royal family will be parading around the city. But as you can probably tell, the longer they’re exposed to the public, the more liabilities there are. The Founding Festival is an exciting affair every year, but this time it’ll be on an entirely different scale. —I’m sorry, there’s a correspondence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san walked away with a device embedded with a luminescent communication stone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timing couldn’t have been worse. The royal family will be properly escorted, of course, but anything could happen. They had better think carefully about who to pick as guards. Only the strongest… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san, why are you grinning at me?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just got a call. About the royal family’s guards on the day of the Founding Festival.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t see why it matters to us. They hate us, so we’re probably maintaining public order or something on the day of, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Except for Raize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does that mean that I have another job? Could it perhaps be a mission to keep watch from the annex and deal with suspicious figures from afar? The idea was not unpleasant to me, actually. I much preferred that over working in crowds or with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited expectantly. Milena-san smiled mischievously and told me my orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the day of the Founding Festival, you are to—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard my task, my heart plummeted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sorely mistaken.</span></p>
