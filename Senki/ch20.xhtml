<h1>Chapter 20: Trouble Consultation</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After going around the festival and trying various foods, we entered a café with a private room.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ambient music was playing in the background, and the aroma of aged wood filled the air. I was surprised that there were few customers today, but I suspected that was because everyone was out enjoying the festival. All the better for staying inconspicuous.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you enjoying the festival so far?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached for my cup of tea. Her Highness was sitting across from me. Although the room was private, I kept the recognition spell activated.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it’s so much fun. I can walk around and eat whatever I want. I don’t have to worry about keeping up appearances or anything.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s good to hear. I’m glad I can enjoy it with you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. That’s good to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She copied my response with a sly smile. Dangerously cute. But I will never do anything to stretch my nose here. I don’t want to look like a sloppy guy!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I was surprised when I saw your dress earlier.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it look weird?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness fidgeted anxiously. Seeing the worry on her face, I laughed and clarified myself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it looks good on you. What you normally wear is nice, of course, but this kind of clothing is attractive too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d even say I like it better. I’m not really used to anything high-end. I’m only a commoner, after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked down at her town-girl style dress. This was probably her only chance to wear it, so I guess she wanted to enjoy it while she could. Don’t all upper-class people want to try that kind of stuff sometimes?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, what I had said to Her Highness were my true feelings. Aristocratic clothing intimidates me. It just reminds me of the difference between our social statuses. Rather than expensive fabric and gaudy decorations, I much prefer simple, quieter clothing. I don’t even need jewelry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere changed the moment I addressed her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone who will remain unnamed—although you can probably guess—consulted with me about you. Apparently, you seem troubled these days.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness looked down and fell silent. So I was on the right track.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine if you don’t want to answer, but you’ll feel better if you talk to someone about it, won’t you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered gently when I talked to her. I don’t want her to feel like I’m forcing her to talk to me, but I’m just going to ask her to tell me her worries. I didn’t break from my stance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness opened her mouth for a moment and closed it again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to be hesitating. Should I be honest or should I just hide it? I can’t make up my mind because of the conflict. I understand that feeling very well. You don’t have to hurry. I’ll be waiting until you give me an answer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“…………from the other day.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness began to speak in a murmur-like manner. Apparently, she’ll tell me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since the other day, the appearance of the royal guards has been acting a little strange.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is strange?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it’s rude to say that it’s inhumane, but should I say that? Their skin is unusually white, their mouth is unusually quiet, and their tone of language is always the same when they talk… it’s like I’m talking to a tool that’s not human.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tools…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the man who attacked me the other day that passed through my mind. It’s no exaggeration to say that he’s great at it. I’ve got a glimpse of his movements and combat skills, and he doesn’t show any emotions when he’s facing each other.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">What I can say to the man in my memory is the same as what she said about the royal guards. It’s not human, it’s like a tool.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">No, in his case, he was already under the spell of mind control, so he was still a tool for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Tools?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“? What’s the matter?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness asks questions, but he runs his thoughts without answering.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness said, “It’s like a tool.” The man I met was enchanted by mind control and turned into a tool himself. If that man’s situation applies to the Imperial Guard, too.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the evening, I think you’ll be heading for the parade. Were the royal guards closest to you then?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no… I’m sure it wasn’t the royal guards. The closest are court magicians. I’ve heard that the royal guards will surround it and escort us.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness answered with a slight hesitation, without saying whether I was there or not.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">So is it the magicians I’ve heard of who escorts her vicinity? It may be expected that he will have some skills to protect the royal family, but anxiety remains.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, please keep your anxiety in the corner of your mind. You wouldn’t be put into danger. However, it’s not good to consult someone you don’t trust. If you find out that you’re aware of something, there’s a possibility that the danger will increase further. Please keep it in your own heart.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, don’t express your anxiety. There is a possibility that someone will make a strange guess. Try to be as normal as possible and behave as usual. It’s okay. You may not be able to see me during the parade, but I’ll protect you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up and took her hand, looked at her beautiful eyes, and said it.  And Her Highness’ face gradually turned red, and she looked down.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… Thank you for your cooperation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me. Long-range guards are my exclusive expertise.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">When I spoke confidently, she looked up and laughed with a smile.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I was able to dispel some of her worries.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, my job is going to be real after this. No matter what happens, I must protect Her Highness from shadows.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many factors of anxiety, such as the royal guards and demons, but we have no choice but to do so.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Secretly burning with fighting spirit, I smiled back at her.</span></p>
