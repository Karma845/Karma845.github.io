<h3>Chapter 2: Tokami Riku Will Not Be Conquered</h3>

<p>From the time I wake up, I feel like I'm still in a dream.</p>

<p>The reason is, of course, because of Mimori Yui.</p>

<p>Confession, lovers, and... the kiss. Yesterday was like a series of every man's dreams, to the point where I started doubting if this is really the reality.</p>

<p>Because of that, I couldn't sleep well last night.</p>

<p>While holding onto the strap of the train, I let out a soft yawn... and then my phone suddenly vibrating.</p>

<p>It was a message from Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning. Let's do our best again today.&quot;</p>

<p>...Yeah, this is reality.</p>

<p>I'm still confused. I mean, I'm a guy who claims to be anti-romance, you know? Am I gonna be okay from now on? My house will not get burn or something like that right?</p>

<p>But Mimori's feelings are precious, so maybe I'll go see her during lunch break.</p>

<p>Arriving at the school, the first thing I did, was to look for a certain someone.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Takahashi-kun. Can I talk to you for a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's up? Whoaaa... Tokami huh? What is it so sudden?&quot;</p>

<p>Is it really that surprising for someone who doesn't usually talk, approach you?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I have something I want to ask... about Mimori Yui.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>Takahashi-kun clearly frowned.</p>

<p>I know it's not a topic he wants to discuss, but I want him to bear with me. After all, I have no friends, and I don't know how people view her.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard this from a Kouhai, but male students who are involved with Mimori are looked down upon by others. Has there always been someone like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I haven't heard much about it lately. But there were apparently a few guys trying to get close to Mimori. After all, it's an easy chance to get some of that experience, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............And then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know if they were successful or not, but once everyone's know that they approach Mimori, they will get completely ignoration from girls, after all, Mimori is girls enemies. It's only natural for boys who approach her to be despised.&quot;</p>

<p>I recall the image of Mimori being isolated and alone in the classroom.</p>

<p>I see, I knew Mimori was being treated as an outcast, but I didn't realize it was to this extent. Mimori and Suzune are good hearted person, so they choose their words carefully, but in Takahashi-kun's case, it sounds raw and direct.</p>

<p>&quot;So, it's better for you, not to think about weird things, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Weird things? Like what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like trying to lose your virginity with Mimori or something. You're going to be at this school for another year or more. It's not funny to socially ruin yourself for the sake of a one-time experience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm not thinking about that kind of stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps because I felt Mimori was being ridiculed. That's why my tone became brusque.</p>

<p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>During lunch break, I peeked into Mimori's classroom, and she was nowhere to be found there.</p>

<p>She's probably eating somewhere else. The only place that comes to my mind... is there.</p>

<p>So, I leave the school building, move my ass to the club building, and knock the door of the usual room she goes to.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori, want to grab a bite together if you're here?&quot;</p>

<p>The door opens, and Mimori appears, half surprised and half dumbfounded.</p>

<p>At that moment, I could feel my body tensing up, and I knew it myself. After all, the girl who says she likes me is right in front of me. It's only natural to be nervous.</p>

<p>As I enter the club room, Mimori looks at me with eyes that seem to want to say something.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, why did you come all the way here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I kinda want to.... Mimori, you look like you want to ask for something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was unexpected for you to come and see me... I was planning to avoid being together with you as much as possible at school. I even planned to have lunch alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If our relationship gets exposed, it will cause trouble for you. That's why any hint even just millimeters or even just nanometer of our connection shouldn't be exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori takes a step closer.</p>

<p>&quot;For example, I don't want my real name, registered in your phone. And going out together as a couple is also NG. It's also better to avoid going to the convenience store together. Having a meal together is also out of question. From now on, we should act like complete strangers, to the point of 'Mimori Yui? What's that? something delicious,' kind of that.&quot; (TL: NG = No Good)</p>

<p>This situation feels like, I'm a husband hiding my mistress or something.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand your feelings, but do we really need to go that far? I don't think there's anyone who would look at my phone anyways.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's always a possibility that someone might glance at it, right? We have to be cautious if there's even a slight chance... that our relationship gets exposed, you might lose your place at school. So promise me, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh... F-fine, fine. I understand. If you really insists on it.&quot;</p>

<p>I never expected Mimori, who always teases me, to be so desperate about this.</p>

<p>But what she said was true, I remember being looked down by my classmates just because I help Mimori to find her phone. So, if they find out that we're dating, I'm sure it'll be much worse than I could imagine.</p>

<p>&quot;Should we go back to the classroom then? It wouldn't be good if someone saw us, right?&quot; I proposed.</p>

<p>&quot;...No, since you came all this way anyway, let's eat together. Besides, we're already couple. I want to have a meal together at school at least once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Hmm, it's embarrassing when she calls us a couple... Is Mimori enjoying my reaction with that big smile on her face?</p>

<p>As we sit on the bench, Mimori opens her lunchbox. Inside are, classic bento items like hamburger and tamagoyaki. It is place carefully that exudes warmth.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, your lunch looks great. It's probably the most beautiful one I've ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think so? I just reheated leftovers from last night's dinner, so I didn't put much effort into it. But I'm sincerely happy that you like it. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>...Huh? The way of the conversation, could it be...</p>

<p>&quot;Could it be... you make this lunch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's right. I usually handle the cooking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Could it be your actually super talented?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Making a lunch is not that big deal, really.&quot;</p>

<p>No, that's not true. If it were up to me, I'd want to sleep for an extra five minutes in the morning. Being high school students ourselves, we understand how challenging it can be.</p>

<p>&quot;But still, it feels good to receive compliments. If you'd like, you can try it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really?&quot;</p>

<p>I can feel my heart pounding. I never expected I'd have the chance to taste Mimori's homemade food.</p>

<p>--And then, I realized how much I got carried away and felt a chill down my spine. It's not surprising that Mimori is actually good person, but what am I expecting?</p>

<p>The reason why I'm dating Mimori is because I don't want her to casually do sexual interaction with random guys. Don't hold onto useless romantic feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, sure. Since you made it with care, I'll gladly accept it. Should we exchange some of my side dishes for yours?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it. But promise me that you'll tell me your opinion of the taste, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you're okay with that...&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori nodded satisfied and picked up the tamagoyaki with her chopsticks...</p>

<p>And she brought it toward my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing, Mimori-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; You're going to try my cooking skill, right? So... here, say 'aah.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...No, no. We're a couple but, that's just too embarrassing and I'm not ready for that kind of thing yet. Just let me eat it normally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... If that's the case, then I will not let you eat it either.&quot;</p>

<p>...Eehh!?</p>

<p>&quot;After all, offering you my food is just an act of kindness. In the end, it's up to me whether I can give it to you or not, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I get what you're saying, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's why, if you doesn't say 'aah,' I could choose not to feed you. But then, that would mean breaking our promise, wouldn't it? After all, you agreed to give me your opinion on the taste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute, how did it come to that!?&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, her reasoning might actually valid? It's true that I promised to give her my opinion on the taste, and since the bento is her's, meaning she's free to give it to me or not.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Riku-kun, you have two choices. Say 'aah' and eat my food, or refuse and break our promise. Which one do you prefer?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori had a mischievous smile on her face... and then I remembered, what she said yesterday.</p>

<p>'--That's why I decided. I will definitely make you fall in love with me.'</p>

<p>Damn it, so that's what it was...!</p>

<p>I was so naive. Looking back at her declaration yesterday, there was no way Mimori and I would have an ordinary relationship. I should have considered that she would have some sort of strategy to make me fall for her.</p>

<p>Is the food offering part is also her plan? To make a feed me situation?</p>

<p>But wait a minute. Mimori didn't plan to have lunch with me. That means she created this situation within just a few minutes since I arrived...?</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, what will you do? ...I have some confidence in my cooking, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>I could feel my body temperature rising. I'm starting to see Mimori as someone from opposite sex.</p>

<p>It's just a verbal promise, after all. I could easily find an excuse to back out and leave things as it is.</p>

<p>...But wouldn't that be tarnishing Mimori's determination?</p>

<p>From the day onwards, Mimori will surely come up with schemes like this and try to force &quot;couple-like actions&quot; on me, but what if I really fall for her in future, how will I make a excuses for situation like this, without using the excuses, we're already in relationships?</p>

<p>The only way for me to maintain my pride here is through one thing&#9472;fighting, isn't it?</p>

<p>&quot;...Uhhh, well, I guess there's no helping it since I'm the one who said it anyways. Besides, we're already lovers, so this is totally normal, right?&quot;</p>

<p>With a blink, Mimori widened her eyes.</p>

<p>That's right, I must not falter.</p>

<p>With this, I won't fall in love with Mimori. I will make sure she understands that.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, you're not running away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, it's not strange, is it? I'm the one who said let's date.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, yeah, maybe....Thanks. Well then, say 'Ahh.'&quot;</p>

<p>Awkwardly opening my mouth, Mimori picked up the tamagoyaki and slowly brought it to my mouth.</p>

<p>The closer distance we were, the faster my heart rate goes. I want to turn my face away, but because I was saying &quot;Ahh,&quot; I couldn't do that either.</p>

<p>Tamagoyaki was bought and I chewed it.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it delicious?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm surprised. You're really good at cooking.&quot;</p>

<p>It was so delicious, to the point where it made me forget about the tension just moments ago.</p>

<p>The flavor of the tamagoyaki was enhanced mainly due to the choosing of the dashi. It's already noon but the texture is still fluffy and perfect. I never expected her to make such delicious food every day.</p>

<p>However, Mimori stared at me intently and said,</p>

<p>&quot;That's a normal feedback. I'm happy that you're praising me, but it's kind of disappointing. I thought you would be more flustered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!? W-Well, no, no. I'm also a high school student, so I won't get flustered just because of 'Ahh.' If you want, should I try another dish? It doesn't bother me at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Alright! I endured it...!</p>

<p>How about that, Mimori? Even I, cannot be always overwhelmed.</p>

<p>&quot;But, you're right. Now that I think about it, I don't really understand why 'Ahh' is embarrassing. It's just feeding someone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yeah. That's true. It's not really a big deal, it's just something labelled as normal couples do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True. If I have to say, it's like an indirect kiss, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gu-uhhn..!&quot; My mouth blew out.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, she's right. I was too nervous earlier to make that not cross on my mind. I really did put my mouth on Mimori's chopsticks...!</p>

<p>&quot;But if you really don't mind, shall I give you one more 'Aah'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's fine! I've had enough! Mimori-san's food was amazing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Are indirect kisses so embarrassing to you? ...Even though we did it direct kiss yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>...How can you say those words with a smile?</p>

<p>I guess I can't compete with this girl. She casually says such embarrassing things that makes me feel dizzy.</p>

<p>When it comes to this love thing, Mimori is far superior. I have no experience in relationships and I'm an inexperienced virgin, so there is no chance of me winning against someone like Mimori, who seems to be experienced with guys. If I'm a hero who has never defeated a single slime, Mimori is like a demon lord.</p>

<p>Defeating her is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I admit defeat. I was about to say that, but...</p>

<p>Click. The sound of the doorknob turning startled us.</p>

<p>Could it be someone's here?</p>

<p>But the door won't open easily because of the doorstopper. They will probably give up soon.... However, the sound of the knob turning continues, as if someone is forcefully open it.</p>

<p>Mimori made a quick decision.</p>

<p>&quot;Hide, Riku-kun. If we're seen alone together, it'll be your end.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there's a rule in this school, that 'when the door is lock means it's getting used' right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Normally, yes. But there's only one person I can think of. We need to act quickly before our relationship get discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the room is already cramped to hide. There's a locker, but it's too small for me.... That's when Mimori pointed a place.</p>

<p>Mimori was pointing at a window covered with a curtain, there's a cramp space in the window that seems only one person can only pass through.</p>

<p>...A few seconds later, there I was, pressed against the wall.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I tried to escape through the window but I ended up getting stuck in it.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, do you have any skills to dislocate your joints or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori-san, do you think I'm Prison Break Magician?&quot; (TL: Reference from Yoshie Shiratori.)</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then there's no choice but to force it. Ready, go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! Ouchouchouchouch!&quot;</p>

<p>It was painful, but thanks to Mimori pushing me, I somehow managed to get out. Mimori poked her face out of the window and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, bye-bye. Thanks for coming today... When you ate my food, it made me feel a little excited, like we were really lovers.&quot;</p>

<p>She left that remark with a smile and closed the window.</p>

<p>I should go back to the classroom before someone sees me... I know that in my head, but I can't help but be curious about Mimori, who remained behind. So, I hid and peeked through the window to see what was happening in the room.</p>

<p>After a while, the door opened, and several female students entered.</p>

<p>They were chatting and laughing happily, but their expressions froze when they noticed Mimori quietly eating her lunch.</p>

<p>&quot;M-Mimori-san? Why are you here...?&quot;</p>

<p>I see. So this is how everyone sees her.</p>

<p>It's true that there are rumors about several guys in Mimori's background, so I can understand why they would be surprised. ...Well, I don't believe those rumors though. Mimori is the kind of girl who confesses her love to guys like me.</p>

<p>The girls clearly seemed intimidated, but among them, there was one student who smirked confidently.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, what a surprise. I never expected Mimori to be here. Is eating alone fun?&quot;</p>

<p>She had a gyaru-like appearance&mdash;Manaka, who was in the same class as me.</p>

<p>In response to her sharp words, Mimori smiled softly and said,</p>

<p>&quot;I had a feeling it might be you, Manaka-san. You knew that I eat here sometimes, so you came all the way here on purpose, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about. We just wanted to eat while having a private conversation, so we came here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop lying. You knew I was inside, and yet you forcefully entered. ...Are you that desperate to see me? If you wanted to be friends with me, you could have just said so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...! No way! Who would be friends with a bitch like you?&quot;</p>

<p>So Mimori was referring to Manaka earlier huh....</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Manaka hates Mimori, doesn't she?</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway! ...We decided to eat here. So, why don't you just go somewhere else? We have conversations we don't want others to overhear.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh... I see now.</p>

<p>It seems that Manaka didn't come here by chance. She knew Mimori was here and purposely brought her friends along to harass her.</p>

<p>This situation is just... I honestly don't feel good watching it.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, go ahead. If you're fine eating in this dim room, go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Mimori slowly stood up from the bench.</p>

<p>For a moment, Manaka looked surprised, but then she said,</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, it's surprisingly considerate of you to give up the seat to us newcomers. Are you not dissatisfied with this is or you probably have no pride left?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not really picky to where I eat, so if you want to use it, go ahead. Besides, as you said, I'm alone anyway. I can eat whenever I want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't like that kind of attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the tension between them became heavy.</p>

<p>&quot;You're acting like you don't care about me. Are you mocking me? You took my boyfriend away, and you clearly didn't care about it, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been telling you, it's not like that. It's just a misunderstanding on your part--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think I'll believe your words from a slut like you?&quot;</p>

<p>Sh*t, how did it come to this?</p>

<p>The atmosphere here is like explosive. But in that moment, I found myself walking towards the clubroom door.</p>

<p>Oh no, I shouldn't be getting involved in this kind of troublesome matters like this.</p>

<p>I lightly slapped my cheek to brace myself, and as I entered the clubroom, leaving the door open.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? I thought it was open.... Hmmn? Someone's already here. Oh, Manaka from the same class, right?&quot;</p>

<p>As all the female students turned their heads to me, Mimori was the only one who blinked her eyes. Well, it's understandable to react like that when the person you wanted to hide, suddenly appears.</p>

<p>&quot;Tch.&quot;, Manaka clicked her tongue lightly and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Another loner, huh... We're using this place now. Can't you just give up on it?&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, that's right. But I can't just back down here because it would mean leaving Mimori behind.</p>

<p>However, since we have to keep our relationship secret, I can't blatantly protect her. I need to find a way to handle this while pretending to be strangers... But I think it'll be okay.</p>

<p>Because Manaka dislikes Mimori, there's a chance that I can carefully resolve this problem by choosing right words.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. My bad, my bad. I'll change the location then.... But isn't this surprising.&quot; I casually murmured the words. &quot;I never expected you to be having lunch with Mimori-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?! Who would have a meal with this bitch? Being with this bitch only would ruin my virginity!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? I thought it was that kind of relationship since you were here in this place together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up! I have my own reasons! Fine, everyone, let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>Seemingly not wanting to be seen as close with Mimori, Manaka take her friends and leave.</p>

<p>That's good. When anyone sees Manaka having conversations with Mimori, who she hates the most. And got misunderstood being close with her. The only way to resolve that is to quickly leave.</p>

<p>Before Manaka leaves, she glared at me and said, &quot;I'm telling you, don't tell anyone that I met Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, don't worry. I don't have many friends to share that kind of information with.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if I'm disliked... Well, it's fine. I'm already used to girls find me annoying anyways. (story from my middle school.)</p>

<p>Now that it was just the two of us, Mimori remained expressionless and didn't say anything. Considering that Manaka and her friends is still around, Mimori can't afford to be around me, since it's gonna ruin my highschool life.</p>

<p>Without exchanging any parting words, we both left the room.</p>

<p>I thought, I was just being too meddlesome for no reason... But my phone suddenly vibrated.</p>

<p>Curiously, I picked it up and saw a message from Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, you're too reckless. But thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haha.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but to smile when I read it.</p>

<p>&quot;You're welcome.&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>I wonder if I managed to act somewhat like a boyfriend... No, I'm probably just getting too carried away again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the closing ceremony, while I was getting ready to go home, my homeroom teacher called out to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Tokami-kun. Can you come to the disciplinary room later? It seems like someone wants to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Uh, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I don't remember doing anything that would make me called by teacher though. The only recent event I can think of is meeting Mimori, but there's no way that's related, right?</p>

<p>Well, Mimori is famous troublemaker, but nobody knows that we're dating, so it couldn't be about that.</p>

<p>As I pondered over it, walking down the hallway, I suddenly stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>Through the window, I could see the courtyard where Mimori had search her phone before. And there, right at that moment, I saw Mimori trying to head home.</p>

<p>But why is she crossing through the courtyard? She could just go straight to the school gate... Ah, I see. She probably wants to avoid attracting too much attention, so she's taking a detour. Mimori is tired of being looked at because she's too famous in a strange way.</p>

<p>I kinda want to call out and wave my hand to her, but I promised to act like a stranger. So, I at least watched her until she disappeared from my sight and started walking again.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, it's Tokami.&quot;</p>

<p>I knocked on the door upon entering the room, and then stood there, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>I assumed that since it was the disciplinary room, it would be a teacher I was meeting, but inside was a senior girl wearing a emblem of a third-year student.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome. It's nice to meet you, I suppose? ... I'm Kurusu Ruka, the disciplinary committee chair.&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice was clear and crisp, like a sound of a rolling bell.</p>

<p>Her black hair, flowing down to her waist, was silky smooth. Her slightly upturned, cat-like eyes gave off a sharp and cunning impression, and her skin was so beautiful that it resembled somewhat like fresh snow. Even sitting in a chair, her outstanding figure was evident, and she was such a stunning girl that I couldn't help but be captivated by her beauty.</p>

<p>So, this person, Kurusu Ruka, was the one who called me here.</p>

<p>But wait, did she just say she's the disciplinary committee chair? Come to think of it, Suzune mentioned before that Mimori often receives guidance from the disciplinary committee.... Could it be?</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Kurusu-san, is it? Was the disciplinary committee has something to discuss with me...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I wanted to talk to you about something. It's a secret conversation that I don't want anyone else to overhear.&quot;</p>

<p>She had a mysterious smile that seemed already delve into the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you're dating Mimori Yui, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it didn't take long for it to be revealed.</p>

<p>The time attack to see how quickly our relationship would be exposed, is already exposed within less than a day. It's a record-breaking time that could aim a world record. However, I'm not at-least happy with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori Yui? Is she part of my class? I don't know her well since we haven't talked much.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh no, oh no, oh no...! Can I bluff my way through this? Where did the information about us dating leaked, in the first place anyway...? While maintaining my fake calm expression, I felt a sense of panic inside. Then, Kurusu-san chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Good good, that you can keep it a secret. I can't trust someone who confesses immediately after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by trust? I don't really understand what you're talking about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm on your side too. So, you can tell me the truth, it's okay... I know Yui as well.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Really?&quot;</p>

<p>The tension immediately escaped from my body.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Mimori and I are dating...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard it from Yui. I was surprised, you know? After the day she said that she's interested in someone, she confessed immediately. It's just like her, in a way.&quot;</p>

<p>I see... Wait, no.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on a second. Is that really true? Because you're in disciplinary committee right? And Mimori is, well... you know, she's famous for those rumors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What rumors? I won't understand unless you tell me properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I firmly refuse. Mimori is my girlfriend, after all. I don't want to use words that will criticize her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, you're a sincere person. I apologize, if I offended you. It was just a joke.&quot;</p>

<p>A joke, huh? Despite being the disciplinary committee chair, she's surprisingly casual.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, as someone responsible for maintaining discipline, crossing the line with multiple underage students shouldn't be overlooked. But I just can't bring myself to think that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, because Yui is a good person, isn't she? I don't believe the rumors going around about her.&quot;</p>

<p>Her words were so calmly spoken that I was taken aback.</p>

<p>Kurusu-san is the first person in this school who has been on Mimori's side.</p>

<p>&quot;So, I wanted to confirm what kind of guy you are, since Yui often gets approached by guys with ulterior motives.&quot;</p>

<p>As she spoke, Kurusu-san crossed her legs. I caught a glimpse of her pure white thigh and instinctively averted my gaze. Mimori already made numerous attempts to me, but I still feel uncomfortable in a situations like this.</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Uh, then what was the reason for calling me out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted to meet you once, Tokami-kun. And in this room, no one will overhear us, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was a very personal reason... Is it really okay for you to use your authority to call me out like this? It seems like an abuse of power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine as long as we don't get caught.&quot;</p>

<p>Is she really the disciplinary committee chair?</p>

<p>&quot;I understand that there are risks involved in dating Yui. Even between Yui and me, we have a rule of pretending to be strangers at school. But I am on your relationship side. If there's anything I can do, I want to cooperate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cooperate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Yui has found a boyfriend, right? It's natural for me to want to support her as an acquaintance. So, in a way... I suppose you can call me a love cupid who will moderate You and Yui together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Don't you feel embarrassed saying that yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san chuckled softly and said, &quot;....I'm feeling a bit regretful now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I appreciate your concern for Mimori, but you're misunderstanding something. I'm not dating Mimori because I have feelings for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yui said the same thing. She said the confession was only 50% successful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I still think it's strange to be in a relationship like that with someone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think so. It may sound clich&eacute;, but it's possible to develop feelings for someone after starting a relationship. Besides, personally, I quite like you, Tokami-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san's gaze was as sharp as a Japanese sword.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00011.jpeg">

<p>&quot;Well, if you know about those rumors, it's not something normal to consider dating her... So, does that mean you don't believe the rumors about her?&quot; Kurusu asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know honestly. Mimori neither denies nor confirms the rumors. What I know for sure is that, I want to believe that in her, that she is not the kind of person who would do such things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not believing but wanting to believe, huh? What if the rumors are true, and Yui betrays you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would just be disappointed in my lack of judgment when it comes to the opposite sex.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, I see. You're determined enough to be in a relationship with her.&quot;</p>

<p>As Kurusu-san said that, she seemed somewhat amused.</p>

<p>&quot;There's something I want to ask you too, Kurusu-san. Do you think the rumors about Mimori are true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, personally... I think most of them are just made-up stories.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most of them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As an disciplinary committee member, I investigated, and I couldn't confirm any student who had engaged in sexual activities with Mimori. Most likely, it's just a rumor that has gotten out of hand, and there is no factual basis to support the claims of her being promiscuous... You're looking away though, are you possibly embarrassed?&quot;</p>

<p>Geez, don't point it out. I'm not used to this kind of conversation, not much like Suzune though.</p>

<p>&quot;However, even though I can't confidently say that everything is a lie, that mainly happens because Yui doesn't deny the rumors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yui seems to reject their invitation by saying she's &quot;not in the mood.&quot;... Also I wonder why Yui doesn't outright deny the rumors, stating that they are lies from the start.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't find the words to respond. I never expected Mimori to handle rejections in such a way.</p>

<p>However, the fact that the way she rejects the guys and evading my question... It suggests that there might be a reason why she can't deny the rumors.</p>

<p>...No, it's not like Mimori is keeping secrets or anything, not now.</p>

<p>Perhaps some parts of the rumors might be true. That's why I'm in a relationship with Mimori, because I believe that.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori's bad reputation still exist because she doesn't deny the rumors. Until we find out the exact reason for that, I can't say she's innocent. However, if there's one thing I can assert, it's that Mimori is a kind-hearted girl.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san chuckled.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I'm congratulating you, Tokami-kun. In Mimori's case, a genuine sincere guy like you might be the best fit for her. You two look quite good together, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...When you put it that way, it's quite complicated for me. I probably can't develop feelings for Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, being in a relationship with Mimori is nothing more than my own selfishness.</p>

<p>I want Mimori to be a normal girl. That's why I'm in a relationship with her, even though I don't have romantic feelings for her.</p>

<p>&quot;Come to think of it, Yui said something like that, didn't she? If that's the case, it's a shame. Personally, I'm rooting for Yui's love... But you, I feel like you could make Yui happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, Kurusu-san smiled subtly.</p>

<p>Kurusu Ruka, huh? It's quite a strange coincidence that Mimori's only acquaintance is the disciplinary committee chair.</p>

<p><p>&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>A few days after Mimori and I started dating.</p>

<p>From the perspective of others, I must be like usual at school and Mimori's camouflage for hiding was throughly invisible; she's not having conversations with me, we didn't even make eye contact when passing each other. The other students around us probably never even dreamed that Mimori and I were dating.</p>

<p>However, beneath the surface, my life had changed dramatically.</p>

<p>For example, Mimori would always send me a &quot;good morning&quot; message every morning, and we would have casual chats like, &quot;Riku-kun, do you have any favorite music?&quot; in the evenings.</p>

<p>And today, she invited me to her house, saying, &quot;Why don't you come over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>After school, I think I have a troubled expression as I waited for the train in the platform.</p>

<p>I can't help but feel to nervous. Visiting her house all of a sudden feels like skipping several steps.</p>

<p>But there's no other choice. If we want to have a proper conversation, we have to find a place where we can be alone without attracting attention.</p>

<p>...Well, maybe I was just getting too nervous.</p>

<p>Suddenly, someone tapped my shoulder from behind, causing me to flinch. And as I turned around, something light touched my cheek.</p>

<p>And Suzune was there, poking my cheek with her index finger, looking bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, was the surprise a big success?&quot;</p>

<p>...Huh. Is this the prank where you poke the cheek of the person who turned around and go, 'Gotcha!'?</p>

<p>&quot;What's up, Suzune? Are you heading home now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I just happened to see you, Senpai, so I thought I'd play a little prank. But since you were surprised when I tapped your shoulder, I don't feel much of a sense of accomplishment...&quot;</p>

<p>Well, we're both in the after-school club and live nearby, so we do bump each other at the station sometimes. But to meet each other at this timing when I'm about to go to Mimori's house is kinda....</p>

<p>But soon, the train arrived and naturally, Suzune boarded the train.</p>

<p>&quot;Senpai, what's wrong? The train is leaving, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Today, I'm planning to take a different train.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's a game I want, but it's an old title, so no matter how many places I search, I can't find it. So I thought of going a little further to a big city to look for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...?&quot; Suzune stared at me intently, as if she think something's weird happening.</p>

<p>Oi, oi, oi! Are you serious? Can you figure it out just from that...!?</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I guess there's no helping it. Oh! By the way, I haven't decided on a Father's Day gift yet. Can you help me choose when we have time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sure. That's totally fine. Well then, see you later.&quot;</p>

<p>Damn... Come to think of it, I've known Suzune since middle school. She's a Kouhai who knows me the most, so it's not surprising if she noticed some subtle changes.</p>

<p>Afterward, I boarded the train and got off at my intended station. I opened the map app, searched for the address I previously asked, and walked. After a few minutes after leaving the station... Eventually, I stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>&quot;...Are we really meeting here?&quot;</p>

<p>The place I arrived at was a luxurious-looking apartment.</p>

<p>I dialed Mimori's apartment number on the intercom in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, it's Tokami.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What's the passphrase?&quot;</p>

<p>Is she serious?</p>

<p>But the door opened quickly and it seems like Mimori is just joking. It was my first time seeing an auto-lock system. From the perspective of a commoner like me, I even felt a bit unsure if I should really enter.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and used the elevator to go up to Mimori's apartment.</p>

<p>I pressed the intercom button, after a while, Mimori greeted me with her casual clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome. Hehe... It feels strange to meet outside of school, doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it does...&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but feel a bit flustered seeing her in casual clothes. It just adds a sense of specialness when it's not the usual school uniform.</p>

<p>I entered the apartment that was led to the living room.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's quite troublesome that we can't even talk unless we're at your place. Are you sure this is okay, Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do feel a bit lonely, but it can't be helped. We have to be super protective in our secret. By the way, no one followed you here, right? It would be a big problem if we get discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>Am I starting to look like a cheating man who secretly meets his mistress?</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think so, but... You said you're not worried about meeting your parents, but are you really okay? If they happen to come back home and see me here, you might get into trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, you should be fine. I live alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're living separately from your parents? You did not mention that before.&quot;</p>

<p>I had no idea. This is completely new discovery.</p>

<p>So that means Mimori and I will be alone together all this time? I hope I can handle it...</p>

<p>&quot;But living alone in this luxurious apartment is pretty impressive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like I needed such a fancy place, though.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori let out a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;People at school have this weird misunderstanding that I'm rich because they found out I live alone. Just because my dad covers the rent doesn't mean I'm wealthy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori is rich...? It feels like I've heard that somewhere before.&quot;</p>

<p>'&#9472;&#9472;There's a rumor that Mimori is incredibly wealthy for a high school student, and it's because she receives pocket money from some unknown guy.'</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Suzune mentioned something like that... Wait a minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then what about 'Sugar daddy'...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sugar daddy?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori looked puzzled, and I waved my hand, saying, &quot;Never mind, forget I said anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, I see. So rumors can also be born out of these kinds of misunderstandings.</p>

<p>At the same time, I felt relieved.</p>

<p>After all, indeed there are some baseless rumors about Mimori. If that's the case, Mimori might be the kind of girl I want to believe in.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, you have quite a smirk on your face. Did I say something funny?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not in a bad way. I just got a little happy, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>As I looked around the living room again, I noticed a pile of clothes on the floor. It seems like Mimori was in the middle of the laundry.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you wait a moment? I'll tidy up the things right away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a problem, but... um, can I ask one thing? There are no underwear or anything in the laundry, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want to see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm asking because it would be rude to you if I saw it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it. I've already put it away.&quot;</p>

<p>That's good then, I thought, and sat on the cushion that Mimori had laid out for me.</p>

<p>Then, Mimori moved the pile of laundry and sat right beside me, folding the clothes. We were in such close proximity that our skin touched.</p>

<p>&quot;... Mimori-san. Isn't this getting a little too close?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Well, I haven't seen Riku-kun at all today. My Riku energy is already lacking, so I need to replenish it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. So, how exactly do you replenish that 'Riku energy'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By getting affectionate with Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>I see... well, I guess there's no helping it.</p>

<p>That's absolutely not happening. It's embarrassing, and I'd prefer if she stayed away.</p>

<p>...But I'm hesitating to move away from her. Mimori is pretending to be someone else at school just to protect my reputation. Because of that, I want to let Mimori have her way a little bit, just now.</p>

<p>&quot;You're good at this. Your cooking was delicious too. You're quite skilled at these things.&quot; As Mimori swiftly folds the laundry.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to do everything myself in my daily life. Just having you around is quite refreshing. I usually do all the housework alone.&quot;</p>

<p>I genuinely think it's amazing. Being a high school student like me and being so responsible.</p>

<p>That's why it's somewhat frustrating when the students around us label Mimori as a slut. Mimori is more independent than any of our classmates.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori, you would make a great wife, I'm sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does that mean you will become my husband?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but lower my head in embarrassment.</p>

<p>That was my fault. I was so careless using the word 'wife'.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori, aren't you playing too much around me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just find it fun to see how innocent your reactions are. This is my way of showing affection.&quot;</p>

<p>It's a mischievous form of love... But honestly, it's frustrating to be toyed like this.</p>

<p>But the truth is, I have prepared a plan to get back at Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for the sudden question, but can you say 'heatstroke' slowly?&quot; (TL: &#29105;&#20013;&#30151; 'Netsuchushou')</p>

<p>&quot;...Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Please, don't realize it. Just say it as it is...! Mimori, who's tilting her head slightly, says,</p>

<p>&quot;Ne, chuu, shiyou?&quot; &#12300;&#12397;&#12387;&#12289;&#12385;&#12421;&#12540;&#12375;&#12424;&#65311;&#12301;  (TL: &quot;Hey, should we kiss?&quot;)</p>

<p>Gotcha!</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, do you even realize what you just said?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, it seems like you don't. Listen, Mimori. By saying 'heatstroke' slowly, you ended up saying an embarrassing word&mdash;'kiss'!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I said it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Should we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...No, we shouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>Damn it, it's not working at all!</p>

<p>Mimori giggles softly and says,</p>

<p>&quot;I see, that's too bad. But you're already my boyfriend, so it's fine for you to treat me as you like. Whether you're in love or not, just come to me, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>With a proximity close enough to feel our body heat, Mimori smiles.</p>

<p>&quot;For example, if you wanted to touch my chest...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's also a joke, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About half of it. But if you really wishes for it, you're free to do as you please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I decline. As someone who isn't in love with you, I don't have that right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm. Riku-kun, you have some peculiar principles.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, considering I've never had a romantic relationship before, I can be bit twisted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, how far is acceptable for you? For example, what about my hair?&quot;</p>

<p>I find myself staring at Mimori. Her hair has a pleasant aroma, like scent of citrus, and it flows smoothly.</p>

<p>&quot;...That might be a little embarrassing too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, then... what about my upper arms?&quot;</p>

<p>Confused by the mention of upper arms, I tilt my head. Mimori rolls up her sleeves and says,</p>

<p>&quot;I actually enjoy having my upper arms getting touched. If the chest and hair are off-limits, maybe the upper arms would be okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if it's just that... Wait, isn't this strange? When did the conversation assume that I would touch you? What's going on? Is this some kind of leading interrogation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was just curious about how much you would trust me. It's a bit lonely when you never initiate any physical contact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you put it that way, it's fine, but... I mean, it's just the upper arms, right?&quot;</p>

<p>As I say that, I gently squeeze and knead Mimori's white upper arms.</p>

<p>Hmm, they're soft. Her skin is smooth, and the flesh has a pleasant plumpness. It feels so comfortable and satisfying that I can't help but get addicted while touching them.</p>

<p>I use my fingers to pinch and cover her upper arms with the palm of my hand.</p>

<p>...Oh no, I'm starting to feel a little strange doing this. But well, it's just the upper arms, right? There's no need to feel embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>&quot;So, are they soft?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... Yeah, they are. I'm actually quite surprised by how this feels. It's my first time experiencing this texture from a girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... By the way, though.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori says with a mischievous smile still on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;The sensation of the upper arms is said to be the same as the chest.&quot;</p>

<p>*Squeeze.*</p>

<p>While still holding Mimori's upper arms, I froze as if I turned into a statue.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm saying that, right now, you're essentially touching my chest. Considering that, let me ask again... How soft is it?&quot;</p>

<p>For a brief moment, my mind went blank.</p>

<p>*Bam!*</p>

<p>I quickly released her arms. However, the sensation of their softness still lingered in my palm, and my face flushed as my heart started racing violently.</p>

<p>&quot;T-T-That's... There's no way that's true! What kind of nonsensical theory is that? It doesn't make any sense!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's just a popular belief. But I did compare it by touching myself, and it seemed quite similar.&quot; Then she smiled and laugh. Hahaha. Riku-kun, you look so flustered.&quot;</p>

<p>As if being drawn in, my gaze involuntarily shifted towards Mimori's chest. Is it really the same as what I just touched...?</p>

<p>&quot;Or maybe... you want to touch it for real and find out?&quot;</p>

<p>I was on the verge of complete thought shutdown.</p>

<p>My embarrassment reached its limit, and while still seated, I started to back away... Immediately after, my field of vision made a 90-degree rotation.</p>

<p>There was a pile of laundry where I placed my hand, causing me to slip and lose my balance.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... Wooaah!&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori hurriedly grabbed my hand, but our weight was completely off. I ended up being pinned down by Mimori as we fell together.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was a pile of laundry where we fell. Although there was impact, there was no pain.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry, Mimori. Are you alright?&quot;</p>

<p>I swallowed hard.</p>

<p>In front of me was Mimori, looking down at me as if covering me. Her face was flushed with embarrassment... And in my left hand, I felt something soft.</p>

<p>I realized that I had accidentally touched Mimori's chest.</p>

<p>A surge of electricity seemed to run through my entire body. I quickly let go of Mimori's chest and jumped up.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm so sorry! I just instinctively reached out my hand when I fell, I didn't mean any harm! I... I don't even know how to apologize, but I'm really sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>However, Mimori remained silent, holding her chest with both arms. Her eyes are trembling, and her cheeks were dyed crimson. It was a maiden-like expression on Mimori's face that I had never seen before.</p>

<p>I couldn't stop feeling regret. I desperately searched for words to apologize... But what was I thinking?</p>

<p>Suddenly, Mimori reached into her clothes and rummaged around, searching for something. Eventually, she took something out from her clothes.</p>

<p>In her hand was a towel.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it should be fine... I had a towel placed on top of my chest as a cushion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um... Actually, I prepared this towel before you arrived. I even thought of the question, 'Would you like to touch my chest?' beforehand. And if you did touch it, I planned to reveal it as a 'Disappointing Towel' joke... But...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, what did I touch then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It became the towel, I guess. At least, that was my intention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What? Seriously! I'm glad I didn't touch it!&quot;</p>

<p>But it did feel soft, although it felt completely different from the sensation of the upper arms. Was that because of the towel?</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really relieved. It would have been unlucky accidentally touch your chest.... Mimori? What's wrong, Mimori? You've been acting strange since earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah, ahaha. Well, you see...&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori blushes shyly.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't expect this kind of accident. I actually thought that you might touch it for real.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? so, you're planning on resisting in it too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that. I wouldn't mind if it were you, Riku-kun, but I still needed some mental preparation... I've been feeling nervous this whole time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Okay, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>I averted my gaze from Mimori. If I didn't, I'm sure she would have noticed that even my face also turned red.</p>

<p>Mimori blushed shyly, and it was an expression that didn't match the mischievous girl who had been playing with me just a moment ago. It was so cute that my heart couldn't help but to pound loudly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before heading home, we chatted casually and decided to have dinner, of course made by Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, bye-bye. It was nice to be able to spend time leisurely with you today. Normally, I wouldn't even try to make eye contact with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry about that. You probably wanted to have normal conversations at school too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. It was me who suggested hiding our relationship, ...But if you're okay with it, can I make a bento for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...A bento?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to have some connection with you at school, even if it's just a little. Besides, it would give me a reason to come to your house and retrieve the lunchbox.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that your true objective?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Both... Is it bothersome?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all. I like Mimori's cooking, and if it means more food, I'll be grateful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, ....Maybe I've found another hobby.&quot; With a gentle smile on Mimori's face, I left the apartment.</p>

<p>On the way home, I found myself thinking absentmindedly about the girl named Mimori. Lately, whenever I'm alone and thinking, it always revolves around that girl.</p>

<p>I think Mimori probably genuinely likes me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I haven't really lived up to Mimori's expectations. I think she's a good person, but my feelings for her are probably different from romantic feelings.</p>

<p>...That's why I feel guilty for hurting Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;It must be suffocating for her.&quot;</p>

<p>From Mimori's perspective, our current relationship is too restrictive.</p>

<p>We pretend to be strangers at school, and we can only meet in places where we can be alone outside of school. That's why I think she teases me so much. She wants to cherish any time she can to spend with me.</p>

<p>There's a part of me that wants to somehow fulfill her sincere will.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do for Mimori?</p>

<p>&quot;But even if I say that, there are too many limitations between us...&quot;</p>

<p>For example, even if I want to go out somewhere together, we've both agreed not to go out as a couple. If there's even a slight risk of being seen by other students, Mimori would refuse...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, an idea comes to mind.</p>

<p>If I could somehow ask the help of the only person who claims to be Mimori's ally&mdash;Kurusu-san&mdash;maybe things could work out.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I talk to you for a moment? I have something to discuss about Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>I took out my smartphone and sent a message to Kurusu-san. It was fortunate that we exchanged contact information when we first met.</p>

<p>Within five minutes, I received a reply saying, &quot;Is it my turn?&quot;</p>

<p>Hesitation arose, and my finger stopped.</p>

<p>However, it was only for a moment. I made up my mind and decided to continue it.</p>

<p>&quot;What would you think if I said, I want to go on a date with Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a sunny sunday morning, many people were bustling around me. This is because this area where I am right now, was famous beach tourist spot, with attractions such as a Ferris wheel and cruise ships, as well as large-scale facilities. It's always crowded on weekends.</p>

<p>Normally, with this place with has enormous &quot;riajuu aura,&quot; I wouldn't even dare to come, but this time was different.</p>

<p>After all, today...</p>

<p>&quot;It's a beautiful day. Perfect for a date, wouldn't you say?&quot;</p>

<p>At the meeting place, Kurusu-san, dressed in mature casual clothes, said with a hint of elegance.</p>

<p>There was still about fifteen minutes until the appointed time, so Mimori would arrive little early.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm grateful to you, Kurusu-san. Thanks to you, I can meet Mimori even outside of school... That's the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't hide my anxiety and found myself looking around nervously.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really sure with me being with Mimori Yui's claimant for deepening communication as part of the disciplinary committee's activities? I feel like it would be bad if other students saw us.&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Facilitating communication between students who aren't familiar with each other is one of the responsibilities of the disciplinary committee. That's why I specifically requested through the student council that you and Yui would participate in recreational activities together.&quot; Kurusu-san's said with confidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Just rest assured, even if students see you, you can just use the excuse that you were asked by the disciplinary committee, and it can't be helped... But more importantly, I'm curious about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Curious about me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tokami-kun, you were at the meeting place quite early, weren't you? Do you know the term 'premature,' by any chance?&quot;</p>

<p>The teachers, Kurusu-san, are the one's who's disrupting the regulation. By the way, she's the head of the disciplinary committee.</p>

<p>&quot;...Please understand that this kind of situation is new to me. I occasionally spend time with my Kouhai after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're nervous, aren't you? I suppose you're doing your best in your own way, Tokami-kun, ...But it's a bit surprising. You said you would never develop feelings for Yui.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My mind is still the same. I just want her to have a little fun, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, there's no need to worry about anything.</p>

<p>The reason I'm dating her is that I want her to be like a normal girl you can found anywhere. That's all.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning...&quot;</p>

<p>When I turned around, Mimori was there, wearing a complicated expression. She had a shoulder-dropping outerwear over her sleeveless knit. The black miniskirt suited her, and I was at a loss for words seeing her in a different appearance than usual.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, it's been a while since we had a conversation like this outside, remembering the time when we first met.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah. Good morning. Um, where should we start first?&quot; I asked nervously.</p>

<p>&quot;Before that, could you stay still for a moment?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori rummaged through her bag and took out pitch-black sunglasses. She put them on me and then handed me a mask. Finally, she put a knit cap on my head, nodded in satisfaction, and said, &quot;Great. Now, shall we go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great? I'm not so sure. Are we going to rob a bank or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Because if we don't do something like this, you'll be exposed, right? If someone we know sees us--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry, even if we're caught, I'll protect you,&quot; And she got interrupted by Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, Tokami-kun and I can't go out together frequently from now on. That's why I chose this spot, knowing the risks of being seen. You don't have to think about anything, Yui.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...As expected, Ruka. It's reassuring to have the Disciplinary Committee chair around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is the power of authority.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori chuckled at Kurusu-san's words.</p>

<p>I watched that scene with a strange feeling. Come to think of it, it was the first time I'd seen Mimori talking and having fun with someone other than me.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, you two are friends, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah. Although we only communicate through our phones, and we've only hung out like this a few times. But she's undoubtedly the student I get along with the best at school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I feel bad for Yui. Both of you can't contact with each other at school.&quot;</p>

<p>I see, Kurusu-san felt the same way as I did.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then... Riku-kun, nice to meet you again. It's our first date, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Likewise.&quot;</p>

<p>...Why am I getting flustered though?</p>

<p>Upon Mimori's request, we decided to go to a clothing store inside the shopping mall. It's already July, so it might be the perfect time to buy summer clothes.</p>

<p>But I thought Mimori would be the type to spend a considerable amount of money on fashion...</p>

<p>&quot;Surprisingly reasonable... I thought the cool kids in our class would be buying more expensive clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>As a fan of a certain clothing brand, I imagined the store to be like a different world.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that. High school students have limited money to spend.&quot;</p>

<p>With a nonchalant expression, Mimori looked at the clothes in the shop.</p>

<p>&quot;People who love fashion are good at styling low-priced trends. I also prefer thinking about how to create outfits while keeping the expenses down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... But there are quite expensive clothes too. This T-shirt, for example, costs 6000 yen.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, Shim&#9675;ra is the most comfortable for me. It's cheap, and it's available everywhere. (TL: I don't know what's that Shim&#9675;ra brand, I tried researching about famous brands in japan but it didn't appear. Let me know as correction thou.)</p>

<p>Just then, Kurusu-san chimed in,</p>

<p>&quot;...Is it expensive? If a T-shirt costs 6000 yen, I think it's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Wait, fine...? With 6000 yen, you could do 20 consecutive gacha pulls!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But in other stores, they cost around 20,000 yen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?! Are you kidding me? With that much, you could do 60 consecutive gacha pulls...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why's your remarks all about mobile games?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, from my perspective, whether I can do a paid gacha once a year or not is the deciding factor. I don't have the courage to spend such precious pocket money on clothes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's a game you can play on your smartphone, right? Riku-kun, do you like it?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori asked with an upward glance. Maybe she doesn't know much about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I play it quite a bit. It's nice to have some free games available on your phone after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's free. Then later, could you teach me the game you like, Riku-kun?&quot; Mimori smiled softly. &quot;If I do that, we can have more conversations and play together right? It might be really hard for me at first, but I want to give it a try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... for the sake of your boyfriend, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san grinned. What's with that face, saying, 'Yes, I've been enchanted you with her' thing?</p>

<p>After going around the stores separately, Mimori held a few pieces of clothing close to her chest.</p>

<p>&quot;This should be enough. I want to try them on, so Riku-kun, will you come with me? I want to know the kind of outfits your type.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, sure. I'm also interested in seeing what suits you, Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, is the critical moment.</p>

<p>I expected that we would end up seeing the fitting room as soon as we entered the clothing store.</p>

<p>I absolutely don't see Mimori as the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Mimori enters the fitting room. Come to think of it, where did Kurusu-san go? I look around, but there's no sign of her. She must have escaped, being considerate...</p>

<p>Eventually, the curtain opens, and Mimori smiles wearing a pure white dress.</p>

<p>&quot;How does this look? It's a bit pricey though.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, she looks great in it.</p>

<p>It's not about the sense of fashion or anything like that. But Mimori in a dress is so angelic that you can't help but to admire.... However,</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I think it's good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? ...If you say so, I'll go ahead and buy it without hesitation.&quot;</p>

<p>I casually reply, and Mimori closes the curtain.</p>

<p>Alright, how was it? I'm sure my face didn't show anything.</p>

<p>I've been caught off guard by Mimori many times, but if I tighten my focus, I can endure it too. When I'm starting to feel a glimmer of confidence, Mimori peeks her face out from behind the curtain.</p>

<p>&quot;...? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just checking around. I don't want any men other than you around.&quot;</p>

<p>What do you mean? Before I could say anything, the curtain opens, and for a moment, and I forget to breathe.</p>

<p>Mimori is there in a swimsuit.</p>

<p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How is it? ...Does it to suit me?&quot;</p>

<p>This is going too far for a surprise attack.</p>

<p>It's a bikini, yet the lower part is adorned with frills, giving it a cute design. The cleavage is clearly visible, and her white thighs look so soft that I want to feel them with my fingers. Everything I see is stimulating, and I find myself wanting to keep looking at her forever.</p>

<p>What a foolish thought. Why would there be a swimsuit in a regular clothing store anyway...? Then, I suddenly realize.</p>

<p>It must be because of the summer fair.</p>

<p>It's not surprising to have swimsuits available during this time of the year when they are promoting summer products. And she brought me into this fitting room just to show me her in a swimsuit.</p>

<p>&quot;...He-hee&mdash;. It looks great on you.&quot;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00012.jpeg">

<p>&quot;I want you to say those words while properly looking at me.&quot;</p>

<p>With a quick glance, Mimori is not making any effort to hide her body while smiling. It's amazing how she doesn't feel self-conscious in that kind of outfit.</p>

<p>&quot;I choose this swimsuit just because I want to hear your opinion. Can you look at me? You don't get to see something like this very often, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>I shouldn't feel anything special about Mimori. Why am I getting nervous?</p>

<p>I try to assert that to myself, but I still can't look at Mimori properly. It's unfair, she's just too strong.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that shirt looks nice. Why don't you try it on?&quot; Just then, a male voice comes from nearby.</p>

<p>Mimori hasn't even changed yet. In that moment, I reach out to close the curtain. However, Mimori grabs my hand and pulls me into the fitting room. Before I can react, she closes the curtain.</p>

<p>In other words... we are alone now. And Mimori is in a swimsuit.</p>

<p>&quot;Mi... Mimori?! Why...!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't make any noise, okay? We might get caught by the people outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's smile shows a hint of bashfulness, but she's enjoying this situation.</p>

<p>In the small fitting room, it's inevitable that we end up being close to each other. Just thinking about Mimori's chest being right next to me, causes my mind to go blank and causing my vocabulary to collapse. The impact is too strong, and my ability to articulate is crumbling.</p>

<p>If I avert my gaze, I can see Mimori's clothes neatly folded in the corner. On top of them is a white string-like fabric, probably a bra, and I instinctively turn my face away.</p>

<p>Don't get embarrassed. This is what she plans.</p>

<p>&quot;You're being reckless all of a sudden. If I were an ordinary guy, my rationality might have snapped, and I might have attacked you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, you're not ordinary, Riku-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not in love with you or anything. So I will not lay my hand on you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're stubborn, Riku-kun... But right now, it's fine like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori snuggles up to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad I'm in a swimsuit. When it's against your bare skin, I can feel your warmth so clearly.&quot;</p>

<p>...How can she say words that make me feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? Someone's using the fitting room.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a male voice is heard outside, and both Mimori and I hold our breath.</p>

<p>Please, don't let us be discovered... Gradually, the sound of footsteps moving away reaches our ears, and I let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems like we're safe now... So now, Riku-kun.&quot; Mimori speaks softly with a smile on her face. &quot;I'll ask it once again, does this swimsuit suit me? If you say you like it, I'll seriously consider buying it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm not just saying this to flatter you, but it really suits you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? I'm glad. I actually liked it too.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's innocent smile brightens up.</p>

<p>...I was surprised when Mimori set me up, but well, it's fine. If Mimori is enjoying herself, that's the most important thing.</p>

<p>However, I couldn't let my guard down for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>...That's what I thought, but after that, there were no more surprises or schemes from Mimori. Time passed with me, Mimori, and Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>For example, we had tapioca drinks together.</p>

<p>&quot;...These are quite delicious. The chewy texture makes it so enjoyable to drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not bad, right? But, this trend already ended, and it's your first time trying it, Riku-kun. Weren't you curious to try it before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I never thought something popular among JK would suit to me...&quot; (TL: Joshikousei = Highschool Girls)</p>

<p>&quot;That's just biased, even though both you and I are high school students. By the way, have you heard of the tapioca challenge, Riku-kun?&quot; Mimori asked. (TL: Search 'Tapioca Challenge')</p>

<p>&quot;I know it well, but even though I want to see it, you don't have to do it,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>Another example is, we went to a general goods store together.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori, you've been looking at that cat keychain for a while. Do you like cats?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I quite like them. Cats can be affectionate one moment and then turn away suddenly, right? I like that whimsical aspect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really?...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have a complicated expression though. Are you thinking about buying it for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, are you an esper?&quot; Mimori asked</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to spare your money from me... But it looks like they have a different color variation of this keychain. If you want, shall we buy a pair together?&quot;</p>

<p>...Don't get embarrassed, me. It's just a pair set, nothing to make a big deal about.</p>

<p>For the last, We went on a cruise with Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Ruka. Are you really sure about this? If someone from school sees you taking pictures of us, you won't be able to come up with an excuse, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry, there weren't any high schoolers on the boat. Since you guys were in already, isn't good to have a good time taking pictures with Tokami-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I definitely want to, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's settled. Both of you, come a little closer... Tokami-kun, you have a serious expression.&quot;</p>

<p>It's fine. It's the first photo with Mimori, so don't be nervous. Stay calm, stay calm.</p>

<p>...Since the were no events like this nor Mimori's making any sign of affection, we leisurely enjoyed our time together.</p>

<p>It was such a fulfilling time that I thought the day was too short.</p>

<p>I started to worry if Mimori was actually having fun with someone like me, but Mimori kept smiling the whole time... It's a strange thing to say, but.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but to think, &quot;I'm really on a date with Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> At the plaza, it seemed like there was a festival going on, so we decided to have lunch there.</p>

<p>Apparently, the festival had a theme &quot;sea,&quot; and it seemed like we could eat seafood dishes at the food stalls. The staff members were all wearing sailor uniforms, showing their high level of enthusiasm for the event.</p>

<p>While waiting for the food to be ready, Mimori and I sat at the table. Kurusu-san left her seat to buy drinks.</p>

<p>&quot;We've walked quite a bit this morning. It's been a while since I've done something like this. Having fun with someone, it's probably been since middle school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Mimori hasn't? That's surprising. I had the thought that you'd be pretty good about this kind of event,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that. I don't have any friends to begin with,&quot; Mimori said.</p>

<p>Those words struck a chord with me.</p>

<p>Oh, right. It's true. I forget about it when we're talking like this, but Mimori is isolated at school. There are rumors about her not having any morals.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I'm having so much fun with Riku-kun. I can't remember the last time I laughed this much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I see. I'm glad I invited you then.</p>

<p>After a while, a staff girl brought the food.</p>

<p>&quot;Here it is! Sorry for the wait. It's your order, the seafood sandwich!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yo-soro! Wasn't that a maritime term? It's a festival, so the staff is motivated...&quot;</p>

<p>...Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Somehow, I feel like I recognize this voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's mine. Could you bring it over here, please?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course! Please enjoy your meal at your own pace! And if the customer over there has a numbered ticket, we'll be right with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the staff member stumbled over their words and stared at me. I couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-kun, what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't even respond properly to Mimori's question.</p>

<p>It was only natural for the staff member to be stunned. Because that girl was not just an acquaintance.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly she's my Kouhai, Futaba Suzune?</p>

<p>&quot;...Senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked dumbfounded and was taken aback.</p>

<p>Whether it was the staff uniform or the marine-inspired sailor outfit, I would normally think she's cute with those. But right now, I couldn't afford to have such composure.</p>

<p>Out of all the people I know, why did it have to be Suzune...!</p>

<p>&quot;What a coincidence. I didn't know Suzune was working here.&quot;</p>

<p>As if it were a reflex, Suzune absentmindedly replied,</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Father's Day is coming up soon. I was looking for a part-time job, and I found this festival offering a one-day position...&quot;</p>

<p>'--Alright. Since I'm already here, I'll save up some more money and give it another try!'</p>

<p>She mentioned it before... But still, meeting like this, it's not normal!</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, why are you... with Mimori-san, senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, um...!&quot;</p>

<p>As I wiped away cold sweat and glanced at Mimori, he had a pained expression and remained silent. Indeed, in this situation, it was highly likely that Mimori trying to explain would only give misunderstanding.</p>

<p>If that's the case, I have to do something...!</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune, there's a reason for this&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's part of the disciplinary committee's activities. I apologize if I caused any misunderstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>We turned towards the source of the voice.</p>

<p>It was Kurusu-san, holding a drink. Suzune widened her eyes and exclaimed,</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kurusu-san!? Why is the chairman of disciplinary committee here...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? Suzune, you know her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, of course. Even first-years know about her. She's an excellent disciplinary committee chairperson after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san, with a composed expression, handed drinks to me and Mimori, saying,</p>

<p>&quot;Here you go. At Sakurazaki High School, we organize recreational activities to interact with students who are having difficulty fitting in. Tokami-kun and Mimori-san are participating in those activities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Re... Recreation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have permission from the student council. Here's the approval document.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune gazed at the paper Kurusu-san took and added, &quot;So, senpai and Mimori-san are...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We were randomly chosen. There's no other reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... That's a relief!&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune slumped down.</p>

<p>&quot;Su-suzune?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought my heart would stopped... I-I mean, I thought you and Mimori-san were... Ah, no, never mind! It's nothing, please forget about it!&quot;</p>

<p>...Well, I can understand what Suzune was trying to say.</p>

<p>In short, she misunderstood that I and Mimori were together for that purpose. Considering the rumors about Mimori, it would be natural for her to think that way.</p>

<p>&quot;But wait a moment. If it's a recreational activity, does that mean you'll be together in the afternoon too...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it might turn out that way. We're doing it to foster friendship,&quot; Kurusu-san replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune-san, right? You're Tokami-kun's kouhai? I won't ask what you were worried about, but rest assured. I'll be there as a supervisor by your side,&quot; Kurusu-san assured.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune stared intently at Mimori, who had been silent since earlier. Her expression was unusually stern, indicating that she had something on her mind.</p>

<p>Eventually, she stood up, brushed off the sand from her marine-inspired skirt, and said,</p>

<p>&quot;Um... If it's alright, can I also participate in that recreational activity?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Both Kurusu-san and I got in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Suzune, weren't you working here as a part-time job?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. It will be over soon! However, I have to go out for a family dinner in the evening, so I need to be back home before that late afternoon,&quot; Suzune explained.</p>

<p>&quot;But, you know? This is part of the committee's activities, we're not gonna have fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that! But I want to get to know Mimori-san better! There are various rumors about her, after all...&quot; Suzune expressed her eagerness.</p>

<p>&quot;Is the rumor about the promiscuous? Can you explain it to me specifically?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? ....Um, about doing something naughty with guys...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't hear you clearly. Can you adjust your voice loudly?&quot;</p>

<p>....My pure and undefiled junior is getting contaminated by the disciplinary chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, it's not a good rumor! I haven't been involved with anyone like that before... for the sake of public... public order and decency...&quot; With a low voice.</p>

<p>Perhaps she meant public order and decency...</p>

<p>&quot;For the sake of public... I mean, I want to see what kind of student Mimori-san, the troublemaker, really is!&quot; In the end Suzune couldn't say it clearly.</p>

<p>When I looked at Kurusu-san, she seemed to be giving me a gaze, &quot;What's going on?&quot; Even though encountering someone we know was anticipated, Suzune probably didn't expect me to be with Mimori.</p>

<p>I'm sure she's just worried about me.</p>

<p>For Suzune, Mimori is a troublemaker who sleeps around with anyone. If I were to be tempted by such a girl and end up falling in love and deceived... She probably wants to prevent that from happening by keeping an eye on us.</p>

<p>However, the original purpose was to go on a date with Mimori. But considering the official pretext of it being a committee activity, there was no reason to reject Suzune's wish to participate...</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine with it. If Suzune-chan wants to join, that's okay too.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't believe my ears.</p>

<p>I never expected Mimori to be the first one to accept.</p>

<p>&quot;After all, this activity is for people who have just met to become friends. Is that okay with you too, Tokami-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you says so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's settled. Nice to meet you, Suzune-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Yes. Nice to meet you too.&quot;</p>

<p>Like a small animal, Suzune bowed her head shyly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that, we regroup with Suzune and headed to a store that deals with leather products.</p>

<p>The reason for this is to find Father's Day gift for Suzune's father. Due to Suzune's father's profession, the usual gifts were ties and business card holders but Suzune said he doesn't really used those, so we couldn't decide what to give him. So, I suggested that we all search together.</p>

<p>At first, Suzune hesitated and asked the opinion of the other two, but Mimori and Kurusu-san nodded in agreement, finding it interesting. And so, the four of us are now carefully selecting a gift.</p>

<p>&quot;U-um, hey. Suzune, what about this wallet? I think the pattern is quite nice.&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmm, maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>Because of Suzune's lack of interest reply, our conversation didn't continue onwards.</p>

<p>This group atmosphere were like a family eating in late night family restaurant. (TL: Families eating in family restaurant in japan were silent maybe because their trying to be considerate or probably because of unusual problem in the family.)</p>

<p>Ever since Suzune was added to the group, Mimori has been trying not to talk too much, to not to reveal our relationship. As for Suzune, she seems to be cautious on Mimori or perhaps frightened. It seems like she's more preoccupied with Mimori than in selecting gifts.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is so awkward that even me who has high tolerance, (because of my classmates) felt really uncomfortable in it.</p>

<p>In addition, Suzune also seems uncertain about the Father's Day gift.</p>

<p>&quot;This notepad, cost this...!? It's kind of sad that even though I worked so hard to earn money, yet I can't even buy this...&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, it might have been unreasonable for high schoolers to consider buying leather products.</p>

<p>Then, the disciplinary chair standing next to us muttered quietly, &quot;Is it expensive...?&quot; Don't you have a strange sense of money?</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, we definitely picked the wrong store. Were there any other options?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, how about we split up and search separately? Tokami-kun and Suzune-chan together, and me with Kurusu-san.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone were surprised at the unexpected words from Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;This place is divided into the North Wing and the South Wing, so I think it's easier to search if we split into two groups, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, not a bad idea. Tokami-kun, Suzune-san, let's meet again later, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san nodded as if she understood something and left with Mimori. While we were left behind, we could somehow guess what the two of them were thinking.</p>

<p>Surely, they gave us some time to talk alone together.</p>

<p>Suzune seemed to have realized that as well. She had a somewhat apologetic expression and said, &quot;I made Mimori-san and Kurusu-san worry... I'm sorry. It's because I selfishly said I wanted to go together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a big deal. Maybe it's because you were worried about me?&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune hesitated and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;I often hear from my friends that Mimori-san is a bad person. They say she gets involved with different men and then just discards them. If something like that were to happen to you, Senpai and became friends with her and got deceived, I wouldn't want that to happen.&quot;</p>

<p>I feel happy about her feelings, but it also makes me realize that she doesn't have trust in me... That's what I thought right after.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, in middle school, I've seen senpai getting hurt by girls many times... So when I thought about the possibility of seeing you in that state again because of Mimori-san, I could only think that I have to protect you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>It's not a big deal, really. Many male students have experienced being disliked or annoyed by their female classmates. I'm just one of them.</p>

<p>However, the Kouhai standing in front of me genuinely worries about me.</p>

<p>I can't match Suzune at all, considering she knows everything about my past experience.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought that, I found myself patting Suzune's head.</p>

<p>&quot;...Senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks. Suzune, you're such a good kouhai, even better than I deserve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...S-Stop this already. Please stop patting my head. Things are different from when we were in middle school, so I don't want to be treated like a child.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune turns away, looking embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my bad... But there's one thing I want to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to worry at all about me being deceived by her. I don't think Mimori is not that kind of person, as much as the rumors said about her.</p>

<p>&quot;How... How can you say that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you said you wanted to come with us, Mimori was the first one to accept right? I think she realized that you were worried about me.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori is always afraid that someone will get hurt because of her rumors. That's the exact reason why she's keeping our relationship secret.</p>

<p>She's probably worried just being with me outside.</p>

<p>I think it's because Mimori worried is about about that. That's why she allowed Suzune to come.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know if the rumors about her are true or not. But for me, I think Mimori is a kind person more than you think.&quot; I said to Suzune.</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>However, Suzune could only respond with a hesitant silence.</p>

<p>Well, I guess it can't be helped. It would be difficult to suddenly ask you to believe me.</p>

<p>For about twenty minutes after that, Suzune and I wandered around, looking for a suitable Father's Day gift. Along the way, Suzune asked for my opinion, but I didn't have much confidence in providing helpful suggestions.</p>

<p>We regroup with Mimori and Kurusu-san after, but it seemed they couldn't find anything good either.</p>

<p>&quot;When it comes to something that would make a father happy, maybe alcohol is the only option. There were also wristwatches, but I think they might exceed the budget.&quot; Kurusu-san suggest.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... Suzune, do you know if your father is having any difficulties or anything? If you give him something that can solve that, he might be happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now that you mention it, recently he's been watching Adela&#9675;s commercials with a distant look...&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, you need to leave that alone.</p>

<p>But geez, I wonder if there's anything else... Just when I started to worry about it, Kurusu-san spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I've been thinking. How about you gives him handmade sweets instead?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sweets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a high school student, your parents still sees you as a kid. So instead of spending money, wouldn't it be better to make something with from the heart-effort? I think your father would appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, I see. I didn't think of that. So, what do you think, Senpai? My handmade sweets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune asks me with upturned eyes, and I give my honest opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's a great idea. If your daughter made something handmade for their sake, I'm sure they would be happy. Your parents might even want you to use your earnings from your part-time job for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Yes, I understand! I'll give it a try!&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune is such a good child. If I were her father, I would undoubtedly burst into tears.</p>

<p>&quot;But, I haven't really cooked much before. I'm not sure what kind of sweets to make...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh right, now that I think about it, Mimori is good at cooking, right? She's probably knowledgeable about sweets t&#9472;&#9472;&quot; Suddenly I realize that Mimori and Kurusu-san were staring at me with a dumbfounded expression.</p>

<p>...Isn't it bad if Suzune know how I found out that Mimori is good at cooking?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Mimori was talking about it earlier, how cooking is her hobby!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ahaha, yeah, that's right. Oh, sweets, huh? I also make them occasionally.&quot; Mimori said as if she's backing me up.</p>

<p>As I quickly cover up, Mimori and I are met with a disbelieving gaze from Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>And Suzune looked at Mimori with a surprised expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori-san, you can cook...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah. I live alone, so... Is it surprising?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's just...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no wonder you're surprised. The rumors about me are nothing good. It's not something you would expect from a girl like me who is surrounded by such rumors.&quot;</p>

<p>She always had that innocent smile on her face in front of me.</p>

<p>&quot;I think handmade sweets are a wonderful gift. If you're not used to cooking, I recommend beginner-friendly butter cookies or something like that... Good luck.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune was left dumbfounded.</p>

<p>I understand Suzune's feelings. Mimori Yui is supposed to be a girl disliked by everyone, and that's why she probably never expected to be encouraged so genuinely.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Suzune looks at the clock. I remember that she was supposed to go home in the evening. There's not much time left... Suzune tightly grabs the hem of her skirt and,</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Mimori-san. Can we talk for a moment? Just the two of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;....Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Today, I was so nervous and couldn't talk to you at all. I wanted to have a proper conversation before we part ways...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's fine, really. Getting involved with me would only make you regret it, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't fine. Suzune-san wants it, so why not accompany her for a little chat? Suzune-san seems to have an interest in you.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon Kurusu-san's words, Suzune nods repeatedly. Mimori, with a hesitant expression, meets Suzune's sincere gaze...</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, then, just for a little while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Thank you so much! Um, how about we chat while eating something sweet? I found a delicious crepe shop with my friends the other day!&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune must be nervous. She clings to Mimori's arm, pulling her along as if they were close friends.</p>

<p>Kurusu-san chuckles softly and says, &quot;Suzune-san is an interesting girl. ...What's wrong, Tokami-kun? Your cheeks seems to have loosened up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh, no.&quot;</p>

<p>As I watch the two of them getting smaller in the distance, I mutter to myself.</p>

<p>&quot;It's because Suzune is the first one to try facing Mimori, even if it's just a little, ...I just thought she's my prideful kouhai, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until Mimori and Suzune come back, we decided to wait.</p>

<p>I bought two drinks for both of us.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting. Kurusu-san, you wanted a milkshake, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thank you. But you didn't have to treat me. Tokami-kun, you don't have much money, do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've been helpful all this time, like you're not interrupting us on our conversation and you were considerate in various things today, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It goes both ways. I enjoyed seeing the lovey-dovey Yui and the innocent Tokami-kun. It made things progress in various ways. Thank you for the treat.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, let's not ask what progress.</p>

<p>&quot;But in the end, Tokami-kun, you didn't make any moves, did you? I heard you we're inexperienced in love, but I didn't expect you to be so timid. Normally, when a girl makes such moves, a guy would also respond. It's a shame for a you to let such an opportunity slip by, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man who selfishly enjoys a girl without considering her feelings is much more shameful, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have a point... If other guys saw you, they would be insanely jealous, you know? You've got a lover who loves flirtatious conversation and seduces you everytime after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Flirtatious conversation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you say something like, 'Milk'shakes sound erotic, don't they?&quot;</p>

<p>That's just a sexual harassment creep.</p>

<p>Also, when I talk to Kurusu-san, I forget the concept of discipline. What is discipline, anyway?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if that's what you wants, I don't mind. Yui has become brighter since she started dating you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brighter? Wasn't Mimori always like that in terms of personality?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, kind of, but it was the first time I saw Yui laugh so much. After all, Yui at school is isolated.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember that Mimori sitting in the classroom, looking at her phone expressionlessly while everyone around her openly avoids her.</p>

<p>Even now, I sometimes wonder if that scene was all lie.</p>

<p>To me, Mimori is a girl who often teases me and laughs at me.</p>

<p>&quot;You can be more proud, you know? You're the one who's making Yui so happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I'm not in love with her, yet we're in a relationship. Honestly, I feel guilty about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You said you couldn't fall in love with Yui, but there's one thing that bothers me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;In Tokami-kun's case, it's not that you can't fall in love, but rather... you don't want to fall in love.... I think that's more accurate.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, my mind went blank.</p>

<p>That's impressive, and I genuinely think so. We've only met a few times, yet she noticed what's going on inside me.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, yeah. In middle school and stuff, I had quite a few unpleasant experiences with girls. So, my default mindset is, 'There's no way girls would like me,' that's how it usually operate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tokami-kun, you have an extremely low self-evaluation. But I think Yui genuinely likes you.&quot;</p>

<p>I understand that. There's also a part of me that wants to respond to Mimori's feelings.</p>

<p>But, it's still impossible for me.</p>

<p>Every time I exchange words with Mimori and starts to open up, there's always a warning sign within me saying, &quot;Don't let your guard down,&quot; reminding me not to develop romantic feelings for her.</p>

<p>Because if I were to fall in love, I would be deeply hurt when I inevitably get betrayed.</p>

<p>In other words... I don't even have the courage to fall in love with Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for now, I guess that's fine.&quot; Kurusu-san drinks her drink with a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>&quot;...I seem carefree, but despite appearances, I'm actually quite troubled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not saying that falling in love with someone is wonderful or anything like that. If Tokami-kun doesn't want to fall in love, that's okay. It still means something for you to be by Yui's side.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san wears a gentle smile.</p>

<p>&quot;If possible, please stay by Yui's side forever. That's all I wish for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>Just staying by Mimori's side, huh?</p>

<p>While Kurusu-san says that, there's still a barrier between me and Mimori. And the one creating that barrier is none other than me. So, I proposed something.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Kurusu-san... I have something I'd like to discuss.&quot;</p>

<p>...And a few minutes later.</p>

<p>&quot;Senpai! And Kurusu-san! Sorry to keep you waiting!&quot;</p>

<p>When I turned around, Suzune and Mimori is there standing.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just my imagination, but both of them seem to have softer expressions compared to earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I'm sorry, but I have to go home soon... Thank you for helping me look for a gift today. Let's meet again somewhere!&quot;</p>

<p>With parting words, Suzune left.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, what did you and Suzune talk about?&quot; I asked Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a secret. Suzune-chan asked me to keep it between us.... But she did advise me not to approach you at school.&quot;</p>

<p>A secret, huh? It piques my curiosity...</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, it's getting late. This might be the last place..... Time went by so quickly. Has a day ever gone by this fast?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori murmured, her face somewhat looked lonely.</p>

<p>Before I realized it, I found myself speaking to Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;There's one last place I want to go. Is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...With you, Riku-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>It's natural for Mimori to be surprised. It's the first time I've ever said I want to go somewhere. And then, I said my proposal we planned earlier with Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're okay with it, I want to ride the Ferris wheel... Just the two of us, you and me.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> The Ferris wheel at the seaside was surprisingly empty, and we were able to ride without waiting in line.</p>

<p>The staff closed the door, and the Ferris wheel carrying us slowly ascended.</p>

<p>At that moment, I can see Kurusu-san waving her hand. I couldn't hear her voice, but it seemed like she was saying something, and her mouth movements felt like saying &quot;Do your best.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't know who she was encouraging, Mimori or me.</p>

<p>&quot;I never expected you to suggest riding this. Ahaha, even though we're always alone when we meet, it feels strange, doesn't it?&quot; Mimori, sitting in front of me, chuckled. Her shy face was so different from the mischievous girl who usually teases me, and it was charmingly innocent.</p>

<p>I've realized recently that Mimori is proactive but vulnerable to accidents. Even when I accidentally touched her chest, she got embarrassed. Maybe her attack power is high, but her defense is extremely low. I remember there were cards like that in the card game I used to play in elementary school.</p>

<p>...Well, I'm nervous too, though.</p>

<p>&quot;But thank you. Riku-kun, you're reluctantly dating me, right? That's why I was happy when you invited me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I feel the same way. Even though I say I don't want to fall in love, you're still willing to be with someone like me. I should be the one who should be grateful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... We both felt like we were causing trouble for each other.&quot;</p>

<p>With a smile on her face, Mimori gazed at the sunset over the sea.</p>

<p>&quot;Even this date, I was surprised that you're the actual planner on it. It's usually me who wants to be with you, so I never expected you to invite me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>Inviting her to the Ferris wheel was exactly the reason why.</p>

<p>If she asked me to scream &quot;Ahh!,&quot; I would do it. If she asked me to touch her upper arm, I would. I would try to fulfill Mimori's desires, enduring the embarrassment, for most things.</p>

<p>But despite being in a relationship.</p>

<p>I have never once asked Mimori to do something for me.</p>

<p>&quot;...Since middle school, I've always been rejected by girls.&quot;</p>

<p>The words spilled out as if I'm apologizing.</p>

<p>&quot;Being disliked were more natural to me than being like, and those unpleasant memories have always in my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, Suzune-chan was so concerned about me because of that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;*Sigh*... So you noticed it after all, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course, when someone stares at me like that...&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori chuckled softly, as if finding it amusing.</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune-chan seemed like she wanted to protect you, Riku-kun. I was curious about why... But it seems Suzune-chan knew about your past.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... It's not really a big deal. But I think there are probably quite a few guys like me out there. You know, those who realize that having a girlfriend is just impossible for them. Umm, it's probably just me.&quot;</p>

<p>It's nothing special, just a common occurrence.</p>

<p>Confessions being brutally rejected, love letters being plastered on the blackboard the next day, being gossiped about for having an odd way of speaking, being laughed at for having an unappealing face, being treated like a punishment to talk to, being blatantly avoided during team activity, being cried over when paired up for the sports festival, being disliked for merely existing...</p>

<p>Everyone has at least one memory they want to erase from those kinds of experiences. I think I'm just bound by those memories.</p>

<p>&quot;So, one day, I thought to myself. Instead of pursuing unrequited love, I should just give up from the beginning... If I don't expect anyone to like me, then I won't get hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>Even now, I don't think that way of living is wrong. After all, there's no right or wrong in how someone chooses to live their life.</p>

<p>...However, if there's one thing that wants to change, it's myself...</p>

<p>It's that I fear even falling in love with a girl who says she likes me.</p>

<p>I fear that Mimori, too, will eventually betray me. That fear won't let go in my heart and mind.</p>

<p>I'm afraid of desiring. I'm afraid of longing. I'm afraid of being rejected by Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry... Even though saying these things will only trouble you.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if she's disillusioned with me. Sometimes, I even think it would be better if she just got fed up with me.</p>

<p>Someone like me who isn't prepared to fall in love probably deserves to be rejected in the end.</p>

<p>In the silence, only the Ferris wheel moves slowly... and then, Mimori softly speaks.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been about two weeks since I started dating you right, Riku-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah?&quot;</p>

<p>What could be the problem? That's what crossed my mind as I tilted my head in confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;I've actually been told by several guys to become friends with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You?&quot;</p>

<p>What is she talking about...? I couldn't bring myself to voice that question.</p>

<p>Mimori, with a gentle expression, looked straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;They all really used similar words. They said something like, 'I feel bad for Mimori-san, I want to help you somehow.' Even when I refused, they would keep pleading.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But isn't that strange?&quot;</p>

<p>If they knew about the rumors surrounding her, they should have understood the risks of becoming friends. It's hard to believe they would easily offer their help... And then, it suddenly echoed in my mind. A certain phrase uttered by Takahashi-kun resurfaced.</p>

<p>'--There were apparently several guys trying to get with Mimori, you know? After all, it's an easy chance to get that experience.'</p>

<p>No way...</p>

<p>&quot;But in the end, it was all a lie. They all had ulterior motives... Ah, but don't misunderstand. They didn't lay a finger on me, and I managed to escape from all of them.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't find the words to respond.</p>

<p>Even after experiencing such a terrible betrayal, Mimori still wore a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;The longest one lasted was probably a week, before they started making moves forcefully... But it's been two weeks since we started dating, and you haven't even tried to hold my hand, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Congratulations, you hold the record for the longest. It's the first time that someone genuinely treats me like this, without any ulterior motives.&quot;</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was clenching my fist so tightly that it hurt. Anger burned inside me, threatening to consume my mind.</p>

<p>Why? Why can't the people around me... see who she is?</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, you believe that no girl could possibly like you, right? But... I like you.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's gentle smile, illuminated in the evening sun.</p>

<p>&quot;You're kind to others, and you always care about me. I'm falling in love with every part of you... Even the painful memories and the past you want to forget. I'm sure they were so difficult that you didn't want to remember. Thank you for opening up to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh... Mimori is truly an unwavering girl.</p>

<p>She doesn't try to cheer me up or push me, but she simply stays by my side for the sake of the person she loves.</p>

<p>I can't help but to fall in-love Mimori, but there's just part of me that's afraid of her. The fear of being rejected by her is still present in my heart, like a curse. It's not something that can easily be overcome... But even so...</p>

<p>I just want the courage to connect with her in this moment.</p>

<p>Leaving the seat with my racing heart, I sit next to Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>I feel my breath quicken with nervousness. My mind feels hazy, as if I'm in a dream.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid, speak up.</p>

<p>You're Mimori's boyfriend, aren't you?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Mimori... Can I hold your hand?&quot;</p>

<p>My voice is trembling, on the verge of breaking.</p>

<p>What if she's disgusted? What if she rejects me and throws hurtful words at me? If I think about it, I won't be able to look at Mimori's face... Then, a soft warmth in my right hand.</p>

<p>When I glance at Mimori, she smiles and intertwines her fingers with mine.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, it's fine... It's the first time you've reached out to me like this, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>Emotions couldn't be put into words.</p>

<p>Awkwardly and clumsily, we interlace our fingers and hold hands. It's called the lover's grip. The way we're holding hands now, it's something I cannot possibly do if Mimori were teases me to do it.</p>

<p>I think it feels warm.</p>

<p>I wonder if Mimori feels the same way.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. It's not that I don't believe your words, Mimori, but... this is the best I can do for now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's more than enough. Riku-kun, you did your best.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori says it as if it's nothing... She's really weak to surprises.</p>

<p>As she smiles, her cheeks turn a shade of red.</p>

<p>The fear is gone but warmth in my right hand is still in. I gaze at the setting sun and whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;It was fun today... I hope we can go somewhere together again, Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that would be nice. We bought swimsuits, so maybe we could go to the beach next... I decided on that because I thought beach would suit to you, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, is that so... Well, I guess I'll have to take responsibility and go with you then.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ferris wheel reaches its peak. All that's left is to get off.</p>

<p>I wish this moment could last forever... but, I couldn't say that. Even now, holding hands with Mimori, my heart beats so intensely that it hurts. I don't even know what would happen if we were alone together like this forever.</p>

<p>But still... I'm glad that Mimori is the one reach to me.</p>

<p>From the bottom of my heart, I truly felt that.</p>
