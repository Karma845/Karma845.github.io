<h1>Second Part</h1><h3>Chapter 7: The Girl Next Seat</h3>



<p> <br />In elementary school, there was no one else but me in the classroom.<br /> <br />I was used to being alone. By then, I had forgotten any memories from preschool.<br /> <br />Still, sometimes scenes I didn’t recognize would pop up in my mind.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A crying girl saying [Promise you won’t forget…I love you. Let’s meet again, okay?]<br /> <br />I couldn’t tell if it was reality or a dream.<br /> <br />But more than that, I was desperately trying to survive each day, so I didn’t have time for such things.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />As usual, I was eating my bento alone during lunch break.<br /> <br />Today it was rice with umeboshi, sliced salmon, shredded cabbage kinpira.<br /> <br />I feel like my cooking skills have improved. It turned out great.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />While eating my bento, I recalled what happened this morning.<br /> <br />When I properly looked at Hanazono’s face, I got embarrassed.<br /> <br />To hide my embarrassment, I ran to school.<br /> <br />I heard her say [Huh, huh!?], but thought I’d talk to her later.<br /> <br />Friends can chat anytime.<br /> <br />Besides, I talked with Hanazono in the hall during short break. She still wasn’t used to my resets.<br /> <br />[…You’re like middle school Tsuyoshi]<br /> <br />She reacted to my casual words.<br /> <br />[Uwaa, I kn-knew but…that’s harsh… It’s okay, I’ll do my best!]<br /> <br />She said she feels absolutely nothing for me. Hanazono should understand that, so why did she look sad? But it can’t be helped.<br /> <br />Our relationship starts now.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My classmates were happily eating in groups. I wasn’t included but it’s good they get along. Puts me in a good mood too.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Yoosh!! Let’s eat! Yamada, you going to the cafeteria today?”<br /> <br />“Huh? My sis made me a bento.”<br /> <br />“I’ve got deep fried bento again!!”<br /> <br />“….You always have that huh… But deep fried stuff is good.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Deep fried… Come to think of it I’ve never had any. I’ll try making it sometime.<br /> <br />While thinking about that, the girl next seat kept glancing at me.<br /> <br />Her name is…Sasaki Miki-san. I remember all my classmate’s names. I try to be prepared in case someone talks to me. She’s on the track team but I heard she’s been plateauing lately.<br /> <br />“Um… Toudou-kun.”<br /> <br />I couldn’t get any words out right away.<br /> <br />I’ve never spoken to Sasaki-san before. Just knowing her name doesn’t mean I can smoothly have a conversation.<br /> <br />I could feel weird sweat on my back and my face getting red.<br /> <br />“Toudou-kun, I’m really sorry but, could I use your seat later? One of my friends from another class is coming…”<br /> <br />It took me some time to understand.<br /> <br />Around Sasaki-san were her fellow track club members. …Hyodo-san, from the class next door Igarashi-kun, Mitobe-san, and Takizawa-kun.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I finish eating quickly and walk around school anyway so I don’t mind. Feel free to use it. Sasaki-san probably asked because she knows what I do.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I need to say something back to Sasaki-san. But I’m struggling to get any words out.<br /> <br />Hurry up and say something. Hurry up and finish eating. My head is in chaos.<br /> <br />“S-sorry, could you wait a bit?”<br /> <br />I wanted to speak in a softer voice. What came out sounded blunt.<br /> <br />“Oh, uh, of course… You don’t have to rush…I mean, anytime after you finish is fine so…”<br /> <br />Getting apologized to by Sasaki-san confused me even more.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />I can’t eat with this many people watching me.<br /> <br />…Calm down in times like this. They’re just asking a favor. They just want to eat with their track club friends. Moving seats isn’t a big deal. I can go to the courtyard quickly.<br /> <br />My heart is pounding like crazy. It’s been a while since I talked this much with classmates.<br /> <br />“–It’s no problem.”<br /> <br />“Oh… You don’t have to be in such a hurry…”<br /> <br />I swiftly packed up my bento and put it in my bag on my shoulder. Eating in the courtyard sometimes isn’t bad.<br /> <br />The weather is nice too, it’ll probably feel good. Moving quickly will make Sasaki-san and the others happy too.<br /> <br />“Ah, thank you very much…”<br /> <br />When I briefly glanced at Sasaki-san’s face–for some reason she looked scared.<br /> <br />“….Weird, what’s with that, gross.”<br /> <br />“Idiot, Igarashi. He can hear you–plus he let us use the seats so we’re the rude ones here.”<br /> <br />“Well, I did say I’d wait until he finish eating.”<br /> <br />“But his attitude was unpleasant.”<br /> <br />“You’re the one being unpleasant.”<br /> <br />I was going to head to the courtyard but overheard their whispers.<br /> <br />Why is she scared? All I did was readily give up my seat. ……Why am I being badmouthed?<br /> <br />I’ll work up the courage to ask. I’ll initiate contact. I promised Hanazono I’m moving forward.<br /> <br />I decided to turn around and ask Sasaki-san.<br /> <br />“Hey, Sasaki-san. Am I really that unpleasant?”<br /> <br />Seeing me come back, Sasaki-san’s face turned pale.<br /> <br />“Wha, uh, y-you heard…I-I’m really sorry…”<br /> <br />“What? Miki did nothing wrong, it was me who said it.”<br /> <br />“Um, let’s stop…”<br /> <br />Igarashi-kun stood in front of me as if shielding Sasaki-san…<br /> <br />I was confused.<br /> <br />How did it become this situation? All I wanted was–to give up my seat, and ask why she was scared.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Igarashi-kun doesn’t have a bad physique but looking at his arm size you can tell he’s been skipping strength training.<br /> <br />His balance is off. Without balanced muscle development–<br /> <br />I end up thinking about things completely unrelated to the situation. That’s no different from escapism.<br /> <br />Whenever I try talking to classmates, it always backfires.<br /> <br />…But don’t give up.<br /> <br />“Say something, dude.”<br /> <br />“Oh, I was just curious.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />“I wanted to know why Sasaki-san got scared, that’s all.”<br /> <br />With a fed up expression, Igarashi-kun asked Sasaki-san.<br /> <br />“Miki, is this guy…a little weird?”<br /> <br />“Igarashi-kun…let’s stop, okay? I-I’m the one in the wrong so–“<br /> <br />“No, you don’t need to apologize to me. ……What did I do wrong? Why? I just want to know.”<br /> <br />Igarashi-kun sighed and told me.<br /> <br />“Geez, seriously? Um…Toudou was it? You’re scary, dude. Your face and atmosphere, I can’t tell what you’re thinking. Gives me the creeps. Miki got scared of course. I mean, where were you planning to eat your bento?<br /> <br />“The courtyard since the weather is nice.”<br /> <br />“Hey, eating alone in the courtyard, the girls’ hangout spot! Well, sorry, we kind of created that atmosphere. My bad. Oh, is it because you don’t have friends? Judging by Miki’s situation, you probably don’t.”<br /> <br />“Well, Igarashi, you’re, a bit too harsh…”<br /> <br />“Oh, sorry, didn’t realize.”<br /> <br />Sasaki behind Igarashi looks apologetic. They don’t seem to fully grasp what they did wrong.<br /> <br />“Oh, is that so? I… thought I was doing the right thing—”<br /> <br />“No, if we just go by your words, you seem like a good guy. It’s our bad for getting scared. I’ll take care of Miki, so don’t worry!”<br /> <br />So, this is the power of those living a fulfilling life—<br /> <br />I can speak normally.<br /> <br />I’m genuinely moved. Every word I say gets a response.<br /> <br />“I appreciate your consideration. Once again, I’ll head to the courtyard—”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Someone enters the classroom.<br /> <br />At the same time, I heard a tongue clicking.<br /> </p>



<p>“Hey, Tsuyoshi. Let’s having lunch… huh? What’s with this atmosphere?”<br /> <br />Hanazono approaches me with a lunchbox in hand.<br /> <br />“Oh, um, this is Igarashi-kun here. He was just telling me a few things. I was expressing my gratitude.”<br /> <br />“Oh no… It’s hard to handle when classes are different, huh? Come on, Tsuyoshi, let’s go to my class!”<br /> <br />“I’m getting hungry. Hanazono, let’s go to the courtyard since the weather is nice. Oh, and then, Igarashi-kun and the others, enjoy your meal. Also, Sasaki-san—”<br /> <br />“Yes?”<br /> <br />“Sorry for scaring you. My bad.”<br /> <br />I think I had a tense expression. I tried to put on the biggest smile I could.<br /> <br />Suddenly, Igarashi-kun slapped my shoulder. It didn’t hurt, but… why?<br /> <br />“…Huh? Those muscles are insane… Puhaha!! This is hilarious, Todo! You should come and join the track and field club sometime! And you actually have friends too, huh? Even though Hanazono is a bit of a disappointing beauty. She hardly makes any male friends. I don’t really know Hanazono well, but good for her.”<br /> <br />“Igarashi… shut up. I’ll kill you…”<br /> <br />I decided to interject.</p>



<p>“Hanazono and I became friends this morning.”<br /> <br />“Huh? I thought you two were always…well whatever, it’s fine!”<br /> <br />I tapped Igarashi-kun on the shoulder like he did to me. Is this proof of friendship?<br /> <br />“Hit me harder!! Your strength is crazy! See, Toudou’s not bad. Hang with the track club sometime! Anyway you guys go eat in the courtyard! We’ll eat here!”<br /> <br />“Then excuse us–“<br /> <br />Sasaki-san deeply bowed her head at me. It was a cute gesture.<br /> <br />–I see, so this is interacting with people. You can fix mistakes.<br /> </p>



<p>I heard tongue clicking again.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Heyyy, could you keep it down? Don’t go causin’ trouble in our class if you’re an outsider, ‘kay? Oh Toudou was in my class huh? Since you’re always alone I thought wrong.”<br /> <br />“Rokka, stop…”<br /> <br />“C’mon, have some deep fried tofu, it’ll improve your mood~.”<br /> <br />I’d been sensing Rokka’s gaze the whole time.<br /> <br />Because of how Igarashi-kun and Sasaki-san responded, I ignored it.<br /> <br />“Whaaat~. You taught me so earnestly before, even letting me call you teacher~. I didn’t hate it at all~. But you abandoned me now? When did you make up with the liar girl? Huh? Did you get charmed?”<br /> <br />I tilted my head, confused.<br /> <br />What’s so funny? I don’t understand at all.<br /> <br />“Um…if you want tutoring let me know, but I don’t know about Rokka-san well so…”<br /> <br />“Hah!? That attitude, what’s with you! Really irritating. A loner acting like that. I invited you karaoke alone but you refused… You actually wanted a date with me, right! You really can’t read the air.”<br /> <br />Is this animosity okay?<br /> <br />I don’t care about malice from unrelated people.<br /> <br />I reset my relationship with Rokka.<br /> <br />I erased those tutoring sessions from my memories.<br /> <br />Just left records of it in my head with no emotions attached.<br /> <br />“I wanted to go out with Rokka-san alone? Sorry but I don’t understand what you’re saying.”<br /> <br />“Huh!? Di-didn’t understand…? Are you making fun of me? You waited two hours because you wanted to see me, right? You wanted to meet me, right?”<br /> <br />“Oh, that incident. Were you satisfying yourself by making me wait? I see, the Michiba is quite a unpleasant person.”<br /> <br />I speak to myself as if confirming the facts. The classroom starts buzzing.<br /> <br />The classroom buzzed.<br /> <br />“What happened with Rokka and Toudou?”<br /> <br />“Something like making him angry because she made him wait around….”<br /> <br />“Geez, worst.”<br /> <br />“He was tutoring her right?”<br /> <br />“Don’t care, let’s eat!”<br /> <br />“Toudou-kun, poor guy.”<br /> <br />“But Toudou doesn’t have any emotion in his voice? Creepy…”<br /> <br />I don’t really like being the center of attention. I wanted to get out of there quickly.<br /> <br />“Hanazono, let’s go to the courtyard. Hm, what’s wrong?”<br /> <br />“….I’m okay. Let’s go.”<br /> <br />Rokka stood up.<br /> <br />“Hey, wait a minute! Self-satisfaction… seriously, that ticks me off. I’m better than a girl like that! You’re a bad judge of people. She’s a liar, right? She called you a convenient man!”<br /> <br />I stop and glance at Michiba.<br /> <br />I still can’t comprehend it. The Hanazono situation shouldn’t have anything to do with Michiba.<br /> <br />There’s no need to explain.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“This has nothing to do with Michiba. Stop badmouthing my friends any further.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The classroom became dead silent.<br /> <br />I don’t like such a quiet classroom. I like the noisy classroom atmosphere. Why did it get so quiet?<br /> <br />Because Michiba-san and I are talking?<br /> <br />Before long, the class started buzzing again. But it’s not the kind of lively feeling I like.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Huh…? You, you’ve never gotten mad no matter what I said before, right? Wa-wait a minute…”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Mad? I’m not harboring any intense emotions like that.<br /> <br />Curth responses are enough for unrelated people.<br /> <br />“I deduce your emotion is jealousy? Because I’m friends with Hanazono.”<br /> <br />“Whaa!? As if I’d be jealous over you guys!! I-I can study alone now anyway!”<br /> <br />I see, so she didn’t understand the meaning of that tutoring session.<br /> <br />“No good. That tutoring wasn’t aimed at fundamentally improving your studies. It was just to quickly get higher test scores. I don’t think you can get the same scores next test.”<br /> <br />“Huh…? B-but with the same methods–“<br /> <br />“I predicted the test questions based on all the teachers’ past trends and personalities, plus my intuition. Impossible if you do it alone.”<br /> <br />Rokka’s face was turning blue. Is she not feeling well? Someone should take her to the infirmary.<br /> <br />“Uh, then teach me again! It’s unfair with just the liar girl!”<br /> <br />Our conversation still isn’t connecting.<br /> <br />Is it due to my lack of communication skills?<br /> <br />I should explain to Rokka-san again, properly.<br /> <br />“Sorry…I absolutely don’t want to teach you again. Please don’t get involved with me. –And one last time, don’t badmouth my friend.”<br /> <br />“Ah, um… but…”<br /> <br />Michiba’s body started trembling. She’s probably not feeling well<br /> <br />This isn’t the time to talk with me.<br /> <br />I need to say it in a loud voice to make sure it’s heard.<br /> <br />Is the noise from my classmates too loud?<br /> </p>



<p>“Please shut up for a minute “</p>



<p>When I said those words, the class became dead silent again.<br /> </p>



<p>Rokka-san isn’t responding…<br /> <br />…It should be fine if it’s this quiet, right? Should I go closer–<br /> <br />I approached Rokka-san.<br /> <br />“Huh? Wh-what!? St-stop, don’t come…!”<br /> <br />Rokka-san’s shaking got worse.<br /> <br />“N-no, sca…scary…”<br /> <br />Just then, my head was flicked. It didn’t really hurt.<br /> <br />It was Igarashi-kun.<br /> <br />“Idiot! You’re super scary! Even I’m freaked out as a guy! C’mon, I’ll take care of this so hurry and go eat with that unfortunate cute girl of yours!”<br /> <br />“…You’re right, Igarashi-kun. You’re a good person.”<br /> <br />“Sh-shut it! Hurry up and go! Rokka, drink some tea and calm down!”<br /> <br />Igarashi-kun blushing in embarrassment looked dazzling to me.<br /> <br />I could feel the classroom’s atmosphere relax thanks to Igarashi-kun.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Rokka who hadn’t moved at all was getting her back rubbed and spoken to by her friends. I’m sure everything will be blamed on me. But that’s fine.<br /> <br />Because I have my friend Hanazono.<br /> <br />Anyway, I’m hungry. Let’s go to the courtyard.<br /> <br />I wasted unnecessary time.<br /> <br />In the end, I still don’t really understand what Rokka-san wanted to say.<br /> <br />She’s unrelated so I’ll forget about it.<br /> <br />I took Hanazono’s frozen hand and left the classroom.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />In elementary school I didn’t have these kinds of relationships.<br /> <br />Adults only saw me as numbers.<br /> <br />I remember them getting elated and dejected over my scores.<br /> <br />There was a kind adult. He would praise me when I tried my best. And sometimes, he would give me very sweet candy.<br /> <br />That was my only joy.<br /> <br />Now that I think about it, I realize how lonely that was.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />Lunch break ended so quickly…<br /> <br />There wasn’t enough time to chat leisurely with Hanazono in the courtyard. We ended up just eating lunch in the courtyard. I felt a little lonely…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />So today, we decided to take a detour on the way home together for the first time in a while.<br /> <br />It feels like so long ago.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />We decided to go into a family restaurant called Saizeriya. It was my first time going to a family restaurant with Hanazono. On the way home, we would usually stop by a burger place or crepe shop. I feel a little nervous.<br /> <br />We ordered drinks at the drink bar.<br /> <br />“Tsuyoshi, in the past I thought that I could keep you to myself even if you got into trouble… But I need to change too.”<br /> <br />While drinking a green colored drink, Hanazono said that to me. What is that? I’m curious…<br /> <br />I remembered the first time I ever drank soda, back when I graduated from elementary school.<br /> <br />It was at Hanazono’s house when her aunt offered it to me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Sweet—delicious. At that time, I felt like my taste buds were being revolutionized. I was shocked to discover such a drink existed in this world.<br /> <br />Recently, during the karaoke incident, I learned about the existence of a drink bar.<br /> <br />The astonishing fact that you can drink this wonderful beverage as much as you want. The world is truly profound…<br /> </p>



<p>“Hey, are you listening!”<br /> <br />“It’s fine. Hanazono, was my behavior at lunch… okay?”<br /> <br />“Of course you were thinking something else right? Well, whatever. I think you’ve improved from the past. The thing with Igarashi… well, that was just a misunderstanding.”<br /> <br />“Igarashi is a good guy.”<br /> <br />“He’s not a bad guy. But because of his personality, many people dislike him.”<br /> <br />What? Even someone like Igarashi is disliked? I couldn’t believe it.<br /> <br />“Anyway, it ended up being a chance for you to talk with your classmates, so that was good. But the thing with Michiba…”<br /> <br />“Hm? Why’s that? My relationship with Michiba should be over.”<br /> <br />“Because of the Michiba thing, everyone in class might think you’re scary. That girl… just remembering makes me so mad. It makes my stomach churn. At least she exposed her own wrongdoings… “<br /> <br />“I don’t intend to get involved with Michiba again.”<br /> <br />“Michiba will probably be quiet for a while. She’ll be desperate to regain the class’s trust. I don’t think she’ll voluntarily bother Tsuyoshi. But since it’s Michiba… it makes me uneasy.”<br /> <br />I was shocked.<br /> <br />At that time, both Igarashi and Sasaki used the word “scary”.<br /> <br />I’m scary? I think I look normal. I try to be as plain and unnoticeable as possible.<br /> <br />Did I give my classmates that kind of impression? No one told me. No one talked to me. Neither Michiba nor Sasami said anything. Were they just using me?<br /> <br />“Ha, did you think I was scary too, Hanazono?”<br /> <br />“In middle school… yeah. But it’s different now right? You’re kind. So kind that… I ended up falling for you… Ah, no, now we’re just friends but… Everyone doesn’t know the kind Tsuyoshi!”<br /> <br />It hurt to know that I’m seen as scary to others.<br /> <br />I thought that after interacting a little with Igarashi and Sasaki, we could become friends…<br /> <br />Maybe it’s better to not get involved at all… Won’t that hurt less?<br /> <br />If so–I should erase what happened–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono looked at me with a faint smile.<br /> <br />“It’s okay, this time I’m here too. So, let’s make friends slowly. It would be bad to erase the connections you’ve made right? Let’s move forward… together, the two of us. Because Tsuyoshi is kind, people who understand will know–“<br /> <br />“I see, if I erase it, I can’t move forward. …Hanazono, thank you again for becoming my friend.”<br /> <br />“Yeah–“<br /> <br />After that, Hanazono and I continued talking at Saizeriya. It was time for me to go to my part-time job, so we decided to continue tomorrow.<br /> <br />Chatting casually with a friend… it’s fun. I spent this time feeling that.<br /> </p>


<h3>Chapter 8: The Budding of Incomprehensible Emotions</h3>



<p> <br />I work part-time at a western food restaurant in the shopping district.<br /> <br />Today is Tanaka’s day off.<br /> <br />I’m terrible at customer service, so I focus on food preparation and washing dishes.<br /> <br />The busy rush hour was like a battlefield. …I know actual battlefields are more hellish, this is just a metaphor.<br /> <br />“Hey! The fish is burning! Bring it out quickly!”<br /> <br />“Can I get the bill please!”<br /> <br />“The order for table 2 is wrong! I need the gratin!”<br /> <br />“Are you serious! You… take this out first!”<br /> <br />“Murakami– wrong order again! How many times already!”<br /> <br />“Oh shoot, I’ll be careful~”<br /> <br />I started this part-time job about 6 months ago.<br /> <br />Thanks to Tanaka’s training, I’ve slowly gotten used to this work.<br /> <br />Watching people’s movements and providing what’s needed to who needs it–<br /> </p>



<p>The chef seems to be looking for something.<br /> <br />While washing dishes, I place serving plates in front of the chef on my way to put away the clean dishes.<br /> <br />“Thanks, you’re a big help!”<br /> <br />I bow my head like Sasaki taught me.<br /> <br />The bussing (clearing empty plates) tasks is falling behind while the dishwashing is almost done.<br /> <br />To avoid being spoken to by customers, I clear plates from finished tables.<br /> <br />The timing here is most important to me. In the past, I’ve angered customers many times by being spoken to by adults I don’t know. When spoken to by adults I don’t know, my mind goes completely blank.<br /> <br />Adults are incredibly frightening to me.<br /> <br />Today is a rare day without Tanaka. The chef is in the kitchen. There’s no one to help. But I want to help with service.<br /> <br />I slip into the hall without making a presence. In an instant, I grasp which tables haven’t been bussed and take action.<br /> <br />Somehow, without being spoken to, I finish bussing and devote myself to the dishwashing once more.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Man, Toudou, you’re diligent so you’re a big help. Thanks again. Great work!”<br /> <br />“Yes, if I’m of use like this–“<br /> <br />When spoken to by the chef I get nervous. The chef waved his hand as he headed to the office.<br /> <br />As I’m changing in the break room, the male college student part-timers come in.<br /> <br />“I’m beat~, it was crazy busy today.”<br /> <br />“Oh yeah, I got yelled at by the chef again… this is just a part-time job right?”<br /> <br />“You’re aiming to become a chef right? Can’t be helped. Hey, let’s go drinking.”<br /> <br />“Oh, Kiyomi is coming too right?”<br /> <br />“No way! I’m gonna make my move on her.”<br /> <br />I bow my head to the college students. But there is no reaction.<br /> <br />The college student part-timers treat me like I don’t exist.<br /> <br />A man who can only wash dishes and do food prep. That was my evaluation.<br /> <br />There are no greetings at all. No, sometimes they’ll talk to me to joke around when girls are present. …It seemed they were enjoying my reactions. I don’t understand what was so funny.<br /> <br />But I understood it wasn’t very nice laughter.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Since Tanaka isn’t here, there’s no need to wait today.<br /> <br />As I quickly changed and was about to leave the staff room, a university student named Murakami approached me.<br /> <br />“Hey, Toudou, you go to the same school as Tanaka, right? Hey, next time, make sure to join our drinking party. I’m kinda into her type.”<br /> <br />“Hey, you can’t be messing with high school girls!”<br /> <br />“Huh? It’s fine. There are quite a few guys at work dating high school girls, you know?”<br /> <br />“Well, she does have a cute face.”<br /> <br />“But her personality is tough.”<br /> <br />Oh, I need to contact Tanaka about the cafe situation. I always end up putting it off. I get stuck thinking about what message to send.<br /> <br />I should just send the date and time. I’ll send the message later.<br /> <br />“Hey, are you listening? Answer me!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’m listening.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Are you disrespecting me? Use polite language!”<br /> <br />“Hey, Murakami, cut it out. He’s a high school student, you know? Besides, Toudou started working here before you, so you’re the junior.”<br /> <br />“Haha, use polite language with him.”<br /> <br />“Toudou seems scared. Be gentle with him.”<br /> <br />“No, no, this guy is creepy. I do mixed martial arts, so handling someone like him is a piece of cake.”<br /> <br />Ah, he’s saying this about me.<br /> <br />Since the conversation wasn’t pleasant, I pretended not to hear and said,<br /> <br />“I’ll go ahead—”<br /> <br />As I left the staff room, I could hear laughter even outside.<br /> <br />They must be laughing at me.<br /> <br />I can’t cause any trouble. The chef hired me, and it might cause inconvenience for Tanaka. Plus, I don’t know how to handle this situation. Getting angry will only lead to problems. I don’t care about myself, but it bothers me when they talk about Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–What does everyone do in times like this?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I don’t know the right answer.<br /> <br />Those people are kind to me and teach me work when alone.<br /> <br />But they change when in a group.<br /> <br />It’s okay, they’re irrelevant people so it won’t hurt.<br /> <br />So not getting involved is probably best.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Leaving the shop, I buy a drinks from the nearby vending machine. My daily routine on days I work.<br /> <br />Today, I’ll try challenging this thing called coffee. Which one is super sweet?<br /> <br />I’ve heard adult men drink coffee. Today I feel like drinking coffee.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Yoo-hoo! You’re here! I knew you’d be here. Hehe, I was just at karaoke! And I thought it’d be about time for Toudou to finish work!”<br /> <br />“Ta, Tanaka?”<br /> <br />I turn around and Tanaka is there in her school uniform. The boy from before is with her.<br /> <br />They’re standing close. It looks like they’re holding hands. Seeing that, it feels like my heart leaped up.<br /> <br />The boy greeted me with a slight bow, so I return a bow. His gaze is observing me. A flawless composure. His center of gravity is stable. His dignified form is very cool.<br /> <br />He bids farewell to Tanaka and leaves the scene.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka sees him off, waving both hands. Her gesture is very cute. Even I can tell her affection is directed at him.<br /> <br />…What is this? I’m feeling a strange emotion. This is the first time. I’m curious about Tanaka and that guy’s relationship? No, those two must be a couple. Tanaka and him suited each other very well.<br /> <br />There’s no room for me to enter. …Why am I thinking such things? I’m unrelated. Get your emotions in order.<br /> <br />I thought the fuzzy feeling would disappear with deep breaths. But it won’t go away.<br /> <br />After seeing him off for a while, Tanaka faces me. Her smiling face illuminated by the vending machine light was dazzling.<br /> <br />“Even though I went to all the effort of coming to pick you up today, you could look a little happier!<br /> <br />“No, I’m really happy. Really–“<br /> <br />Seeing her smile, the feelings of isolation and haziness in my heart disappeared.<br /> <br />I felt kindly. Yet my chest hurts a little.<br /> <br />What is this?<br /> <br />“Hehe, good! I was worried since we don’t work together today, and you’re always by yourself Toudou!”<br /> <br />The chef is considerate and always schedules Tanaka and I for the same shifts. Of course there are days we aren’t together like today.<br /> <br />Tanaka goes “alley oop” as she comes beside me.<br /> <br />We start walking.<br /> <br />“You made up with Hanazono right? I’m glad!<br /> <br />“If you hadn’t pushed me, it wouldn’t have happened. Thank you.”<br /> <br />“Wh, being thanked with a serious face… we, well it makes me happy!”<br /> <br />“And, how did you make up?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I explain to Tanaka what happened with Hanazono. And also the classroom happenings<br /> <br />–This time Tanaka doesn’t hit me on the head.<br /> <br />She walks happily with her arms behind her back.<br /> <br />“You’re clumsy, but you tried.”<br /> <br />Those words seeped comfortably into my heart.<br /> <br />“Yeah, I made an effort. But still… I don’t understand what everyone is thinking. Just earlier, I didn’t like that part-timer Murakami was badmouthing you. I couldn’t do anything.”<br /> <br />“Idiot, that’s better than most. Girls are way harsher. They’ll readily betray friends… “<br /> <br />“Re, really?”<br /> <br />“Yeah. And there’s definitely girls like Michiba messing with people in every class. They’re a real pain. Murakami is annoying.”<br /> </p>



<p>Tanaka sighed.<br /> <br />It seems she recalled something.<br /> <br />“And also, it’s out of character for you think that way about me, but it makes me reaaally happy…”<br /> <br />Tanaka smiled at me so happily.<br /> <br />“Reset– normally it’d be unbelievable, but I think you can do it Toudou? To reset your feelings.”<br /> <br />“I only speak the facts.”<br /> <br />“Ahaha, that’s so like you. It makes me a little envious. If I could reset my feelings like that… I could become a new me…”<br /> <br />“Is that so? Did Tanaka want to reset at some point too?”<br /> <br />“You experience all sorts in life.”<br /> <br />“I–don’t want to reset anymore.”<br /> <br />Tanaka looked at me seriously.<br /> <br />“Yeah, you build up all kinds of experiences and become friends. …Hey, um, I want… to join Toudou and the other’s group of friends, can I? I don’t have friends either, ahaha.”<br /> <br />I tilted my head. Tanaka should have lots of friends. She was happily singing karaoke with her friends at that time. And there’s that cool guy.<br /> <br />My chest hurts a little.<br /> <br />It’s not a painful hurt. Not a sad hurt–<br /> <br />What is this?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“So, that guy from earlier–isn’t he your boyfriend?”<br /> <br />“Huh? My brother? Ahaha, I just tolerates him following me around!”<br /> <br />Brother… I see, he’s her brother–<br /> <br />For some reason, the prickling in my chest settled down. I suddenly felt like running with all my strength. It’d feel great to run all-out.<br /> <br />“Oh yeah! I had a souvenir for you Toudou! It’s thanks for always walking me back from work. Here!”<br /> <br />Of the two bags she’s holding, Tanaka takes one and hands it to me. Perplexed, I receive it.<br /> <br />“Hehe, it’s cake from a famous cake shop around here! I’m giving the other to my brother! I should have made him carry it! Geez!”<br /> <br />To Tanaka, was I just a convenient guy she could take advantage of? And yet she said she wanted to be friends with someone like me?<br /> <br />The weight of the bag she gave me felt nice.<br /> <br />Sweets, something I only eat on special occasions. The candy I received from [adults] was sweet. It was my only happy memory. When I failed at school in middle school and went home depressed, the juice I drank was sweet yet a little salty. At a festival I went to alone, with coins clenched in my fist, I shrank away at the crowds in front of the food stalls and couldn’t buy a candy apple.<br /> <br />Memories come back. Happy memories and sad memories.</p>







<p><br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Wha, hey… why are you crying!? Toudou!?”<br /> <br />“No, this is sweat. It happens occasionally.”<br /> <br />“No way! That’s not it!”<br /> <br />While wiping the sweat with a handkerchief, I honestly conveyed my feelings.<br /> <br />“I want to eat together with you–“<br /> <br />“Huh!? R-Really? Okay, that’s great. But, will you be my friend?”<br /> <br />Sweat seemed to pour from her face again. She was desperately trying to restrain something welling up inside her.<br /> <br />I don’t understand this feeling. But instinctively, I know it’s a pleasant one.<br /> <br />“I also want to be friends with you.”<br /> <br />“Alright, then from now on we’re friends! Hehe, actually, I thought we were friends all along. I was just too shy to say it.”<br /> <br />“Is that so? I thought you were just being opportunistic with me.”<br /> <br />“Huh? No way! Come on, let’s eat over there in the park!”<br /> <br />“O-Okay.”<br /> <br />In the darkness, I couldn’t see clearly, but her face seemed to be turning slightly red.<br /> <br />I followed behind Tanaka. Though this area is safe, it’s dangerous for a girl to walk alone at night.<br /> <br />I’ve been hassled many times myself.<br /> <br />We sat on a bench and opened the cake box. I had seen this in the display windows of shops in town before. If I remember correctly, it’s called a shortcake.<br /> <br />“Oh, there’s only one fork, so you eat it Toudou.”<br /> <br />Tanaka handed me the fork. After hesitating a little, I used the fork to cut the shortcake in half.<br /> <br />“I want to eat with Tanaka. Let’s split it in half. You eat first.”<br /> <br />“O-Okay, thanks~”<br /> <br />Tanaka ate the shortcake with the fork.<br /> <br />While humming a tune happily, she seemed to be really enjoying it. I found myself captivated by her simple humming. It shook my heart like a moving melody. And eating while humming a tune, Tanaka is quite skilled.<br /> <br />“Oh, you should eat too, Toudou!”<br /> <br />“Yes, then……”<br /> <br />“W-Wait! Not with your bare hands!”<br /> <br />“I see, may I use that fork then?”<br /> <br />“Uh, o-okay….”<br /> <br />I took the fork Tanaka handed me. I stabbed the remaining shortcake with the fork. When I was about to bring it to my mouth, Tanaka muttered “Ah, yaba.” I understand “yaba” is abbreviated slang for “yabai” It’s used in dire situations or to mean something is amazing. ……While wondering about this, I stuffed the cake in my mouth.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Delicious.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When you eat something truly delicious, the words just naturally come out.<br /> <br />The cream, strawberries, and sponge are all delicious, but combining everything together harmonizes the flavors and seems to double the density. Of all the sweets I’ve eaten so far, this is the most delicious.<br /> <br />When I finished eating, the scent of strawberries lingered. It made me want another bite.<br /> <br />This is an amazing confection. It was my first time eating cake from a specialty shop.<br /> <br />The sponge cake faintly smells of almond. The cream has an aroma like it contains liquor.<br /> <br />Oh, I shouldn’t hog it all. When I was halfway done, I returned the fork to Tanaka.<br /> <br />“You eat some too, Tanaka.”<br /> <br />“O-Okay, I’ll eat.”<br /> <br />The usually spirited Tanaka became a little quiet. Her red face concerns me, but she should be alright. She’s probably just excited from the delicious shortcake. It seems like she keeps glancing at me. Does she want to tell me something?<br /> <br />Tanaka gobbled down her portion of the cake in one bite.<br /> <br />“You should eat the rest, Toudou….”<br /> <br />As I ate the remaining shortcake, I realized something.<br /> <br />Certainly this cake is delicious. But eating together with my friend makes it taste even better.<br /> <br />“Friends are a mysterious thing.”<br /> <br />“You don’t need to think about it so deeply. We work the same part-time job and go to the same school. We’re both loners and coworkers, so we’re new friends!”<br /> <br />“Yes, it’s an indescribable feeling.”<br /> <br />“By the way, isn’t Toudou actually senior? The way you talks is so amusing!”<br /> <br />“Huh, really?”<br /> <br />“Nah, it’s not weird at all. That calm demeanor of his is kinda cool.”<br /> <br />“Is that so… Well, that’s a relief.”<br /> <br />It was a strange sensation, different from when I’m with Hanazono. Perhaps it’s a sense of tranquility?<br /> <br />I won’t forget this day.<br /> <br />The cake Tanaka and I ate in the park at night tasted like the gentlest flavor I’ve ever experienced—</p>

h3>Chapter 9: Gradually Expanding Circles</h3>



<p> <br />Intense training became a daily routine. Pain accompanied me every day. There were times when I was left behind in the forest. The night forest was frightening, but I could sense life other than my own. It was challenging but not lonely.<br /> <br />One day, a large dog appeared in the elementary school classroom.<br /> <br />A kind adult said it was okay to play with it. I timidly touched the dog.<br /> <br />The first dog I touched was very soft—<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lately, I’ve been having dreams of past events. It’s probably just a small part. My memories are still gapped, affected by the resets I did when I was young. There must have been events I wanted to erase so badly.<br /> <br />There’s no need to look back at the past. I’m a high school student now. Recently, I’ve finally felt the circle of friends expanding around me.<br /> <br />While having lunch with Hanazono in the courtyard, I received a message from Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Where are you now?]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I see, does texting eliminate the habit of saying things?<br /> <br />I quickly reply, and Hanazono looks at me with a puzzled expression.<br /> <br />“That’s unusual. Using messages and all. Oh, is it Tanaka-san? You became friends?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, Tanaka is a good person. The cake was delicious.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, she’s really cute, that girl.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, she’s a very cute girl. But objectively speaking, I think Hanazono is also very cute.”<br /> <br />“Oh, you! Don’t casually say things like that about a girl! I-I mean, I’m not cute or anything.”<br /> <br />“People’s aesthetic sense can’t be relied upon. Let’s drop this topic.”<br /> <br />“Haa, that’s just like you.”<br /> <br />“By the way, Tanaka mentioned wanting to be friends with us?”<br /> <br />“Us? She seems like she has a lot of friends, though…?”<br /> <br />“She said she feels lonely by herself.”<br /> <br />“Oh, now that you mention it. I’ve never seen her with friends.”<br /> <br />I felt someone approaching us.<br /> <br />I can tell by the scent that it’s not Tanaka.<br /> <br />“Hey, Toudou! Are you eating with Hanazono again? Let’s have a meal together next time with us!”<br /> <br />For some reason, Igarashi in his athletic gear appeared in the courtyard. It’s still lunch break now. Not time for club activities yet.<br /> <br />Sasaki-san was with him. In a small voice, Sasaki-san said to Igarashi, who was yelling loudly, “I-It’s embarrassing….” The female students around them were laughing at the scene. But it wasn’t weird laughter. It was warm laughter.<br /> <br />I have a similar yet completely different experience. In middle school, when I talked loudly to Hanazono I was laughed at by those around us for some reason. That time, the laughter was closer to ridicule. I must have said something weird.<br /> <br />“W-Why are you looking that way at me!?”<br /> <br />“No, I was just remembering something from a while back.”<br /> <br />“Y-You don’t need to remember!”<br /> <br />Seeing our exchange, Igarashi for some reason heaved a sigh.<br /> <br />“Geez, Hanazono should be more honest. You’re totally tsundere, aren’t you?”<br /> <br />“Don’t call me that! You’re ruining our rare alone time–I mean, that’s not it! I’m just looking out for Toudou…. Oh no, I can’t mess this up again….”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />“Y-Yeah, I want to be with Toudou so we eat lunch together! Oh no, sorry….”<br /> <br />“N-No, don’t apologize. I shouldn’t have teased you…..”<br /> <br />“Hmph, as long as you understand.”<br /> <br />The tempo of Igarashi and Hanazono’s conversation was too fast for me to grasp. But one thing I understood was that Hanazono sitting next to me had gotten closer. Our shoulders were touching.<br /> <br />I asked Igarashi a question, unconcerned about such things.<br /> <br />“Why are you wearing athletic gear?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Oh, cause we have P.E. next period! It’s a pain to change later so I did it earlier!”<br /> <br />“I see, that makes sense.”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san kept glancing at me.<br /> <br />We don’t make eye contact in the classroom. I’m always careful to act in a way that won’t startle her. But recently I’ve felt her gaze on me. Thinking it would be bad to bother her, I’ve been pretending not to notice.<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />“Miki, don’t you have something you want to say?”<br /> <br />Igarashi prompted Sasaki-san with his chin.<br /> <br />“Y-Yeah….”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san timidly stepped forward. Yes, like a hamster I saw on TV. Her small body was filled with tension. It made me tense too.<br /> <br />“Toudou-kun, I’m s-sorry for being scared of you. Lately when I look at you, Toudou-kun, I thought maybe you’re not so scary after all.”<br /> <br />“What about me is scary? I don’t understand it myself.”<br /> <br />“Um, like how you never talk and give kind of indirect answers when you do talk to someone. And how your expression doesn’t change, oh, I’m sorry–“<br /> <br />“No, thank you for telling me.”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san held out the book she had been holding to me.<br /> <br />What’s this?<br /> <br />“Um, Toudou-kun, m-maybe you could try reading some novels? I really love novels, manga, and movies. I think through stories, you can come to understand people’s hearts and–“<br /> <br />Stories, huh…. In the past, even when I went to see movies with Hanazono, I couldn’t grasp the content at all. I didn’t understand why the audience was crying. Hanazono cried at that time too–<br /> <br />I recalled Hanazono’s crying face at the movie theater.<br /> <br />She looked sad yet happy at the same time, a refreshing crying face. She was very beautiful. I have a [record] of it in my head.<br /> <br />“Sasaki-san, thank you. I’ll try reading it.”<br /> <br />“R-Really! This is a good one. The protagonist’s feelings and the heroine’s inner conflicts are portrayed wonderfully and….the cool male friend is nice too, hehe, the interactions between the male friend and protagonist are….”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Igarashi grabbed the hem of Sasaki-san’s uniform.<br /> <br />“Hey! Miki, don’t spoil too much! Anyway, Miki is worried about you.”<br /> <br />It’s okay. I can grasp that much without being told. I may not read the air well, but I’m sensitive to people’s feelings.<br /> <br />I lightly tapped Igarashi on the shoulder.<br /> <br />Was it like this?<br /> <br />“Woah! Do it more forcefully! “<br /> <br />While rubbing his shoulder, Igarashi looked at my arm. What is it?<br /> <br />“….Yeah, Toudou, let’s arm wrestle for a bit. I’ve been curious about your muscles lately. You’re pretty damn strong right? As the top in our class, I don’t wanna lose!”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san and Hanazono exchanged glances.<br /> <br />“Boys are like kids.”<br /> <br />“Y-Yes, like elementary schoolers….”<br /> <br />–What? Isn’t elementary school a brutal battle for survival? ……But I have a question.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–What’s arm wrestling?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I said that, for some reason Igarashi–sympathized? Befuddled? Was perplexed? While forcing a smile, he said to me.<br /> <br />“Then this’ll be your first match…. Let’s enjoy it together!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />We ended up arm wrestling on the small table next to the bench in the courtyard.<br /> <br />Since Hanazono didn’t stop me, I must not be mistaken.<br /> <br />“Hanazono, give us the signal please!”<br /> <br />“Geez, okay okay. Get in position–“<br /> <br />“The hell!? It’s ‘Ready, go’, right!?”<br /> <br />“Eh, what’s that? It’s too embarrassing!”<br /> <br />“Never mind, I’ll give the signal myself. Toudou, let’s go!”<br /> <br />Igarashi and I gripped each other’s hands. The moment we did, Igarashi had an astonished expression.<br /> <br />I see, it’s a game of competing strength.<br /> <br />Depending on where you grip, the principle of leverage comes into play so the grip is important. The force conveyed to the opponent changes based on where you grab their fingers.<br /> <br />….It’s not just a game of pushing the arm down with brute strength. There seems to be a technical system involved. Hmm, interesting. The muscles in the legs and whole body are also important.<br /> <br />“Ready….go!! Huh!?”<br /> <br />As expected of the track team, he has a lot of muscle mass. He’s conveying power by linking the leg muscles. But his body balance is bad. He must be slacking on training. With this level of strength–<br /> <br />“Ngg….w-wait a sec…nggg….o-oi, I’m….serious here!? It won’t budge!?”<br /> <br />Even after ten-something seconds passed, Igarashi couldn’t move my arm.<br /> <br />You win by pinning the opponent’s arm to the table, right?<br /> <br />I slowly pushed Igarashi’s arm down. I have to be careful not to injure him by using too much strength.<br /> <br />“W-Wait! Ngg….my arm’s gonna–! Stop, stop! Haa…. Toudou, you’re crazy strong…. I prided my strength as top in the class, but this is fun!! Let’s hang at the arcade sometime!”<br /> <br />Despite losing, Igarashi had a refreshed look on his face. He seemed happier than me, the winner. Since I’ve never interacted with classmates this way before, I don’t know what expression I should make.<br /> <br />“You’d instantly become the ace if you joined the track team. You sure you won’t join? ….Well, I can’t really recommend the current track team….”<br /> <br />“Why is that? The track team–“<br /> <br />“Oh, the relationships in the track team are kinda, well, Miki and I are rejects so there’s all kinds of hassles. But anyway, let’s play together sometime!”<br /> <br />“I will make good use of that…. Oh, I mean, we definitely will.”<br /> <br />“Alright, it’s a promise!!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–At that moment, I sensed the presence of a small being behind me. I swiftly twisted my body to avoid colliding with them.<br /> <br />I saw a girl about to fall down. I grabbed the collar of her uniform to keep her from falling.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Sasami, is that you?”<br /> <br />The flustered Sasami was there….</p>



<h3>Chapter 10: Sasami Misami</h3>



<p>I walk down the hall leading to the courtyard, looking at my face in a compact mirror. Pretty as always today. I’m definitely making up with Senpai today.<br /> <br />I went to the second year classrooms but Senpai wasn’t there. When I asked a female student nearby, she spat “Hah!? I don’t know that guy!” ….She looked really mean. What’s with her? Super annoying.<br /> <br />When I asked other students, I got the info that Senpai was eating lunch in the courtyard. Times like this I think it’s nice being cute. The male student I talked to looked happy.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My feet quickened on their own as I headed to the courtyard. Experience tells me it’s best to apologize quickly after a falling out. It’ll definitely be okay….<br /> <br />But I can’t get that earlier side of Senpai out of my head.<br /> <br />Shimizu-senpai is the ace of the track team and the captain. Senpai isn’t on the team. Which one to prioritize is obvious….<br /> <br />But still, the speed of senpai’s running on the field was insane. The morning runs were held back for my sake.<br /> <br />Senpai’s feet moved so fast that he looks like blur. It was a little cool.<br /> <br />At that time, I know my way of speaking was bad.<br /> <br />But I can’t control my greed. This personality will never change.<br /> <br />….To put it mildly, my family is very poor. I got into this academy on a track scholarship. My mom works hard for me. After track I work part-time at a family restaurant. We couldn’t get by otherwise.<br /> <br />So I can’t make the wrong choices. Classmates, upperclassmen, teammates, it doesn’t matter.<br /> <br />I have to leave good results at this academy’s track team.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Whenever I won competitions, senpai gave me various gifts. It made me happy but….I envied senpai’s wealthy household. Honestly, I felt jealousy….<br /> <br />Senpai isn’t on the track team. If the team captain Shimizu-senpai dislikes someone outside the team, they won’t survive at the track team. Oh well, it can’t be helped.<br /> <br />……Since Senpai is kind and sweet, I thought it would be okay if I apologized later. Shimizu Senpai is stubborn, and I believe I need to say something like that to make him believe me.<br /> <br />Senpai’s cold expression comes to mind. My steps in the hallway come to a halt. I’m scared of meeting Senpai. Surely, if I explain the reasons, it’ll be okay… I think.<br /> <br />I check my face once again in the handheld mirror. After calming my heart, I walk back to the courtyard.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />For Senpai, Mimi is a cute junior, so it should be fine. Senpai has said I’m cute too! He’ll definitely forgive me!<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Lately, I haven’t been able to meet Senpai, and it’s making me anxious.<br /> <br />I can’t see him during the morning run, and I can’t find him at school. Going to the upperclassmen’s classroom is scary.<br /> <br />If I cry and apologize, everything will surely be fine.<br /> <br />Since Senpai taught me how to run, my body has felt much lighter. I achieved results beyond my abilities at the junior high competition. Even in high school, I believe I won’t lose to the same year if it’s about running.<br /> <br />When Senpai massages Mimi’s body like a chiropractor, it feels so comfortable, and I can run endlessly.<br /> <br />Senpai always watches over Mimi’s training kindly and attentively. He always cares about my body. Yet, I called Senpai a stalker, and if I don’t apologize soon, I won’t be able to run with Senpai.<br /> <br />…Senpai, you should polish yourself more; you’re surprisingly cool. If you do that, Mimi might—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I reach the courtyard, I see Senpai with someone. I see Senpai, who I haven’t seen in a while, looking somewhat more refined.<br /> <br />And it’s the first time I’ve seen him with a friend, despite him saying he has no friends.<br /> <br />Those are the track and field team’s dropouts, Igarashi Senpai and Sasaki Senpai. And there’s a super beautiful girl gazing at Senpai… It’s irritating, but she’s way cuter than Mimi… It’s annoying.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Mimi takes a deep breath and smiles at her reflection in the hallway’s glass. It’s okay; I’m cute too.<br /> <br />Yeah, Senpai will forgive me for being a cute junior who takes a lot of effort. That’s me.<br /> <br />I start running quietly towards Senpai. Senpai hasn’t noticed Mimi yet. He’s talking to Igarashi Senpai.<br /> <br />A natural smile spreads across my face. Yeah, running with Senpai was probably the most fun.<br /> <br />I realized it when we were apart.<br /> <br />I feel happy at the thought of being able to run together again. Senpai is cute even though he seems like an old man.<br /> <br />Mimi tries to hug Senpai’s back.<br /> <br />“Senpaai! Long time no see!”<br /> <br />Mimi tried to hug senpai, but his body was nowhere to be found.<br /> <br />“Huh!?”<br /> <br />I lose balance with too much momentum—oh, am I going to fall!?<br /> <br />“Mugu!? Goho, goho.”<br /> <br />“Sasami, is that you?”<br /> <br />I thought I was going to hit the ground, but I feel my collar being grabbed. It was a bit suffocating due to the impact, but at least I didn’t fall.<br /> <br />When I raise my head, Senpai is standing there. Senpai indeed saved me.<br /> <br />“S-Senpai, th-thank you! As expected, there’s no one else for Mimi but Senpai!! Senpai—?”<br /> <br />Senpai wasn’t looking at my face. He was facing Igarashi Senpai.<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />“Igarashi-kun, are you okay?”<br /> <br />“I’m fine. By the way, Toudou knows Sasami?”<br /> <br />“Hey, Igarashi Senpai, be quiet! I’m talking to Senpai!”<br /> <br />“You’re still a troublesome girl. Do as you like.”<br /> <br />Ah, the spectators are noisy. I’m about to ask Senpai for forgiveness.<br /> <br />“Senpai!! …I’m sorry for what happened the other day because of Senpai Shimizu. It couldn’t be helped. If I got on the wrong side of Senpai Shimizu, I couldn’t survive in the track and field club.”<br /> <br />I appealed to Senpai with intense acting. But I feel discomfort.<br /> <br />Senpai’s atmosphere is different. Senpai’s expression hasn’t changed at all. I can’t see a trace of kindness. It’s as if he’s a different person.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A chill runs down my spine.<br /> <br />“Eh, a, Se, Senpai…?”<br /> <br />I could only produce a sputtering voice.<br /> <br />I couldn’t feel any emotions. This is what it feels like to see things like a spectator…?<br /> <br />It’s not that he’s angry about what happened the other day or that he’s fed up. At that time, Senpai ran to the field, so I didn’t understand—<br /> <br />Senpai’s eyes are looking at me, but they’re not seeing me… He doesn’t recognize my existence. Suddenly, my heart tightens with regret.<br /> <br />W-Was it possible that I did something irreversible… that I hurt Senpai’s heart…<br /> <br />Panic generates meaningless words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“S-Senpai, is, is it really Senpai?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Fear creeps up from the depths of my heart. My legs are about to tremble… even so…<br /> <br />“–What do you mean?”<br /> <br />“Eh, no, the atmosphere is completely different.”<br /> <br />“It has nothing to do with you.”<br /> <br />“W-What are you saying? Uhm, aren’t Senpai and I close? I sincerely apologize for what happened the other day.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry; I don’t understand. What kind of relationship did you and I have?”<br /> <br />I can sense it. He’s not lying. Senpai isn’t seeing me at all. He’s not angry. He’s indifferent…<br /> <br />It was a light feeling. To get along well with Senpai Shimizu, I cut ties with Senpai.<br /> <br />Because of that, did the kind Senpai’s heart become strange?<br /> <br />As I think about it, my heart throbs painfully. What is this? W-What have I…?<br /> <br />“I’m, uh, Sasami Mimi. We used to do morning practice together, I-I’m your junior…”<br /> <br />“Oh, I understand that. It’s in my memories. But for me, Sasami is no longer someone relevant.”<br /> <br />Senpai’s words stab into my heart like a knife. The words are flat, too flat, but their sharpness cuts deep.<br /> <br />“I-I wanted to apologize…”<br /> <br />“Don’t worry about it. I’ve finally come to understand. The connections with important people. So, please leave me alone.”<br /> <br />Senpai looks at Igarashi and the others. His face shines with a radiance that, frustratingly, surpasses the mornings he spent with me.<br /> <br />When he turns to face me, his expression returns to an emotionless state.<br /> <br />–It’s scary. Only now do I realize the weight of what I’ve done.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Yo! Toudou! Oh, by the way, you’re Hanazono-san, right? Finally, we meet! I’ve heard a lot about you from Toudou!”<br /> <br />A female student comes running while calling Senpai’s name. Wait, isn’t that Tanaka Senpai from the special class!? She’s the super-beautiful gal rumored to have a famous celebrity brother, and she never tried to make friends.<br /> <br />When Senpai sees Tanaka Senpai, his aura becomes gently warm, more than when he accompanied me during morning practice. His kind eyes are very charming, filled with emotions.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That’s what I’ve wanted–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />But it’s all because of Senpai Shimizu’s fault. I didn’t do anything wrong…<br /> <br />“Tanaka, let me introduce you to Hanazono. Oh, and these are Igarashi-kun and Sasaki-san.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Who’s that girl? She looks like she’s about to cry. Are you okay?”<br /> <br />“Mm, Sasami, why are you crying? Do you want to go to the nurse’s office?”<br /> <br />“—-Ah…”<br /> <br />At that moment, I understood.<br /> <br />I wanted to punch my past self, who was selfish and self-centered.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I can’t run with Senpai anymore…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I step back from Senpai, turning my heels.<br /> <br />The fake crying I intended turns into real tears. The miserable feeling that I thought I was accustomed to becomes unbearably painful.<br /> <br />Sobs are about to overwhelm me. I didn’t want Senpai to see me. A feeling of regret wells up from the bottom of my heart.<br /> <br />I start running towards the hallway–<br /> <br />Pain shoots through my knees from the ground. The reckless running puts a strain on my body.<br /> <br />A familiar voice reaches me from behind–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–Sasami. Your injury is already healed. The leg you’re protecting is more dangerous. Go to the hospital quickly.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That emotionless loud voice resonates in my heart.<br /> <br />Even without emotions, Senpai’s kindness reaches me.<br /> <br />Those words trigger an explosion of emotions–<br /> <br />I want to escape from Senpai’s sight quickly. I don’t want to be in this place anymore.<br /> <br />Even though Senpai can’t see Mimi anymore, I can’t stop my feet.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Why… Why is Senpai being kind to someone like me!? Ugh… ugh… Uwaaaaahhhh!!<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Waves of emotion hit me. A pain in my heart like I’ve never experienced before. It hurts so much, and there’s nothing I can do… If I run, it’ll get better. I always overcame things by running. So, if I run, the pain will go away.<br /> <br />“Ah!”<br /> <br />The rubber of my sneakers breaks, and they fall to the floor like they’re rolling.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My legs hurt. My knees hurt. My arms hurt. But more than anything–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The sneakers Mom bought for me. In our poor family, we can’t afford to buy spares.<br /> <br />“Sneakers… are broken, ugh. Ah, haha… what should I do… Mom, what should I do… I… Mom, Mom…”<br /> <br />If I get injured, it’ll make Mom sad. I don’t want to be a burden to Mom. I don’t want her to know that I’m crying. If I get injured, I can’t stay at the academy. Mom always rejoiced when I won in competitions. I want Mom to smile–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Suddenly, Senpai’s smiling face comes to my mind.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Ah–, Senpai, too, was smiling for me…<br /> <br />I pick up the fallen sneakers and walk down the hallway, crying unabashedly…</p>

<h3>Chapter 11: Cutting Hair</h3>



<p> <br />I didn’t know my own birthday. I always write January 1st on official documents.<br /> <br />I never thought of birthdays as important.<br /> <br />So, I always forgot Hanazono’s birthday. It was a routine.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />After school one day, I was walking home with Hanazono.<br /> <br />I told her I had made plans to go to a cafe with Tanaka but had not decided on a time yet. Hanazono got angry at me.<br /> <br />“Tsuyoshi, you’re hopeless! If a girl wants to go on a date, you have to make plans right away, idiot!”<br /> <br />“A date? I was just going to casually meet at a cafe.”<br /> <br />“Going to a cafe together, just the two of you, that’s basically a date! Going together to a place, chatting…looking around other places…”<br /> <br />“I was planning to just drink some juice and then go home.”<br /> <br />“You’re hopeless. Really, you need to practice beforehand then. Because if you show up to your date with Tanaka looking like a mess, she’ll hate you!”<br /> <br />“I see, that would be bad.”<br /> <br />“Not just bad! You don’t get what I mean at all!”<br /> <br />“What do you mean then?”<br /> <br />“I’m not going to tell you!”<br /> <br />“Hmm, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you be so stubborn, Hanazono. How nostalgic.”<br /> <br />“Oh be quiet! Anyway, we’re going to practice! And your hair is a mess! You can’t go on a date looking like that!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Get a haircut to go out?…That idea didn’t even cross my mind. I’ve only been to a barbershop once before, but I didn’t like having a stranger stand behind me with blades. I always cut my own hair. I don’t want to go to the barber.<br /> <br />“You’re going to cut my hair?”<br /> </p>



<p>“What’s with that look on your face? I know you’ve always hated barbershops. Can’t be helped, I’ll cut it for you!”<br /> <br />“I’m not really feeling up to it, but I’ll let you do as you wish.”<br /> <br />“It’s not about what I wish! If you show up to your date looking like a mess, Tanaka will hate you!”<br /> <br />“I see, that would be bad.”<br /> <br />“So you’re going to properly get it cut! Wait for me later, I’m coming over to your apartment!”<br /> <br />“Understood, I’ll wait.”<br /> <br />And so I ended up preparing for my “date” with Hanazono. I still don’t really understand the difference between a date and going out. Doesn’t really matter I guess. More importantly, am I really going to let someone else cut my hair? I don’t like it but I’ll endure for the outing with Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“You better stay home! I’m just getting some tools, be right back!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When we arrived at my apartment building, Hanazono said that and ran off to her house. Though my apartment and Hanazono’s house were only a few dozen seconds away on foot.<br /> <br />I entered my apartment and put my stuff down. Then I went to the kitchen to prepare some drinks.<br /> <br />Hanazono likes bitter coffee. I boiled water in a pot and put instant coffee in a cup for her. It was a cup Hanazono had left here back in middle school.<br /> <br />My apartment was quiet. With nothing extra, this room felt comfortable.<br /> <br />I only really study in here. I picked up the zoology book I had been reading. Though I don’t mean studying for school classes. I read interesting papers, look up what’s trending with youth, solve math puzzles.<br /> <br />The world is full of things I don’t know. I’ll never get bored.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After just a few minutes, the door chime rang. Based on the rhythm of the footsteps, I could tell it was Hanazono. I opened the front door. Hanazono was there, having changed from her uniform into casual clothes.<br /> <br />“Come in.”<br /> <br />“Pardon the intrusion. Wow, it’s been so long since I came to your apartment…It’s barely changed at all from middle school.”<br /> <br />“I made coffee. Drink it.”<br /> <br />“Oh, thanks!”<br /> <br />I handed Hanazono the freshly brewed cup of coffee. Looking at the cup in her hands, Hanazono murmured in a small voice “My cup…hehe…”<br /> <br />I don’t understand the meaning of those words. But I can tell Hanazono looks happy. While watching her, I drank my own coffee. I tried the same black coffee as Hanazono. The nice aroma of coffee passed through my nose but…<br /> <br />“Bitter.”<br /> <br />“You’ve never liked bitter stuff.”<br /> <br />I decided to add lots of sugar and milk to make it drinkable. Carrying her cup, Hanazono moved to the living room. I followed her to the living room as well.<br /> <br />“As usual, there’s nothing here. Just books I can’t understand.”<br /> <br />“Are you not going to cut my hair? I’d like to get it over with quickly…”<br /> <br />“Huh? It’s fine after we finish the coffee right?”<br /> <br />“I don’t mind either way but…”<br /> <br />Hanazono was looking at the photo stand. It held a picture of me and Hanazono in our high school uniforms, standing in front of Hanazono’s house. Her dad had taken it on entrance ceremony day.<br /> <br />Next to the photo stand was a Pomeranian stuffed animal, [Pomekichi]. Hanazono had made me buy it back in middle school. Now he was an important friend of mine. Sometimes I pretend he’s a person and practice talking to him.<br /> <br />Looking at the Hanazono in the photo, I don’t feel any nostalgia. Because I reset all my feelings about Hanazono.<br /> </p>







<p><br />“What about that photo?”<br /> <br />“It’s just…nostalgic.”<br /> <br />I can’t share those feelings. To me, it’s nothing more than a past event. My chest doesn’t hurt. However, I felt a stir deep in my heart.<br /> <br />Peaceful time passed by. What could Hanazono be thinking about? It’s very difficult for me to guess what people are thinking.<br /> <br />…I didn’t dislike this time. My heart calmed. Even without feelings, being by Hanazono’s side settles me. Sleepiness comes.<br /> <br />Hanazono, having finished her coffee, took some tools out of her bag. For once, Hanazono smiled at me.<br /> <br />“Alright, let’s cut your hair.”<br /> <br />“Oh, okay. Can I hold Pomekichi?”<br /> <br />“No way…his fur will get everywhere.”<br /> <br />I nodded ambiguously. Then Hanazono handed Pomekichi to me.<br /> <br />“Can’t be helped huh. You’ll properly clean him later. For now, hold him inside the cape.”<br /> <br />“Understood.”<br /> <br />This should alleviate some of the fear. Even if it’s Hanazono, having someone else holding blades is scary. …I wonder why I find it so scary? Even searching my memories turns up nothing. Perhaps there is something in my lost memories. Oh well, no use worrying about it.<br /> <br />Holding Pomekichi, I headed towards the bathroom.<br /> </p>



<p>Today, Hanazono was unusually talkative. While cutting my hair, she kept complaining.<br /> <br />“Hey, why are you cutting it like that!?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Is it too short? It’s too late now!”<br /> <br />“It’s too messy! I’ll use clippers to shave it off.”<br /> <br />“Oh, oops. Well, it’s okay. I can fix it within limits.”<br /> <br />“Let’s tidy up the rest…”<br /> <br />The sound of scissors echoes in the bathroom. Hanazono is cutting my hair with a serious expression. Maybe because I’m holding Pomekichi, I don’t feel too afraid. It’s strange. The last time I went to the barber, it caused quite a commotion. It almost turned into an incident.<br /> <br />“Snip, snip,” the sound continues. Hanazono seems to be quite skilled at cutting hair. It might be a bit too close, though…<br /> <br />I’m feeling a bit sleepy. A lot has happened around me recently. I don’t feel physical fatigue; it’s the mental exhaustion that weighs heavily on me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hey, you’re not sleeping, are you? Say something.”<br /> <br />“…Yeah, let’s talk about our date plans.”<br /> <br />“Wait, what? Our outing is not a date! It’s just a rehearsal!”<br /> <br />“I apologize. Where are we going?”<br /> <br />“Well… let’s start with watching a movie.”<br /> <br />“No, I can’t understand the fun of watching movies—”<br /> <br />“Just come to the movies.”<br /> <br />“Uh, okay.”<br /> <br />Hanazono has returned to the way she used to be. No, she seems even kinder than before. There’s no romantic interest, but it’s a good thing.<br /> <br />“Alright, we’re done here.”<br /> <br />“Wow, this looks quite stylish… Almost like a modern young person.”<br /> <br />The reflection in the mirror shows a neat me. I look like a different person. Hanazono also seems satisfied.<br /> <br />As I stand up to thank Hanazono, at that moment—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Wait, in this narrow space, suddenly—kyaa!?”<br /> <br />“Dangerous—”<br /> <br />Hanazono, trying to step back, loses balance. I instinctively support Hanazono’s waist with my left hand. It would be troublesome if she bumped into the wall.<br /> <br />“Hanazono, be careful.”<br /> <br />“Ah, you… C-close, aren’t you!?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“It’s fine. I have no romantic interest, so I don’t mind.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Ah…”<br /> <br />I check to see if Hanazono hit anything. It seems okay. Hanazono dislikes being touched by me. The same thing happened in middle school. At that time, I was scolded harshly, [Hey, you, don’t touch me!].<br /> <br />“Sorry, You’ve always disliked physical contact. I’ll let go of my hand.”<br /> <br />“Uh, yeah… I knew that, but…”<br /> <br />Hanazono mumbles something incomprehensible while looking down. She was holding onto my arm. Perhaps, the shock of almost falling made her confused. It must have been scary. The same reason I hold Pomekichi.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Haha, it’s still tough, huh? But you know, I’ve decided to start from scratch.”<br /> <br />“Hanazono?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s nothing! Come on, let’s clean up because there’s hair everywhere!”<br /> <br />“Well, Pomekichi has hair too…”<br /> <br />“Focus on me, not Pomekichi!”<br /> <br />“Let’s handle it appropriately.”<br /> <br />“It’s not appropriate!”<br /> <br />For a moment, Hanazono makes a dark face. It’s probably just my imagination. She talks cheerfully again, just like before. I was anxious. I wondered if my aura, expression, and tone were scaring Hanazono.<br /> <br />Hanazono grits her teeth hard. That’s a habit of her when emotions are heightened. I remember that from before. But I can’t get back the feeling I erased.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I feel like something is stirring in the depths of my heart. I wonder why.</p>



<h3>Chapter 12: A Date in the name of Rehearsal</h3>



<p> <br />I wash my face in the bathroom and gaze at my reflection in the mirror. A plain and unremarkable face. I’ve been called a faceless background character by my classmates. I practice smiling in front of the mirror. It’s not easy to do well; my face just ends up looking strained.<br /> <br />I create a hairstyle using the beauty magazine I read thoroughly last night as a reference. I bought some wax from the convenience store.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“No problem… but there is a problem.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Resetting feels different this time. I used to be able to cleanly erase any event. Yet, when I’m with Hanazono, it feels like there’s a lump in the depths of my heart.<br /> <br />I ask Pomekichi, who I brought to the washstand, for his opinion.<br /> <br />“I probably need to change seriously.”<br /> <br />Pomekichi doesn’t respond. Of course, he won’t. …Pomekichi is just a stuffed animal. However, I’ve developed an attachment to it. If I were to reset my feelings towards Pomekichi, I could easily throw it away without hesitation.<br /> <br />Thinking about that made my chest ache. It’s because I haven’t reset my feelings.<br /> <br />In elementary school, the orders of “adults” were absolute. So, I kept resetting to protect myself.<br /> <br />I wanted to live a normal life. But I probably didn’t make an effort. I kept resetting over trivial things and running away.<br /> <br />My eyes in the mirror seemed cloudy. …I didn’t become like this to be free. So, I’ll change.<br /> <br />I gently hug Pomekichi and place him next to the photo frame where Hanazono is reflected.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I’m going. Don’t worry while I’m gone,”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I said, not expecting a response. But I felt a sense of relief come over me. I put on the suit I had picked out in middle school and left the house.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />I headed to Yurakucho Line Ikebukuro Station, the closest subway station, to go to Toyosu Station. The line is always empty. My destination was a big cafe with delicious juice inside a shopping center. Since the shopping center has a movie theater, it’s just right.<br /> <br />The meeting spot was in front of Toyosu Station. I thought we could go together since we’re neighbors. But Hanazono said it was meaningful to meet up. I don’t understand the meaning.<br /> <br />Speaking of which, since I left the house, I’ve felt people’s gazes on me. Especially from women. I was bothered when a woman talked to me on the train earlier. I couldn’t respond well and lowered my head.<br /> <br />Do I look strange? No, that’s not it. This is Hanazono’s fashionable coordination. I believe in Hanazono. Should I really believe in her?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Right on time, I arrived at the above ground exit of the station, our meeting spot. The clear blue sky feels nice. It must be perfect date weather.<br /> <br />When I surveyed the area, I could see Hanazono a bit away with an anxious look on her face. Even from a distance I could tell today’s Hanazono was dressed up. Her hair was different than usual too.<br /> <br />I haven’t seen Hanazono like this since our middle school trip together. I felt my heart skip a beat.<br /> <br />Well, it must be my imagination. I should go over to Hanazono quickly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“What are you saying? I don’t understand! Hey, don’t touch me!”<br /> <br />When I got close to Hanazono, two foreign men had already started talking to her before me. I cocked my head in puzzlement. Friends of hers? They have quite big builds.<br /> <br />[We’re superstars so let’s play together! you’re cute. A Japanese girl like you will surely come with hot guys like us]<br /> <br />[Hahaha, damn right. If you sees my muscles you’ll be head over heels. She probably can’t even speak French or English, but who cares. Just saying “cute” is good enough, right?]<br /> <br />[No mistake, hahaha!]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Southern French accents. I don’t have good memories of Southern France. So I don’t want to hear French much. I stepped in between the man trying to grab Hanazono’s arm.<br /> <br />Hanazono looked relieved when she saw me.<br /> <br />“Oh, Tsuyoshi… Thank goodness you’re here,” she said.<br /> <br />[Who’s this pretty boy?] [Is he your man? Whatever, piss off]<br /> <br />The bald man got close to my face. He has a big face. It looks like he does some kind of combat sport since his ears are misshapen and his face is full of scars.<br /> <br />[Why should I disappear? I’m going out with Hanazono]<br /> <br />[Huh? You can speak French! And with a Southern accent too! Play interpreter for us, we’re gonna play with this girl]<br /> <br />[Why should I have to do that?]<br /> <br />[Just do what I say!]<br /> <br />The bald man tried to grab Hanazono’s arm again. I grabbed his hand.<br /> <br />When this guy is close, I recall the fishy smell of Southern France. My reset emotions and patchy memories. Now’s not the time to get sentimental.<br /> <br />Today I’m practicing a date with Hanazono.<br /> <br />I won’t forgive anyone who tries to harm my friend.<br /> <br />I’m returning to that sensation–<br /> </p>







<p> <br />[Don’t grab Jean’s arm! Get him, Jean! Do it, Jean! …Jean? What’s wrong?]<br /> <br />The one called Jean had a panicked look. It’s nothing much, I’ve just immobilized his arm.<br /> <br />Without hesitation, I called the police.<br /> <br /> 110.<br /> <br />Forcibly taking someone away is not good.<br /> <br />[I’m calling the police now. Japanese police are excellent. What I feel from you two is a nasty smell. Oh, the police? Right now some foreigners are harassing me. –Please give me a response. –Ah, excuse me, I’ll switch back to Japanese.]<br /> <br />[He called the cops!? Jean, let’s scram!]<br /> <br />[O-Omar, wait. I can’t move my hand…, I lived in the slums so I know, this guy’s dangerous if we mess with him…]<br /> <br />When I let go, the foreign men ran off. I described the men’s appearances to the police and hung up, then turned to Hanazono.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />She had looked uneasy, but her complexion quickly returned to normal.<br /> <br />I’m glad. If something happened to my friend, I would– How would I feel? I feel like I almost grasped something. It’s not just my imagination. I definitely felt something just now.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono’s long hair shone beautifully in the light. Her clothes were totally different than her normal lazy outfit. She was wearing very cute clothes. Plus light makeup and a fashionable hairstyle.<br /> <br />I unconsciously gasped. I wasn’t consciously aware, but Hanazono is a girl after all–<br /> <br />I have to say something or this awkwardness won’t go away. I’m too nervous to find the words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–S-Sorry I’m late… Your c-clothes are cuter than u-usual…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Pfft…hahaha! What’s with that attitude? And actually, you were right on time. …And when you say my clothes are cute, you’re not supposed to mention the clothes!”<br /> <br />“I see, I’ll remember that for next time.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, thanks! Tsuyoshi…that was cool,”<br /> <br />Hanazono whispered while looking down. It was so quiet that ordinary people probably couldn’t have heard it. But to me, it was clear as day. I felt the temperature of my face rise. I got even more flustered for some reason. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that.<br /> <br />“W-What did you say just now?”<br /> <br />“Nothing at all! Come on, let’s go!”<br /> <br />With a broad grin, Hanazono strode off ahead of me.<br /> <br />Yeah, she hasn’t changed from middle school.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />We headed to the shopping center.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Inside is a movie theater. As we walked, we chatted about random things. I felt refreshingly carefree.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s been a while since we went out together, just the two of us… I’m really glad we can go out again…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, you were never straightforward, Hanazono. There are many things I don’t understand about you.”<br /> <br />“Yeah…that’s true. Hehe, it’s nostalgic, isn’t it? I really was an idiot back then. If only I had been more straightforward…”<br /> <br />“Even now, you’re the only one I can talk to normally, Hanazono….I’m grateful.”<br /> <br />“I’m sure it’ll be fine with Tanaka-san too. You work together, right? Today is a date practice run so I’ll be really pushy!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I trust you more than anyone, Hanazono.”<br /> <br />“Y-You idiot…jeez, you’re too straightforward, Tsuyoshi. But I guess that’s what’s good about you…”<br /> <br />That reminds me, I had a question for Hanazono. Let me try asking her. I always knew Hanazono wasn’t straightforward, but there are some things I won’t know unless I ask directly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“By the way, why did you say you liked Midosuji senpai even though you didn’t? I still don’t really understand that, even now that my feelings for you have been reset.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono stopped walking. I waited for her words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…Pfft, yeah it’s painful. But just being together was–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />She took a deep breath and said to me:<br /> <br />“Well, I was embarrassed. I got teased by my friends, and I thought they’d make fun of you too… Anyway, I was an idiot and not straightforward, but I did like you. I had the foolish confidence that you definitely liked me back…maybe that’s why.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My head started to spin in confusion. I can’t process the information well. It would be easier to solve a math puzzle.<br /> <br />“S-Sorry. I don’t understand…”<br /> <br />“That’s okay, you don’t have to understand. To put it simply, I was hiding my shyness. Yeah, hiding my foolish shyness…”<br /> <br />“I see, hiding your shyness–“<br /> <br />I feel like I understand but actually don’t. Still, Hanazono said back then she wanted to start over as friends.<br /> <br />I can’t recall my feelings from before they were erased. But Hanazono must be special to me.<br /> <br />“Hanazono.”<br /> <br />“Hm? What is it?”<br /> <br />“–I must have liked you too back then. I can’t remember what those feelings were anymore. But I’ll do my best to try and recall them.”<br /> <br />I heard Hanazono sniffle. I hope she hasn’t ruined her nice makeup.<br /> <br />“Dummy…it’s okay. Those kinds of feelings aren’t something you can get back through effort, they have to come naturally. So go forward, Tsuyoshi. This time I’ll do my best!”<br /> <br />“It’s quite complicated.”<br /> <br />“It’s not that complicated at all! Just act according to your true feelings. It’ll be okay, I’ll be by your side if anything happens!”<br /> <br />“That’s reassuring.”<br /> <br />“Yeah! Come on, it’s time for the movie! Hurry!”<br /> <br />Hanazono smiled brightly at me despite her eyes being red.<br /> <br />As expected, Hanazono’s expressive face is wonderful, I thought, as if it were someone else’s business.</p>



<h3>Chapter 13: Not Like a Romantic Movie</h3>



<p> <br />We watched a romance movie.<br /> <br />It was about the protagonist going back to the past and starting over with his girlfriend. In the finale, the audience was moved to tears. Hanazono sitting next to me was bawling. But I couldn’t cry.<br /> <br />I understood the flow of the story. But the nuances of emotion didn’t quite make sense to me. Counting the staff names in the end credits was more enjoyable.<br /> <br />As I awkwardly watched Hanazono cry, we moved to the cafe.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />By the time we got to the cafe, Hanazono had completely regained her emotions. She said “I feel refreshed!” but wasn’t she sad? I tucked away my doubts and entered the cafe.<br /> <br />Today’s main event – the famous cafe with delicious juice. I was really looking forward to the tasty juice.<br /> <br />Even after entering the cafe, Hanazono was still hung up on the movie ending. I was more excited for our ordered juices to hurry up and arrive than talk about the finished movie.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Seriously, the heroine was so pitiful, wasn’t she? The main guy was so annoying…”<br /> <br />“Is that so? What was wrong with it?”<br /> <br />” The protagonist is so hopeless, and the heroine sacrifices everything, and…”<br /> <br />” …I see, my prediction wasn’t wrong. The protagonist is indeed a hopeless guy.”<br /> <br />” Yeah, it wouldn’t be surprising if he gets stabbed.”<br /> <br />” S-So much… I’m starting to get a bit interested.”<br /> <br />” Huh? Didn’t you enjoy watching it with me!?”<br /> <br />” I understood the story, but I couldn’t quite grasp the subtle nuances of emotions.”<br /> <br />” Haa… Well, it can’t be helped. I’ll teach you then!”<br /> <br />” Very well, I appreciate that. Oh, the juices are here. Hanazono, here’s your juice.”<br /> <br />The waiter places the juices on the table. Even though we’re sitting apart, the aroma is extraordinary. Hanazono’s juice has a tropical flavor, while mine is a forest berry mix.<br /> <br />“You were looking forward to it, right? Just go ahead and drink.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I nod and carefully bring the juice closer. The strong fragrance tickles my nostrils. It conjures an image of a forest, not the damp, survival-type forest I experienced. It’s a forest with a refreshing scent of tall trees, connected to a vast grassland.<br /> <br />I take a sip of the juice through the wide straw.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />— I was overwhelmed by an immense shock.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I thought my brain cells were being destroyed. The balance of umami, sweetness, and richness is incredible. The base of blueberries and blackberries is likely domestic. They use natural spring water. The refreshing sensation that pierces through my throat after drinking is incredible. And there’s something like shaved ice hidden in the juice, providing a fantastic accent.<br /> <br />My meager vocabulary can’t adequately describe it.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Delicious.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Only that word came out.<br /> <br />Suddenly, I feel a strong gaze from Hanazono. I didn’t pay attention because I was engrossed in the juice, but she strangely had a reddish complexion.<br /> <br />“What’s wrong? Do you have a fever?”<br /> <br />“Oh, yeah, I just thought it’s been a while since I saw Tsuyoshi smiling, and…”<br /> <br />“I’m smiling? No, more importantly, have I not been smiling before?”<br /> <br />I run my hand over my face. Indeed, my mouth seems to be upturned, and I’m smiling.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s been a while since I’ve seen you genuinely smile. Your smiles were always forced.”<br /> <br />“I-Is that so…? Come to think of it, Hanazono, you’re also drinking juice and smiling.”<br /> <br />Blushing, Hanazono looks somewhat happy. This could be called a lovely smile. Hanazono, with a bright voice, says to me—<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“I felt my heart race seeing you smile, idiot.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The always assertive and rebellious Hanazono looked like a sincere and adorable girl. I felt something more overwhelming than the impact of the juice. But, I don’t know what that something is. It’s okay not to know now. The time will come when I understand.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“By the way, where should we go next?”<br /> <br />Hanazono’s eyebrows twitch slightly. It’s a bit scary.<br /> <br />“Hey! We’ve only been in the cafe for twenty minutes! We should chat while discussing the movie we watched! …Remember when we had cake with Tanaka-san? We chatted then, right?”<br /> <br />— At that time, the conversation flowed, and we chatted so much that we forgot about time.<br /> <br />“Oh, uh, I apologize.”<br /> <br />That’s right. Maybe now we can take our time. …….<br /> <br />Hanazono happily starts a conversation with me. I respond with words even though they stumble out.<br /> <br />Time flows gently.<br /> <br />I felt a sense of tranquility—<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />After leaving the cafe, we headed to a miscellaneous goods store in the shopping center.<br /> <br />“Hey, do not sleep! We’re shopping!”<br /> <br />Having satisfied my thirst with juice, I started to feel sleepy. But, there are still events left.<br /> <br />“Well, we need to go shopping.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, we need to find a thank-you present for Tanaka-san! I’ve heard she’s been a great help at work, so we should show our appreciation!”<br /> <br />“Oh, I’d appreciate it if you could help me pick something, Hanazono.”<br /> <br />The shopping center was incredibly vast. With numerous stores around, it would have been impossible for me to shop alone.<br /> <br />“How about we check out the knick-knack store on the third floor?”<br /> <br />“Sounds good to me.”<br /> <br />The knick-knack store was filled with items that seemed appealing to girls. There were so many things, and their purposes were unclear to me.<br /> <br />“Tanaka-san is fashionable, right? Since it’s a thank-you for the cake, something not too expensive would be nice.”<br /> <br />“Oh, really? … What’s this?”<br /> <br />“This is a beauty roller. Hey, what are her hobbies?”<br /> <br />“I don’t know.”<br /> <br />“Hmm, then what does she like? Ah, this strap is cute! But it doesn’t seem like her style. How about bath salts?”<br /> <br />Hanazono picked up a small plushie strap and a package of bath salts.<br /> <br />“Oh, she did say she likes baths. Let’s get this, Hanazono.”<br /> <br />“Wait, hold on. We should think about various options before buying a present! See, that way it’ll be more thoughtful, right? So let’s browse around a bit more.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, sure. In that case, I’m curious about those dumbbells over there.”<br /> <br />“No, that’s not allowed! Let’s try going that way!”<br /> <br />Hanazono tried to take my hand like she used to. But halfway, she pulled back. I could see a hesitant expression fleetingly.<br /> <br />“Ahaha, Tanaka san would get mad, wouldn’t she?”<br /> <br />“Why would Tanaka get mad? If you wanted to hold hands, you could just hold them like before, right?”<br /> <br />“Well…I’m good for now. Look, this way, this way.”<br /> <br />Hanazono pulled her hand behind her back. I was a little concerned, but shopping took priority over that right now. We walked around the building. In addition to the general store, we also went into a clothing store and an accessory shop. Wherever we went, Hanazono explained things that women like to me.<br /> <br />Her expression looked happy…and a little sad. I wonder why?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After a long time going around the shopping mall, we ended up deciding to buy the stylish bath salts we found first.<br /> <br />The shop assistant wrapped up the bath salts nicely for us, and I put them in my bag. I suddenly felt the muscles in my face change. When I touched my face, I realized I was relaxing. Just thinking about giving someone a present made my emotions so rich.<br /> <br />Our shopping was done, now we just had to head home. Hanazono knew that too. Her feet walked towards the exit of the shopping center.<br /> <br />Hanazono had an expression like a little kid’s. It looked like the inside of a bus at the end of a school field trip that she had enjoyed.<br /> <br />…A field trip. I remembered my lonely junior high school field trips. I shook my head to stop thinking about myself.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–That’s when a whirlpool of memories rushed through my head. Memories of Hanazono.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Hey, why don’t you know this!?]<br /> <br />[Idiot, this is the girl’s bathroom!]<br /> <br />[I want to go home with my friends, but I’m stuck taking care of you.]<br /> <br />[Hey, were you making fun of Tsuyoshi? I’m the only one allowed to make fun of him!!]<br /> <br />[Yes, yes, you ran as hard as you could. You didn’t cheat. I’ll make you rice balls today so cheer up…]<br /> <br />[Why aren’t you giving me a birthday present! Birthdays are very important days!]<br /> <br />[Huh? Going to the same high school?… O-Oh you look happy? No way, idiot!]<br /> <br />[Heya! Since today we’re high schoolers, do something about your messy hair!]<br /> <br />[Ah, your hair’s not messy anymore… Oh well, we’ll go eat ice cream together on the way home today!]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I stopped walking. I couldn’t stop the flowing memories.<br /> <br />“When I met Hanazono, during the sports festival, when I was bullied in class, when I became lonely during team assignments, when I was left behind during the field trip, when we went out together, when we explored the cultural festival together, when I confronted a girl trying to undermine Hanazono behind the scenes, when Hanazono scolded me, when I forgot her birthday—”<br /> <br />The blade of memories cuts through my heart. A heart of steel remains unscathed. But–<br /> <br />“Tsuyoshi? What’s wrong?”<br /> <br />“…Sorry, could you wait here for a moment?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Hey, where are you going!?”<br /> <br />“To the restroom.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Didn’t you just go!?”<br /> <br />“I’ll be right back.”<br /> <br />I started running through the shopping center.<br /> </p>



<h3>Chapter 14: My Beloved Childhood Friend</h3>



<p> <br />“You suddenly started running, and it surprised me!”<br /> <br />“S-Sorry.”<br /> <br />Despite running for so long, my breath didn’t catch up, yet my heart was pounding. I suspected illness, but I knew that wasn’t it.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s okay. We stayed quite late, so let’s head back. It’s good we could find Tanaka san’s present.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it was a splendid purchase.”<br /> <br />The city was already dark. We headed to the station. No need for arrangements; she’s a childhood friend from the neighborhood. We go home together when we go out.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On the way there alone, on the train back, Hanazono sat next to me. Perhaps tired, she dozed off. Before I knew it, her head was on my shoulder. I tried not to move.<br /> <br />“Fuga…”<br /> <br />“Hmm, not a very cute snore.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />We used to play together a lot in kindergarten. I don’t remember those memories now. Perhaps I erased them—resetting, erasing even memories. A past where the Reset didn’t work well.<br /> <br />Still, Hanazono understood my Reset without a hitch. Maybe something similar happened in our past?<br /> <br />Unfortunately, searching through the drawer of memories doesn’t reveal much. Let’s forget about this.<br /> <br />But when I reunited with Hanazono, I felt a nostalgic scent.<br /> <br />I still strongly sense that scent…<br /> <br />[Next stop is Ichigaya—]<br /> <br />…Ah, we’re already arriving at the station. No signs of Hanazono waking up. Or rather, she might be tired, so I don’t want to wake her. In that case—<br /> <br />I gently lifted Hanazono without waking her up. Her body was surprisingly light. I held both my belongings and Hanazono with both hands as we got off the train.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />At the nearest station, relief washed over me. Unfamiliar places are tiring. It’s a quiet residential area, a student district, and a business district.<br /> <br />“Hey, look at that. She seems so happy, huh?”<br /> <br />“Is she drunk? Anyway, it’s pretty lively around here.”<br /> <br />“Darn it, those lovey-dovey students. Acting all lovey-dovey.”<br /> <br />“They walk pretty fast, huh?”<br /> <br />I tried not to pay attention to the surrounding gazes. That’s my secret to living. Still, Hanazono must be really tired. She’s sleeping soundly while snoring.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…Ugh…”<br /> <br />Hanazono’s eyes opened slightly. I stopped.<br /> <br />“Awake, huh. Can you stand?”<br /> <br />“Uh… Wait a sec.”<br /> <br />Hanazono closed her eyes again. Seems like she doesn’t quite understand the situation.<br /> <br />—Let me explain.<br /> <br />“Hanazono fell asleep on the train and I didn’t want to wake you up on the train, so I carried you off the station.”<br /> <br />“Ah, I understand… Wait, no! Why are you carrying me like a princess! You could have just woken me up!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“S-Sorry…”<br /> <br />I indeed messed up. It didn’t work out well in the end. Should I have just woken her up?<br /> <br />Various scenarios rapidly unfolded in my mind. But carrying her was still the optimal solution for me.<br /> <br />I gently let Hanazono stand on the ground. She must be angry. Contrary to my expectations, Hanazono spoke calmly.<br /> <br />“…It’s fine.”<br /> <br />“But, Hanazono seems angry.”<br /> <br />“I’m not angry. …Ugh, I can’t stay the same as before. …It’s just… I was embarrassed.”<br /> <br />“R-Really? The previous Hanazono would have been furious.”<br /> <br />“That’s because the previous Hanazono was embarrassed too, dummy!”<br /> <br />Indeed, I didn’t sense anger from Hanazono. Her face turned a bit red, and she mumbled. That expression on Hanazono’s face was from times she felt happy.<br /> <br />“Enough. Let’s go home quickly.”<br /> <br />Hanazono started walking, turning away.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At that moment, I suddenly felt nostalgic. Words emerged from my invisible memories—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“W-Wait, Hana-chan—”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono turned around in surprise. I felt like those words weren’t mine. It was a tone as if I were a child.<br /> <br />“Do you remember?”<br /> <br />“N-No, those words just came out. …Sorry. I don’t know why I called you ‘Hana-chan.'”<br /> <br />“I see. Let’s go, Tsuyoshi.”<br /> <br />Hanazono’s gaze seemed to be looking at someone other than me.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />On the way home, our conversation dwindled. Our pace naturally slowed.<br /> <br />I thought I failed at the last moment, but it’s a relief. It was a bit regrettable to part like this. Going out with Hanazono was a lot of fun.<br /> <br />I wished for more days like this.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–If only I were more normal.<br /> </p>



<p>Suddenly, guilt squeezed my chest.<br /> <br />If I were ordinary, Hanazono would be happier.<br /> <br />Why… couldn’t I understand… people’s hearts?<br /> <br />The voice in my heart suddenly shouted.<br /> <br />Conflicts arose that were unthinkable from my usual self.<br /> <br />Hanazono seemed to sense my abnormality and peered at my face.<br /> <br />“Hey, you okay? Your face…doesn’t look good.”<br /> <br />The words that there’s no problem didn’t come out.<br /> <br />I felt pathetic and regretful about my own existence.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“It would have been better…if I couldn’t reset.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I feel like my face is going to start sweating again. It’s okay, I can endure it. Enduring is my specialty. I’ve always, always endured. Enduring is a matter of habit. I can endure anything. So it’ll be fine this time too. If I take deep breaths, calm will return to my heart. I don’t want to ruin my precious date with Hanazono at the very end. I just have to force the sweat from my eyes to stop.<br /> <br />…Yet I can’t get it to stop. Why?<br /> <br />A soft sensation touched my back–<br /> <br />Hanazono gently patted my back.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“It’s okay, it’s okay. –Tsuyoshi won’t change even if you reset. Your important memories will surely remain. …And you’ve grown properly! …See, I’ll be by your side–things will go well with Tanaka san too!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My chest hurt.<br /> <br />It was different from that time’s pain.<br /> <br />It wasn’t the pain of being hurt. It was pain I had created.<br /> <br />Thinking that I had hurt Hanazono because of me pained my heart. If I had been normal, that never would have happened. That thought makes my heart ache. An extraordinary pain.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono earnestly rubbed my back. The spot where her hand touched felt warm. The pain seemed to be soothed.<br /> <br />I forced out my voice, ignoring the pain.<br /> <br />“Hanazono–“<br /> <br />“What? You don’t feel good? Are you okay? “<br /> <br />I took out the package from my bag. Until now, birthdays had been unimportant to me. Because it wasn’t a special day to me. I realized on my own that Hanazono’s birthday was a special thing.<br /> <br />So I secretly bought this–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Your birthday already passed but please accept this.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The movement of Hanazono’s facial expressions stopped. Her body shook a little. Her eyes looked damp, it wasn’t my imagination.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />See reality. Reflect on your actions. Infer the other person’s feelings. Step into Hanazono’s heart–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hanazono is my precious friend. –Thank you…for always being there, since long ago. That’s how I feel.”<br /> <br />Hanazono took the present with shaking hands and unwrapped it.<br /> <br />When the strap came out, she covered her mouth with her hand.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Tsuyoshi…I, hic…I remembered the birthday. I didn’t say anything because I thought you forgot again… So that’s why, hic, you…Tsuyoshi…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“No, I didn’t want to make you cry. I wanted to make you happy–“<br /> <br />Seeing the blubbering me, Hanazono laughed.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…Idiot…wrong. I’m crying because I’m happy, so happy. Tsuyoshi, thank you. I’ll treasure this forever.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I couldn’t take my eyes off Hanazono–<br /> <br />I could tell my heart was racing and my body temperature was rising.<br /> <br />Because Hanazono’s smile was so incredibly beautiful–<br /> <br />My self-deprecating heart was sealed away, and for some reason I wanted to hug Hanazono.<br /> <br />My body moved on its own.<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />But hugging her would be too embarrassing so–I took Hanazono’s hand and started walking–somehow, it felt like long ago. I don’t remember but it must be hidden in my memories.<br /> <br />“Hurry up and stop crying, Hanazono.”<br /> <br />“Idiot, you’re the one crying.”<br /> <br />“I’m not crying. This is sweat.”<br /> <br />“What are you saying. Honestly…”<br /> <br />While looking at the strap and held hand happily, Hanazono smiled at me. Despite the different distance between us than before, I definitely felt like we had progressed somehow.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15: Seriously Aiming to be Normal</h3>



<p> <br />In the elementary school classroom, I made a friend – a dog. When I petted its head, it would wag its tail happily. We ran around and played together. We even ate our meals together.<br /> <br />The adults watched us with delight.<br /> <br />I thought I had finally made my first friend. But then, the dog left me behind and disappeared. I searched all around the school but couldn’t find it anywhere. My chest ached. I thought we would be together forever, but… I couldn’t bear the sadness anymore…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I reset my emotions.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />I felt strangely numb. I was walking to school in the morning. Hanazono and Tanaka were on either side of me. Recently, the three of us have been going to and from school together a lot. It’s a lively and fun commute.<br /> <br />“Hanazono-san, see you later! At the company tour, please look after Toudou for me!”<br /> <br />“Oh right, Tanaka-san doesn’t have to go since you’re in the special class. See you at lunch break!”<br /> <br />Hanazono and I saw off Tanaka’s back as she headed to a different school building.<br /> <br />Come to think of it, Hanazono and Tanaka interacted like they had been friends for a long time already.<br /> <br />“Hey, Tsuyoshi, let’s go to class,”<br /> <br />“Yeah…”<br /> <br />“What’s wrong? You don’t sound very energetic,” she remarked.<br /> <br />As I touched the haircut Hanazono had given me, I glanced around. It feels nice to touch my new hairstyle.<br /> <br />For some reason, the female students of the academy were buzzing excitedly. The amount of stares I’ve been getting has grown tremendously since the other day. It’s almost scary.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Woah, is that guy the rumored one?”<br /> <br />“Yeah yeah, he’s super hot!”<br /> <br />“He’s close friends with Tanaka-san from the special class. They look great together.”<br /> <br />“Is he an idol or something?”<br /> <br />“But you know, I’ve never seen him before right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah yeah, and he’s tall with a nice figure. He can’t be a model?”<br /> <br />“Someone should go talk to him!”<br /> <br />“Ehh, he’s hot but he looks cold. Scary!”<br /> <br />I understand their chatter is about me. …I’ve never been called hot before. They must be mistaken about something. It’s best to ignore strangers’ words. Misunderstandings can arise otherwise.<br /> <br />Hanazono always makes a strange expression at times like this. I can’t tell if she’s happy or angry – it’s an awkward look.<br /> <br />“Hanazono. What exactly is going on with our surroundings?” I asked.<br /> <br />“You wouldn’t understand. I’ll explain it to you properly later. More importantly, we’ll be late if we don’t hurry to class!” Hanazono trotted off, so I also headed to the classroom.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />After parting with Hanazono, I entered my own classroom. Here too, I sensed odd stares.<br /> <br />Lately, I feel like my school life is going smoothly. Of course, I’m alone most of the time, but unlike before, I can have conversations with students other than Hanazono.<br /> <br />In the past, it was just Hanazono and me – our world was complete with the two of us. Now it’s different. Like this morning, I’m also deepening my interactions with Tanaka.<br /> <br />But why does my heart beat slightly faster when Tanaka is around? …I should ask Hanazono about it later.<br /> <br />I mentally shut out my classmates’ chatter. I pretend not to hear even though I do hear it. That way, I won’t have any strange reactions or cause problems.<br /> <br />Extra words tend to lead to misunderstandings. It’s from experience.<br /> <br />With so many eyes on me, I’m starting to feel anxious. I should confirm the reason with Hanazono.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />When I got to my seat, Sasaki-san softly greeted me.<br /> <br />“Oh, good morning, Toudou-kun. R-reading some novel?”<br /> <br />I’m having a normal conversation with a classmate. It’s great progress for me.<br /> <br />I see, common hobbies expand the conversation.<br /> <br />On Sasaki-san’s recommendation, I started reading novels. Stories in novels, movies, and manga tend to be difficult for me, so I had avoided them before. Reading academic papers was simpler.<br /> <br />But like with the movie last time, decoding a narrative is interesting. While I have trouble understanding the feelings of characters, I can learn their patterns.<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’m properly reading through it. I plan to read this book today,”<br /> <br />I said, taking out a book from my bag to show Sasaki-san. I don’t need to carry books around since I have an eidetic memory and can instantly recall the words. However, slowly tracing the letters on a physical book provides a different sensation. So I bring real books with me.<br /> <br />“Oh, that’s Ken-sensei’s new work. Sensei is known for portraying emotions well,”<br /> <br />“Yeah, the first-person perspective makes it easy to understand the feelings of the uncle protagonist.”<br /> <br />“It’s hardboiled but easy to read, right?”<br /> <br />“Sasaki-san, what kind of book are you reading now?” I asked.<br /> <br />“Me? Well–“<br /> <br />Before she could continue, Sasaki-san’s friends came over.<br /> <br />“Miki~, good morning! Oh, rare to see you chatting with Toudou-kun– “<br /> <br />“Miki, I brought that coupling book you wanted! I’ll give it to you later, ‘kay?”<br /> <br />“Oh, thanks…I’ll take it later…”<br /> <br />While I can talk one-on-one with Sasaki-san, I haven’t spoken to her friends before.<br /> <br />I feel uncomfortable. Sasaki-san continues conversing with her friends.<br /> <br />I started reading the book in my hands. That way, I don’t have to talk.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hey, Toudou-kun, you know…”<br /> <br />“Miki-sa~, there’s no club activities today, right? Let’s go somewhere after school!”<br /> <br />“I’d love karaoke! Miki, you’re into Vocaloid, right?”<br /> <br />Karaoke, huh? Come to think of it, I’ve never actually been. I can sing songs from the choir competition at school. I can even sing the school anthem. What’s the point of singing?<br /> <br />I’m reading a book, but the content just won’t stick in my head. Why is the protagonist so self-deprecating? Is alcohol really that delicious? Why does he simmer stew so obsessively?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“And you know Toudou-kun, I’m also reading that book! I’m unexpectedly into books, you know?”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Is she talking to me? Or is she talking to Sasaki-san? I couldn’t tell. In times like this–it’s best to retreat into my shell.<br /> <br />“Huh? Did I say something unpleasant? M-Miki~”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san tapped my desk and looked at me perplexedly. What does she mean by that?<br /> <br />“Toudou-kun, Fujie-chan was talking to you,”<br /> <br />When I lifted my head, my classmate Fujie-san had an awkward expression – one I’m used to seeing.<br /> <br />“S-Sorry. I didn’t think you were addressing me,”<br /> <br />“Ah, no, it’s fine! I mean, I was surprised Sasaki-san and Toudou-kun can chat normally now! You never talk and I only hear weird rumors, so I thought, wow you can actually talk normally!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I also got to know him through Igarashi-kun. Toudou-kun isn’t weird at all. He’s very kind to Hanazono-san – when I see those two together, it makes me blush!”<br /> <br />“Hmm, so those were just groundless rumors from Rokka huh. That’s just like her to bully the boy she likes~. Speaking of which, Miki is always with Igarashi-kun right? Aren’t you two sus~~?”<br /> <br />“Ehh!? I-Igarashi-kun is just…my track club teammate…”<br /> <br />I tried to find a way to enter the conversation. Talking to strangers is scary. But I promised Hanazono I would move forward.<br /> <br />Besides, they are Sasaki-san’s friends. Surely they can’t be bad people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> <br />“Igarashi-kun cares deeply for Sasaki-san. The changes in his body temperature and emotions when talking to Sasaki-san are obvious.”<br /> <br />“W-Wait, Toudou-kun! That’s embarrassing…”<br /> <br />“Hahaha!! Seriously! By the way, is Toudou…actually an amusing guy?”<br /> <br />“Me? I’m just an ordinary guy.”<br /> <br />Ordinary… I know that I’m just an aberration trying to become normal.<br /> <br />I’ve been given a proposal by my homeroom teacher about that. I need to make a decision soon.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Just as I was thinking about this, the teacher entered the classroom.<br /> <br />Fujie-san and the others said goodbye to Sasaki-san and left.<br /> <br />Sasaki-san’s face was a little red, but she didn’t seem to mind.<br /> <br />I felt a warm fuzziness in my chest for some reason. It reminded me of the youth novel I read before.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />During morning homeroom, the teacher started explaining the upcoming work experience field trip<br /> </p>



<p>an extracurricular event for the whole grade.<br /> <br />We’ll be visiting companies to see and experience the kinds of work they do, then write a report afterwards. It’s very interesting content.<br /> <br />I can’t picture myself working at a company in the future. I have a vague anxiety about the future.<br /> <br />There are several companies accepting students, so we have to decide which one we want to visit in groups by class.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Grouping up… For me, it brings back many bitter memories.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In middle school, Hanazono helped me out during class events. She looked after me since I had trouble getting along with classmates. But even Hanazono has her own female friends to spend time with, so I was completely alone when we weren’t in the same class.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />During any class event, making groups for something, picking partners for P.E., deciding work allocations for the culture festival… I was always left out. The teacher would tell me to join a group with fewer people. When that happened, I strongly felt I was an aberration. I can’t forget my classmates’ disgusted faces.<br /> <br />A bothersome thing. That term fit me perfectly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Come to think of it, Hanazono really liked that phone strap.<br /> <br />…I’m trying to escape reality by thinking about Hanazono.<br /> <br />Neither Hanazono nor Tanaka are in this class.<br /> <br />…It’ll be alright. A bit lonely, but if I get placed in a leftover spot and act alone on the day itself, there’ll be no issues. I’m used to being alone. Being able to endure means being used to it.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Alright, go ahead and randomly make the groups. Students who are done, write your names on the board. Class rep, I’ll leave the rest to you,” the teacher said before exiting the classroom.<br /> <br />Our class rep Michiba Rokka stood at the front in the teacher’s place. The long homeroom period was beginning.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Okay everyone, first form groups with your friends! We’ll adjust from there!”<br /> <br />It seemed everyone had decided their groups beforehand. At Rokka’s signal, the representatives headed to the board and started writing down names.<br /> <br />“Uhh, can’t read that guy’s kanji. Oi, come up here and write it yourself!”<br /> <br />“Me, Miyo-chan, and Kasuga-kun…”<br /> <br />“Crap, aren’t we too many? You’re good friends with that other group right? Why not join them?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, they’ve got more girls. Tsuyoshi have fun!”<br /> <br />“Nice, enjoy yourself!”<br /> <br />It was as if time had frozen around just me.<br /> <br />I couldn’t move from my seat. I didn’t know what to do. I felt an intense sense of isolation…<br /> <br />I like the cheerful, lively atmosphere, but I don’t feel like joining in.<br /> </p>





<p> <br />–It’s always like this. If I endure, the painful time will pass.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The writing on the board filled up. Everyone’s name was listed except mine.<br /> <br />“Yo, class rep, it’s pretty much decided right?”<br /> <br />“Split up nicely~”<br /> <br />“Yeah, so all that’s left is Toudou. Umm, what should we do? Drawing lots like last time?”<br /> <br />My chest leapt at Rokka-san’s words.<br /> <br />I have to join the neatly divided groups.<br /> <br />My classmates don’t want an aberration inserted into their group. I strongly sensed their rejection.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Drawing lots. It’s a method to evenly distribute me among groups.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Last time too, it was by drawing lots. The student who got me looked frustrated. To my classmates, I’m the losing draw. At the time, it didn’t particularly bother me.<br /> <br />But now, after becoming friends with Hanazono–after becoming friends with Tanaka–<br /> <br />My heart has changed a little.<br /> <br />It’s true I’m alone. I don’t want to inconvenience the other students. More than that, I’ve made people who call me their friend.<br /> <br />I raised my hand.<br /> <br />The class was buzzing and no one noticed.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“So Toudou-kun. Hey, why not join our group? I’ll tell my friends too. Igarashi-kun will be joining us later too.”<br /> <br />I could tell Sasaki-san had been worrying about me this whole time.<br /> <br />If she arbitrarily added me to her group based on her own judgment, it might cause problems in her relationships. Just her offer is enough.<br /> <br />This is due to my own negligence in building proper human relationships.<br /> <br />“Thank you, Sasaki-san. Just give me a moment–“<br /> <br />–Sasaki-san is a good person. She’s a perfect match for Igarashi-kun. I hope they remain friends.<br /> <br />I’ve decided to move forward. With my own will, through my own actions–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I dislike being the center of attention. But more than that… I dislike even more being dead weight because of drawing lots.<br /> <br />“You don’t like drawing lots either? Geez, then I guess Toudou has to join my group–“<br /> <br />I interrupted Rokka-san’s words.<br /> <br />“Rokka, why don’t we not do the drawing? I’ll decide by my own will.”<br /> <br />Rokka-san looked confused for a moment, then heaved a huge sigh. An ominous atmosphere spread through the classroom as it fell silent.<br /> <br />“Toudou…don’t be selfish okay? No one wants you in their group, that’s why. Don’t make me say it aloud…honestly…it’s why you don’t have any friends.”<br /> <br />“Indeed, that’s fair. However–“<br /> <br />Sasaki-san started to say “W-wait, our group–” but I gestured for her to stop. Saying that would make her an object of curiosity in the classroom. Don’t impose on others what you wouldn’t want imposed on yourself.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I’ll be fine alone.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Huh? What are you saying? It’s a class event! Don’t be so selfish, I can’t tolerate it! Hey, let’s ask everyone! Guys~, do you want Toudou in your groups?”<br /> <br />The students who went to karaoke with Rokka immediately spoke up.<br /> <br />“Woah, Rokka-chan~ that’s kinda mean…”<br /> <br />“Way too pushy, your joke didn’t land well.”<br /> <br />“Anyway, why would we deal with an gloomy loner?”<br /> <br />“Does he still not get that he’s hated? Annoying as hell.”<br /> <br />Amidst the loud voices, I could also hear the few trying to speak up for me.<br /> <br />“I don’t mind him in my group.”<br /> <br />“He’s a bit scary but could join my group too–“<br /> <br />“I…”<br /> <br />As Sasaki-san tried to speak, I quieted her with my hand.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I see, it does seem I’m not very well-liked. Of course, I understand some students are speaking up for me… Forcing unwilling students to include someone they aren’t friends with is clearly problematic. In that case, I’ll be fine alone.”<br /> <br />“Geez…you’re not listening right? The company tour requires moving in groups.”<br /> <br />Rokka-san sighed but for some reason looked at me coquettishly.<br /> <br />“–If you hate drawing lots that much, th-then just join my group! It’s fine!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It’s not that I hate drawing lots. Or being alone. What I hate is not being able to decide things for myself–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I started walking towards the front.<br /> <br />I heard Rokka-san’s sharp inhale.<br /> <br />“…Oh, you finally understand right? Hehe, sensei is so mean–“<br /> <br />I picked up a piece of chalk.</p>
