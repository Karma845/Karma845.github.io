<h1>Chapter 2: My Childhood Friend Is a VTuber, but Is It Okay to Support Her?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Alright, that’s all for today—Phew, I’m tired…” (Keisuke) </p>



<p>After concluding the stream with those words, I leaned back in my chair, exhaling deeply. </p>



<p>Although I managed to get through my first stream after going viral, I was tense from start to finish. <br /></p>



<p>After all, until now, I had only had one or two simultaneous viewers, but this time the number skyrocketed to five digits. The contrast was so overwhelming that it made me dizzy… <br /></p>



<p>Of course, all of the viewers came after hearing about me from Yukina, and honestly, I was so overwhelmed that I couldn’t fully comprehend the situation. <br /></p>



<p>There were various types of viewers—People who praised my skills, people who were skeptical about me, and people who casually tuned in because of all the buzz. <br /></p>



<p>During the entire stream, I was determined not to let Yukina down after all the support she gave me, so I pushed myself to work harder than usual. <br /></p>



<p>“Well, in any case, I’m relieved it ended without any issues.” (Keisuke) </p>



<p>I sighed in relief and decided to check the archive of the stream I just finished. <br /></p>



<p>The number of views had already surpassed ten thousand, and there were numerous <br />comments. <br /></p>



<p>…Seriously, it feels like a completely different world from just yesterday. </p>



<p>Not soon after, I came across the name “wankoromochi” right away. </p>



<p>Not only has she been commenting non-stop during the stream, but she was still among the first to comment on the archive. </p>



<p>Realizing once again that I was strongly endorsed by Yukina, my face couldn’t help but break into a grin. <br /></p>



<p>However, the moment I saw the replies to her comment, my body tensed up involuntarily. <br /></p>



<p>Comment: [This wankoromochi person has been commenting before this guy blew up. Maybe this person is Yukina, lol.] <br /></p>



<p>“That’s bad…!” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>A cold sweat started to trickle down.</p>



<p>Well, I think this comment was probably written as a joke, right? Even though that’s what I believe, their assumption still hit the mark causing me to get uneasy.</p>



<p>If they find out that Yukina is indeed commenting all this time, it would undoubtedly cause another buzz once past comments start to get dug up. It would definitely cause problems for Yukina. I need to do something about this…</p>



<p>“Well, for now, I guess I’ll try asking her to comment less.” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>While planning to convey this to her at school later, I closed the archive and decided to turn my attention to something else.</p>



<p>Now that the stream has safely ended, it’s time to take a breather. Later today, there’s a stream from the incredibly popular VTuber, Daitenin Mariel-sama. Let’s just unwind by watching that.</p>



<p>Mariel-sama’s calm voice and manner of speaking are genuinely soothing. Despite that, during live commentary, she can be quite wild, mixing in a bit of banter with a moderate amount of poison during casual chats. What I’m trying to say is that she’s pretty good at talking. And also, she has various cute moments whenever she messes up. Her reaction when she confidently declared victory in a puzzle game stream only to realize she messed up and lost was entertaining.</p>



<p>…Ahh, Mariel-sama’s cute flustered moments during that time were seriously like a national treasure. I got so caught up in it that I impulsively bought her merchandise even though I already had some.</p>



<p>I also like the adult-like appearance of her character, and the gap between that and her occasional cute side was charming. I can watch Mariel-sama’s streams for hours; they’re just so fun. Just like Yukina, it’s become an essential nutrient for me. Since yesterday’s stream was suddenly canceled, I’m feeling starved for Mariel-sama’s content, so today, I’ll make sure to consume it to my heart’s content.</p>



<p id="no1">“Mariel-sama, I wonder what she’s planning to do in today’s stream. I’m looking forward to it! That being said… hmm, there’s still some time before it starts. Maybe I’ll check my <a href="#footnote">DMs<sup>1</sup></a> to pass the time.” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>Unable to wait for the stream to start, I decided to distract myself by organizing my DMs, which I hadn’t touched ever since the buzz. As expected, there was quite a lot (probably all related to Yukina), and just at that moment when I was contemplating what to do with all the DMs, a new DM arrived.</p>



<p>…But, upon seeing the sender’s name, I couldn’t help but let out a surprised “Huh?”</p>



<p>Daitenin Mariel (@Mariel_fallen)──</p>



<p>“Mariel… eh? Mariel-sama?” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>Suddenly, the name of a familiar VTuber popped up, and I found myself rubbing my eyes in disbelief.</p>



<p id="no2">At first, I naturally thought it might be a prank or impersonation, but because the <a href="#footnote">handler<sup>2</sup></a> felt familiar, I decided to cross-check with the official account just to be sure, and lo and behold, it was a match.</p>



<p>Despite my disbelief, I decided to check the contents of the DM. There, I found an invitation expressing a desire to collaborate with me.</p>



<p id="no3">The message was written in the same refined “<a href="#footnote">desu wa<sup>3</sup></a>” tone as Mariel-sama. It began with an apology for the sudden DM and ended with a polite invitation asking if I would be interested in joining her in today’s upcoming LoF (Line of Fire) stream.</p>



<p>“A collab with Mariel-sama!? N-No way, something like that…!” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>I double-checked the account again, and it was indeed a match. If that’s the case, I had no choice but to believe it was real, but I still couldn’t quite wrap my head around it.</p>



<p>Mariel-sama isn’t just a regular celebrity. She’s practically a legend. Among the numerous VTubers out there, Mariel-sama set a massive record by reaching millions of subscribers within just a month of her debut. Truly deserving of the title of a legend.</p>



<p id="no4">I’ve been following her since her first stream, and I still can’t forget the impact it had. During her <a href="#footnote">debut</a><a href="#footnote"><sup>4</sup></a>, Mariel-sama introduced herself as a fallen angel expelled from heaven because she loved otaku culture, especially games. Her background, design, and personality itself complemented each other so well that it instantly captivated many people.</p>



<p>Of course, I, too, was captivated by Mariel-sama. I found myself getting absorbed into her streams and before I knew it, I had not only subscribed to her channel but also become a member. Since then, I’ve continued to support Mariel-sama, and well, she’s just too cute! I’ve been pushed to my limits by her so many times…!</p>



<p>Something like this hadn’t happened to me ever since I found out about Yukina, so it was genuinely shocking.</p>



<p>If someone were to ask me whether I prefer Yukina or Mariel-sama, that would be a stupid question. An incredibly stupid question.</p>



<p>You can’t compare the two. They’re both the best in their own field! Yukina and Mariel-sama stand side by side in my heart! Both of them are my favorite oshis, and there’s no one over the other. I’ve even distributed my budget equally to support both of them, though managing it was incredibly challenging.</p>



<p>…Well, I got a bit carried away there, but I want you to understand how passionately I support Mariel-sama. She has the kind of charm that shook my heart, even though Yukina was already my oshi. She has also captivated the hearts of many and now reigns at the top of the VTuber world.</p>



<p>So, what I’m trying to say is, why is such a prominent figure inviting me?</p>



<p>“…Let’s just ask her for now—wait, already!?” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>As I replied to the DM just to confirm her invitation, the response came back in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>…Isn’t this way too fast? It’s almost like the speed of a bot…</p>



<p>I had sent a message roughly asking if she was the real Mariel-sama, and how was the collaboration going to work.</p>



<p>In response, she assured me that she was the real Mariel, apologized for the suddenness, and mentioned that for now, I didn’t have to voice chat with her. Just playing together would be fine.</p>



<p id="no5">The last part included instructions to send a friend request, along with the LoF account ID and <a href="#footnote">password<sup>5</sup></a> and I stared at it intently.</p>



<p>This ID looks familiar… It’s actually her?!</p>



<p>I immediately launched LoF and, with trembling hands, entered the ID and password.</p>



<p>And then came the prompt, “Do you want to send a friend request and form a party?” and without hesitation, I clicked ‘Yes’—</p>



<p>“N-No way!? So, it’s really…!” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>On the lobby screen, next to my hero, the ‘Shadow Hunter’, stood Mariel-sama’s main hero ‘Dark Wing’. Above it was the genuine ID of Mariel-sama, the same one I had seen multiple times during her streams.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [I’m glad we could form a party. Thank you for accepting the sudden invitation, Kei-sama.]</p>



<p>Without a moment to soak in the surprise, a message appeared in the chat, and I had no choice but to finally accept the reality.</p>



<p>“Whoa!? It’s the real Mariel-sama!? W-Wait, she invited me to a party…! W-Wow!?” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>I quickly reached my limit at the fact that I had been directly invited by my oshi VTuber.</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the situation, I felt the urge to jump around my room in excitement. However, I remembered that I hadn’t replied so I hastily tapped on the keyboard.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Kei)</strong>: [T-Thank you for inviting me for this collaboration.]</p>



<p>My face heated up as I noticed the apparent signs of my nervousness in the message.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [I originally wanted to invite Kei-sama more formally, but a lot of things ended up happening all of a sudden, so I want to apologize for that.]</p>



<p>But Mariel-sama didn’t seem bothered at all and continued to reply politely.</p>



<p>…Ahhh, what should I do!? Am I really having a conversation with Mariel-sama!? Is it even okay for something like this to happen in reality!? Oh, man, I feel like I’m breaking out into a weird sweat!!</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by happiness, my emotions were on the verge of going haywire. However, I couldn’t expose such an embarrassing side to Mariel-sama, so I made an effort to calm down and replied.</p>



<p>There were many things I wanted to talk about, but there wasn’t much time left until the stream started. So, I hastily confirmed what to do during the stream for now.</p>



<p>Since I wouldn’t be directly to her, she’ll handle the streaming part, and I just need to play the game as how I normally would.</p>



<p>…Phew, that’s a relief. If that’s the case, I can definitely manage it. Despite being overwhelmed by this sudden turn of events, for Mariel-sama’s sake, I’ll concentrate on the game as instructed… Oh, right, there’s one more thing to do before that.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Kei)</strong>: [Why did you decide to collaborate with me? If you don’t mind, I’d like to know the reason.]</p>



<p>With trembling hands, I managed to type and send that question.</p>



<p>It was something that had been on my mind for a while. While I’ve known about Mariel-sama for a long time, we had no actual connection.</p>



<p>So, I was genuinely curious about how Mariel-sama came to know about me. After a while, I received a response.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [Because of the Yukina Nozomi-san incident yesterday.]</p>



<p>…I see, that makes sense. There’s probably no other way for my existence to be known.</p>



<p>I nodded in understanding. Somehow, I felt like the response took a bit longer than usual (and the wording seemed a bit blunt), but maybe Mariel-sama is busy preparing for the stream. That must be it.</p>



<p>“The impact of Yukina’s buzz sure is incredible.” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>Without dwelling on it too much, I marveled at the strength of Yukina’s influence. Just as Mariel-sama messaged that the stream would start soon and she would be away from the chat, I quickly prepared my smartphone.</p>



<p>Since I’m playing LoF on my PC, I’ll watch the stream on my phone instead… As I opened Mariel-sama’s channel, the stream was already live.</p>



<p>“(Good day, it’s Mariel <em>desu wa</em>. Now, the banquet of Daitenin Mariel is about to begin. Everyone, are you ready to be ruined?)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Soon, the main event started, and along with the usual greeting, Mariel-sama made her appearance.</p>



<p>She has long silver hair and black wings on her back. On top of that, she also had a charming expression on her face, and, inevitably for any man, attention was drawn to her ample bosom. Speaking in a refined “<em>desu wa</em>” tone like a young lady, this person was none other than the immensely popular VTuber, Daitenin Mariel.</p>



<p>“Wow, seriously, that’s me, isn’t it!?” (Keisuke)</p>



<p>At that moment, I was on the screen of my oshi VTuber’s channel.</p>



<p>The screen showed the LoF lobby, and there I was, standing next to Mariel-sama!</p>



<p>Oh no, it feels amazing to be in the stream of my oshi like this…!</p>



<p>People might mock me, saying I do my own game commentary, so why am I getting so emotional? But this is completely different! It’s incredible to appear on Mariel-sama’s channel! It’s only natural to be moved by this!</p>



<p>“(Now, we’ll be playing LoF, but we have a special collaboration with a surprise guest. That guest is already on screen, and as you can see, it’s the trending game commentator, Kei-sama from Kei’s Game Commentary Channel <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Mariel-sama is introducing me…! I don’t know how to describe this feeling; My body is squirming uncontrollably!?</p>



<p>While enduring the overwhelming excitement, I managed to check the comments of the stream on my smartphone.</p>



<p>Among the viewers, some were genuinely excited about the collaboration, while others had reactions like ‘Who?’ or ‘I don’t know him’ or ‘I think he went viral yesterday.’ It was a diverse range of responses.</p>



<p>Well, that’s to be expected. Even I would question why if someone told me that they were collaborating with someone I’d never heard of before.</p>



<p>“(Kei-sama’s LoF skills are quite impressive. So today, the plan is to play ranked matches while getting carried by Kei-sama.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>As expected of a fallen angel. She’s devilishly charming. She even makes it sound like she’s been watching me.</p>



<p>…Alright, I can’t embarrass myself in front of Mariel-sama. I’ll do my best to carry her!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>While watching the livestream, my motivation is soaring like never before.</p>



<p>“(Well then, let’s get started.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>With those words, Mariel-sama started the matchmaking queue.</p>



<p>We immediately found a match, and since there were only two of us, a third random person joined our team to fill up the last slot. After selecting our respective heroes, the match begins shortly. Alright, here we go!</p>



<p>“(Now, as for the map… Looks like it’s going to be Night Forest this time.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Night Forest, huh? As you can tell from the name, it’s a literal nighttime forest map.</p>



<p>The entire map is dark with thick vegetation, making player detection and positional awareness essential to winning. Generally, sniper rifles are effective on this map with sensor equipment, but close-quarters gears should be prioritized towards the end of the game when the map starts to shrink.</p>



<p>While thinking about such things, we descend from the dropship.</p>



<p>This time, Mariel-sama takes charge of the descent and marks an area on the map. Mariel-sama, who has also streamed LoF before, is quite skilled at the game. The descent went smoothly and we didn’t encounter any enemies in our area. We’re off to quite a decent start.</p>



<p>Each of us proceeds to collect nearby equipment at our respective landing spots. In LoF, everyone starts the game unarmed, and equipment can be gathered from chests located all over the map. The contents of all the chests are random, so luck plays a strong role during the game. Personally, I think that’s what makes each game interesting.</p>



<p>“(Yes! I got an RG105!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Even though we’re not using the in-game voice chat, I can hear Mariel-sama’s happy voice through the stream.</p>



<p>Looks like she managed to get her favorite weapon. How lucky.</p>



<p>After both the random player and I looted the nearby chests, we promptly moved away from our landing area. Since we’re quite close to the border, it’s best to move away before time runs out unless there’s a specific reason to stay.</p>



<p>“(Oh, I heard something just now! It’s coming from two o’clock <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>As Mariel-sama speaks, I can indeed hear gunshots going off in the direction we are currently heading.</p>



<p>It seems like enemy squads are engaging each other, but…</p>



<p>“(This is our chance <em>desu wa</em>! Let’s clean up the fight!)”</p>



<p>Saying so, Mariel-sama starts moving towards them, but just before that, I use a ping to stop her. Even without voice chat, pings can be used as a form of communication.</p>



<p>“(What’s wrong, Kei-sama?)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>I stop Mariel-sama and use a ping to indicate that there’s another squad in the area.</p>



<p>Actually, a moment ago, I briefly saw a figure on top of the hill to the right. There’s probably another squad, like us, trying to take advantage of the ongoing battle.</p>



<p>We decide to stop and lay low for now. Gunshots subside for a moment, and after a while, different gunshots are heard. It seems that the aforementioned squad waiting to clean up the fight has made their move.</p>



<p>…This is our chance.</p>



<p>“(I see, this is what it means to ambush the ambusher.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>We quickly join in on the chaos and approach the two squads that are currently engaged. Having been distracted by their initial fight, we were able to easily clean them up.</p>



<p>“(We did it! Look at the armor this guy had, he was rich <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>While looting items from the defeated enemies, I remain vigilant to the surroundings.</p>



<p>…There’s no one else around. We had a planned escape route in case enemies arrived, but looks like it wasn’t necessary.</p>



<p>I eased up a little and quickly picked up the dropped loot. Among them, I picked up my favorite weapon, the 777 Magnum. This weapon is powerful but has a long firing interval and a low ammo count, making it a somewhat quirky weapon. Although it is often categorized as a weak weapon in general, I like the feel of it and would always use it if I could.</p>



<p>After grabbing all the loot and checking the remaining number of squads, there were only about ten squads left. The game started with thirty squads, so the game was progressing quite rapidly this time. It seems everyone is engaging in intense battles, and those who remain are likely formidable opponents.</p>



<p>Since we’re already away from the border, there’s no need to move from our current location, so we just maintain vigilance of our surroundings.</p>



<p>While we were in the midst of this, the number of remaining squads continued to decrease, and when there were only four squads left, we finally entered the end game. With the field continuously shrinking, we were being forced towards our enemies.</p>



<p>“(…Let’s go. The border is closing in.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Following Mariel-sama’s words, we leap out from the building where we were hiding.</p>



<p>But at that moment, footsteps can be heard from our left, and gunfire erupts through the trees.</p>



<p>“(Enemies <em>desu wa</em>! Everyone, fight back!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>While being chased by the closing border, gunshots continue to echo through the forest. At the same time, I could hear gunfire from another location, indicating that the other two squads were also engaged in a fight.</p>



<p>I managed to take down one enemy while running. Swiftly turning around, I shot down the enemy who was confronting Mariel-sama from behind.</p>



<p>“(Thank you, Kei-sama! …Ah, the random player!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>At that moment, a report comes in that the random player’s teammate has been downed, a bit delayed.</p>



<p>Looking back, the random player probably got stuck at the border. I spot an enemy running towards us from the border, so Mariel-sama and I simultaneously open fire and eliminate him.</p>



<p>“…Damn, there’s no time to save him. We’re gonna have to do this without him.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“(I’m sorry for the random player-san! We will definitely win!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Normally, when someone is down, they can be revived by a nearby teammate, but if that person is outside the border, it’s already too late.</p>



<p>It’s a painful decision, but Mariel-sama and I have no choice but to leave him behind. The notification of our teammate’s death appears, and our squad is reduced to just the two of us.</p>



<p>Checking the remaining squads, there were only two left, including us. In other words, the next battle would be the last one. It would be great if the enemy squad had also lost some members…</p>



<p>“(Kyah!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>However, in the next moment, a scream is heard, and Mariel-sama’s somehow went down.</p>



<p>…This is bad! Did we just run into an ambush!?</p>



<p>Quickly hiding in the shadows, I look towards Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>At that moment, I could see that the enemy squad was rapidly approaching us.</p>



<p>…They’re fast! And all three of them seem to be fully alive!</p>



<p>“(I, I apologize, Kei-sama! The enemies are heading your way!)”</p>



<p>While Mariel-sama wasn’t eliminated, she couldn’t move in her downed state.</p>



<p>A hopeless 1v3 situation. Normally, at this point, winning would be nearly impossible, but I couldn’t afford to give up.</p>



<p>“We’re in a collaboration with Mariel-sama! We can’t afford to lose!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, the situation remains overwhelmingly unfavorable. To turn the tide from here… I had to take a bit of risk!</p>



<p>I discard my main weapon, the SMG, and equip the 777 Magnum that I had been carrying as a secondary.</p>



<p>It might seem like a ridiculous move as if giving up, but in this situation, there were no other options left.</p>



<p>The footsteps draw closer. Based on the direction of the sound, I could estimate their position.</p>



<p>I swiftly jump out from the cover of the trees. Taking aim at the head of the first enemy I see and shoot him.</p>



<p><em>*Bakiiin!* </em></p>



<p>The sound of armor shattering echoes, and the enemy goes down.</p>



<p>This weapon’s headshot damage is ridiculous and can even piece through any armor with a single shot.</p>



<p>However, this gun is still a weak weapon. Its limitations are apparent. The interval between shots takes too long, leaving the wielder vulnerable during that duration. Indeed, the remaining two enemies took advantage of this and aimed their guns at me and the situation seemed hopeless… or so it should have been.</p>



<p>In the next moment, I rapidly tap the keyboard.</p>



<p>Frame-perfect inputs. I’ve practiced it many times, but the success rate in actual combat is around fifty percent.</p>



<p>But right now, I absolutely have to make it. After all, Mariel-sama is watching!</p>



<p>“(Eh!?)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>Simultaneously with Mariel-sama’s surprised voice, the sound of armor shattering in quick succession was heard.</p>



<p>There were only two gunshots. With those two shots, the remaining two enemies were down, and at the same time, the announcement declared the winners of the game.</p>



<p>Of course, the winners were us.</p>



<p>“(Ehhhhh?! W-What just happened!? He single-handedly wiped out the enemies! And it happened so fast too!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>From my smartphone, I hear the rare excitement in Mariel-sama’s voice.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I, leaning back in my chair, let out a big exhale, feeling drained.</p>



<p>“…<em>Haaa</em>. That was close… I managed to pull it off somehow.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Whether it was the intense concentration or the aftermath, my entire body felt heavy. The relief of not losing in front of Mariel-sama was more significant than the joy of winning.</p>



<p>…It was a close call, but I’m glad I didn’t embarrass myself in front of her.</p>



<p>I let out another sigh and immersed myself in the satisfaction of having overcome the challenge</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mariel-sama has been talking continuously on the stream.</p>



<p>“(Did everyone see that just now!? What a play from him! Landing three perfect headshots with the Magnum in a 1v3 situation for the win—there are no words to describe it other than amazing! How skilled can you be!?)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>“No, no, it’s not that impressive… well, maybe a bit! Ah, being praised like this by Mariel-sama, I’m so glad I did my best…! It’s too much, I’m so happy…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I relish the joy of being praised by oshi in my favorite game.</p>



<p>I wasn’t rolling around in excitement or anything because I was tired, but still, it felt great.</p>



<p>Because it’s Mariel-sama, you know? Being recognized by her, is there anything else you can ask for? I’m definitely going to save the archive of this stream forever.</p>



<p>Even as I was enjoying this pleasant feeling, Mariel-sama’s excitement showed no sign of waning. She continued to shower me with praise for my gameplay.</p>



<p>…However, this is the first time I’ve seen Mariel-sama with such high energy. Normally, she gives off a mature older sister vibe, but this cute side of her is also endearing. Yeah, I want to support her even more now.</p>



<p id="no1">Checking the <a href="#footnote">comments section<sup>1</sup></a>, it was also buzzing with excitement. I felt a renewed sense of relief that Mariel-sama didn’t end up embarrassing herself.</p>



<p>“(<em>Haaa</em>, Kei-sama is so cool…! As expected of the game commentator I looked up to <em>desu wa</em>! Well, I always believed that you could do it, Kei-sama! Today’s archive will definitely be preserved forever <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>…But still, isn’t Mariel-sama getting a bit too excited? She’s saying things that are surprisingly close to my own thoughts.</p>



<p id="no2">Seeing her transformed into what seemed like an extreme otaku, even the <a href="#footnote">fellow angels<sup>2</sup></a> in chat seemed to find her behavior strange and commented on it.</p>



<p>However, Mariel-sama calmly dropped a bomb in the midst of it all.</p>



<p id="imagetext">“(Of course, it’s natural to be excited! Actually, I’ve been a fan of Kei-sama for a long time <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>“Huh!? <em>*cough cough*</em>” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Upon this sudden bombshell statement, I involuntarily sat up and choked.</p>



<p>…W-What did she just say!? She’s my whaaat…!?</p>



<p>“(Actually, the purpose of this collaboration was to introduce my oshi, Kei-sama, to everyone! And when he shows off such divine gameplay, what else is there to say other than that Kei-sama is truly a god <em>desu wa</em>!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>“W… Wh…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t find any words. It’s true that when people are extremely surprised, they lose the ability to speak.</p>



<p>…Wait, is this the time to stay calm!? W-What is happening here!?</p>



<p>My oshi VTuber just came out and admitted to being a fan of mine who has been supporting me all this time—</p>



<p>No, this can’t be true! This is just like the Yukina incident from yesterday! What’s going on!?</p>



<p>I found the situation unbelievably surreal. However, Mariel-sama’s statements seemed to be no mistake, and the comments section was in chaos.</p>



<p>Comments like “I’ve never seen Mariel-sama like this before”, “Mariel-sama’s oshi is him?”, “Fanboying Mariel-sama is cute”, and “I envy him” flooded the chat.</p>



<p>“(Yes, it’s true <em>desu wa</em>. Everyone, please be sure to show some support to my number 1 oshi, Kei-sama’s gaming commentary channel. You can see other various god-tier plays in his archives, and don’t forget to subscribe to his channel!)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>“M-Mariel-sama is seriously promoting my channel…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Is this a dream? Could it be that I’ve focused too much on the game and damaged my brain’s blood vessels or something?</p>



<p>The Yuki incident was already unbelievable, but now Mariel-sama too? Is it really possible for such things to happen day after day? No, maybe all of this, including Yuki’s incident, is just a dream…</p>



<p>“O-Onii-chan…! What on earth is happening again…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>While lost in such thoughts of escaping the harsh reality, Sana burst into the room, slamming the door open. This scene felt like a déjà vu.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, you’re going viral on social media again…! This time, there’s even a trending keyword ‘Daitenin Mariel’…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Glancing at Sana’s smartphone screen, I could indeed see that both Mariel-sama and I were trending, and someone had already uploaded a highlight video of the recent game.</p>



<p>…Wait, isn’t Sana remarkably quick in her reactions too, or is it just my imagination…?</p>



<p>Sana pressed me for an explanation, but I was in no state to articulate anything comprehensible. I don’t know what’s happening anymore! Cut me some slack!</p>



<p>Eventually, Sana, grew impatient and left the room. Left alone, I reluctantly returned to Mariel-sama’s livestream. And then…</p>



<p>“(<em>Haaa</em>… I’m satisfied after watching Kei-sama’s gameplay today, so I apologize, but I’ll end the stream now… Eh? Yes, that’s right. I’m just too exhausted from going overboard just now <em>desu wa</em>. Well then, goodbye everyone.)” (Mariel)</p>



<p>With that, Mariel-sama abruptly ended the stream.</p>



<p>“But you’ve only played one game, and it’s only been like an hour…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I was left dumbfounded.</p>



<p>The stream was supposed to last around two hours, and yet, it ended just like that.</p>



<p>Maybe this is a dream after all? Despite such thoughts, I checked my channel, the view count was still increasing. The comment section was overflowing, not only with comments related to yesterday’s incident with Yuki but now also with remarks from viewers who have come from Mariel-sama. At this point, I had no choice but to acknowledge it.</p>



<p>Continuing from Yuki’s incident, now I was getting buzzed by Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>Moreover, just like with Yuki, she had been a fan of mine.</p>



<p>Being promoted by my oshi for two days in a row. What on earth is happening in this world?</p>



<p>…Well, yes, I am happy, there’s no doubt about that. After all, it’s natural considering that the other party is someone like Mariel-sama, but… Ah, come on! There’s just too much going on within such a short period of time!</p>



<p>Lost in such thoughts, I suddenly noticed my PC screen.</p>



<p>The LoF was still running, and a message appeared in the chat box on the lobby screen.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [Thank you very much for accepting my sudden invitation today and for showing such an amazing play.]</p>



<p>Of course, it was from Mariel-sama. I snapped back to reality and hastily replied, even though I didn’t know how to respond after what had just happened. Still, I had to express my gratitude, so I typed a reply with trembling hands.</p>



<p>Unlike the energetic tone in the stream, Mariel-sama’s message was calm and composed. I thought the conversation would end right there but then—</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [By the way, I apologize for my lack of manners, but I have a request for Kei-sama <em>desu</em>. Would you mind listening?]</p>



<p>Receiving such a sudden request, I tilted my head in confusion.</p>



<p>…Maybe it’s another invitation to collab?</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [Today’s collaboration made me even more of a fan of Kei-sama. If you don’t mind, I would like to meet you in real life. What do you think?]</p>



<p>“…………Eh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>To be honest, I initially thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I read that.</p>



<p>After all, the idea of meeting in real life is an incredibly high hurdle, especially for relationships that exist solely online. Moreover, the other party is a highly popular VTuber. It seemed like an utterly implausible story.</p>



<p>…However, the fact that I was actually being asked to meet in person was undeniable.</p>



<p>I felt quite perplexed. I was still trying to keep up with the fact that my oshi VTuber had endorsed me, and now, something even crazier was happening. I couldn’t fathom it at all.</p>



<p>“No, no, that’s not good…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I vigorously shook my head.</p>



<p>Of course, I couldn’t deny that I was curious about what kind of woman she might be in real life, considering she was the famous Daitenin Mariel. </p>



<p>Yet, even if there was an invitation from her, meeting the person in real life is different. I believed there were boundaries to be respected, especially when it came to the person behind the VTuber persona.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Kei)</strong>: [I appreciate the offer, but meeting in real life might pose various issues…]</p>



<p>So, I decided to decline Mariel-sama’s invitation. After all, she is someone from a completely different dimension, and this sentiment is even more pronounced when it comes to VTubers. </p>



<p>However—</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [I assure you it will be fine. If Kei-sama is the other party, there shouldn’t be any strange issues, and I have absolutely no concerns on my side.]</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Mariel-sama insisted on meeting even after my refusal.</p>



<p>Why would she go to such lengths? Isn’t it a bit too much just because she’s my fan? Besides, having such complete trust in me is somewhat unsettling.</p>



<p>I attempted to decline again, but Mariel-sama remained persistent.</p>



<p>The bizarre situation continued: Mariel-sama pushing to meet, and me adamantly refusing.</p>



<p>Why is she so persistent about this meeting? This strange dynamic, where Mariel-sama was insistent on meeting, and I continued to decline, continued for some time.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [<em>Mouu</em>! Just do as I say, Ketaro!]</p>



<p>Eventually, a message arrived, seemingly fed up with the ongoing back-and-forth. Although it didn’t quite match Mariel-sama’s character, that was not the point.</p>



<p>In the last message, the way she called me triggered a sudden image that appeared in my head.</p>



<p>—<em>Mouu</em>! Just do as I say, Ketaro!</p>



<p>Despite the strength of her words, I envisioned a girl glaring at me with teary eyes, clinging to me.</p>



<p>At that moment, I couldn’t help but suddenly understand. Why did a popular figure like Mariel-sama suddenly contact me? And why did she propose such an impromptu collaboration? Everything just clicked.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [I apologize for my words. I may have gotten a bit carried away. Leaving that aside, I genuinely want to meet and talk with Kei-sama <em>desu</em>. I won’t cause you any trouble, so could you please consider meeting me?]</p>



<p>While contemplating these thoughts, another message arrived from Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>Although her tone returned to normal, the desperation to meet me hadn’t changed. </p>



<p>I replied with an OK this time. If it were a while ago, I might have hesitated with questions like “Why are you going to such lengths?” or concerns about the distance between a fan and their oshi. However, those thoughts were gone now. Instead, there was a strong desire to meet.</p>



<p><strong>Chat (Mariel)</strong>: [Really? Thank you! Let’s meet tomorrow at—]</p>



<p>In response to my message, Mariel-sama, looking delighted, promptly provided details for our meeting, as if she had planned it that way from the beginning.</p>



<p>As I gazed blankly at the text, I realized I was immersed in a nostalgic feeling.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image4303_b90905-8e size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/WYSM_v1_9.jpeg?w=890&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“<em>Of course, it’s natural to be excited! Actually, I’ve been a fan of Kei-sama for a long time desu wa</em>“</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>On the next day in the afternoon on my day off…</p>



<p>I came to the rooftop of a complex commercial facility a few stations away from the nearest station.</p>



<p>This place was named “Sky Park”. Despite being on the rooftop of a building, it was lush with greenery, streams, and ponds. It was quite extensive, much larger than your typical park. While it’s not a place I usually frequent, it seems to be a popular dating spot.</p>



<p>The designated meeting place was supposed to be on one of the benches on the east side of the pond.</p>



<p>Looking around, there was no one nearby.</p>



<p>It seemed that she hadn’t arrived yet, so I decided to sit on that bench and wait for her.</p>



<p>From now on, I will be meeting Mariel-sama, the immensely popular VTuber, in real life.</p>



<p>It was an event that I couldn’t have imagined happening until recently, but strangely, my heart is surprisingly calm.</p>



<p>Casually, I gaze at the pond in front of me.</p>



<p>The view with the sky closer than from the ground is incredibly beautiful, and I can understand why this is a popular spot for dates. Well, not that this is a date or anything.</p>



<p>While pondering such things, I could hear footsteps not long after.</p>



<p>The sound of heels kicking the cobblestone echoes, making me lift my face and turn around.</p>



<p>However, the moment I see her, I involuntarily stand up from the bench.</p>



<p>“…D-Did I keep you waiting?” (?)</p>



<p>While saying this, she slightly averts their gaze, and I’m left speechless.</p>



<p>Twin-tailed hair shining golden in the sunlight with eyes clearer and greener than the sky.</p>



<p>A finely sculpted face like that of a delicate doll, with cheeks slightly tinged in red.</p>



<p>Despite not seeing her for several years, there’s no way I could mistake it.</p>



<p>“Serika…right?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It was the grown-up figure of Saionji Serika—my childhood friend who I had not seen in a few years.</p>



<p>“L-Long time no see, Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>I feel a strong sense of nostalgia in the slightly clumsy way she calls me ‘Ketaro’.</p>



<p>…Ah, yes, it’s definitely Serika.</p>



<p>“…Yeah, it’s been a really long time. Shall I make a guess as to why you’re here?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, yeah but you can probably already figure it out.” (Serika)</p>



<p>As she says that, the faint remnants of “Could it be her?” are transforming into “I knew it was her.”</p>



<p>“So, you really are, like, Mariel-sama, right…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Since I’ve shown up here, the answer is pretty obvious, right? That’s right, I’m the VTuber, Daitenin Mariel! Are you surprised, Ketaro?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Crossing her arms, Serika declares this somewhat proudly.</p>



<p>But, in reality, I wasn’t that surprised. I had half-convinced that it was her ever since yesterday when I heard the way she addressed me. The only person to call me by that nickname was my childhood friend, Serika.</p>



<p>“W-What’s with that lack of reaction? Aren’t you surprised at all?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Watching me in silence, Serika, with a slightly embarrassed and blushing face, approaches with a sulky expression.</p>



<p>But without answering her question, I open my mouth.</p>



<p>“Hey, Serika, can I make a request?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“A request? W-What’s this all of a sudden?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Can I hear Mariel-sama’s voice right here, right now?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What’s with that? Still not fully convinced? …Well, I guess there’s no helping it.” (Serika)</p>



<p>At my request, Serika shows a slightly exasperated expression and clears her throat.</p>



<p>“I am Daitenin Mariel <em>desu wa</em>. Do you believe me now, Ketaro?” (Serika)</p>



<p>And what came out was that cute yet mature voice that has comforted me many times before.</p>



<p>The moment I heard it, I unconsciously shouted.</p>



<p>“Woooooahhhh! Mariel-sama! Mariel-sama is right here with me!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Hey, wait a minute, Ketaro!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I-I heard Mariel-sama’s live voice for the first time! This is bad, my ears are too happy! A-And she called me ‘Ketaro’! Isn’t this like a service worth hundreds of thousands?! What should I do, should I be paying!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What are you even talking about!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>My excitement goes off the charts involuntarily upon hearing Mariel-sama’s live voice.</p>



<p>But it can’t be helped. My oshi who I’ve been supporting for so long is right in front of me! Even if the person behind Mariel-sama is my childhood friend, Mariel-sama is still Mariel-sama!</p>



<p>“Why are you suddenly getting so excited!? You were strangely calm during our reunion!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Of course! The VTuber I’ve liked and supported for so long is right in front of me! How can a fan like me not get excited!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I-I’m glad you feel that way… but, um, I want you to see me more as your childhood friend, you know…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Ah, I’m really meeting Mariel-sama now…! Oh, sorry, can you say that line from earlier one more time? I’ll record it for infinite replays later.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Wait, are you seriously taking out your phone!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry, maybe that was a bit much. How about a signature instead?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“The level of your requests hasn’t gone down at all! And why do you have a pen and paper ready like it’s normal!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, it’s only natural when I’m meeting Mariel-sama, right!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I retort confidently to the surprised Serika.</p>



<p>Well, I know I’m being rude to her. Even I’m surprised that I’m making such impolite requests to Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>Normally, you wouldn’t do something like this in front of your oshi. For example, if it were with Yuki, it would be impossible. But because the person in front of me was my childhood friend Serika, the sense of distance became distorted, making me act this way.</p>



<p>“Ah <em>mouu</em>! Since you already believe me, let’s drop the Mariel talk already! We’ve finally reunited after so long, there should be other things to talk about!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Other things? …Ah, right. I haven’t properly explained what I like about Mariel-sama.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“That’s not what I mean! I-It’s not like I’m not interested, but…! Right now, it’s not the time for that. L-Look, we’re both older now, hasn’t someone become more beautiful or something!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika says that while blushing, but I just tilt my head in confusion.</p>



<p>…Saying you’ve become more beautiful is stating the obvious. I mean, you were already known to be an extremely beautiful girl to those around you. The natural beauty she has inherited from her British mother has grown alongside her even until now.</p>



<p>“And, you know, there are other things to notice, right? Like maybe clothes and, um, it’s not like I put in extra effort into it or anything… And this too…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika moves awkwardly, showcasing her clothes and hair.</p>



<p>Her fashion sense is quite expensive but her sense of style is great as always—it hasn’t changed since the old days. She keeps particularly emphasizing her head or rather her hair, but those golden twintails are just like when we were kids. It’s got that signature Serika style.</p>



<p>“By the way, about that ribbon.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“!! Y-Yeah! D-Do you remember this ribbon!? I’ve cherished it ever since you gave it to me, and—” (Serika)</p>



<p>“The pattern on that ribbon! If you look closely, it’s the same as Mariel-sama’s hair accessory, isn’t it!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I say that, Serika, who was leaning forward, for some reason, almost tumbled forward, but I didn’t have time to pay attention to that.</p>



<p>…I had a feeling I’d seen that pattern somewhere before, so it was this!</p>



<p>“Are there other things like that!? Oh, could it be that your clothes are also related to Mariel-sama!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“No, they’re not! I put a lot of effort into preparing this outfit for today…! Ah <em>mouu</em>! We finally reunite after several years, and all you’ve been talking about is Mariel!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Why not!? I came here because I was summoned by Mariel-sama!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Serika suddenly gets angry. Certainly, I feel bad for being rude due to the distorted sense of distance caused by the fact that she’s both my oshi VTuber and my childhood friend, but what she’s saying is just too confusing.</p>



<p>“<em>*mumble mumble*</em> W-Well, that’s true! …But, I want you to see more of me, or, I came today with that intention…! <em>*mumble mumble*</em>“</p>



<p>“I have no idea what you’re mumbling about, but telling me not to talk about Mariel-sama is absurd. Do you know how much I like Mariel-sama?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Even after saying that, Serika still glares at me with dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>It seems she doesn’t believe that I’m a true Mariel-sama fan, but this might be the perfect opportunity. I’ll let Serika know about the significance of Mariel-sama in my life, considering how much she means to me.</p>



<p>I clear my throat and begin to express my love for Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>How charming Mariel-sama is, how she heals me every day.</p>



<p>I express my feelings as a Mariel-sama fan to Serika, who is right in front of me. Surprisingly, even though I’m speaking directly to her, I feel no unusual nervousness. It’s proof that, despite being the voice behind Mariel-sama, Serika and Mariel-sama are distinct entities.</p>



<p>……</p>



<p>“Uh… ugh…” (Serika)</p>



<p>At first, Serika listened to my words with her arms crossed, looking displeased. Gradually, her face turned red, and eventually…</p>



<p>“A-Alright, alright, I get it! I understand that you love Mariel! <em>Mouu</em>, I guess it can’t be helped!” (Serika)</p>



<p>While saying that, she pouted and turned away, but for some reason, her lips were quivering.</p>



<p>Anyways, it seems like my love for Mariel-sama has been properly conveyed… heh.</p>



<p>“Hmph, well, whatever. Since Mariel is me, if you think Mariel is cute, then that means I am too, right? It’s honestly a bit complicated with that extra layer… well, for now, I’ll let it slide.” (Serika)</p>



<p>No, that’s not what I meant. I’m clearly distinguishing between Mariel-sama and Serika… I was about to say, but before I could, Serika turned back to me and started talking.</p>



<p>“But, not today. Today, talking about Mariel is off-limits! We didn’t meet for that reason, you know?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What’s that supposed to mean…? Then, why did we meet?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh!? W-Well, that’s…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>It should have been a natural question, but for some reason, Serika seemed flustered.</p>



<p>After fidgeting with her hands for a while, she took a mysterious deep breath.</p>



<p>“Umm, can we talk while walking for a bit?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Saying that, she started walking around the pond, and I had no choice but to go along with it.</p>



<p>With a leisurely pace, we walked side by side, as if enjoying the scenery.</p>



<p>I was waiting for Serika to say something, but for some reason, she continued walking with her head down, not uttering a word. As the silence became a bit uncomfortable, I reluctantly spoke up.</p>



<p>“…Come to think of it, did you know I’m Kei?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh? W-What?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I mean, you called out to Kei, the YouTuber. Even though it was me standing here, you didn’t seem surprised.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, well, yeah. I knew Kei was Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Really? How?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Uh, well! I-I just happened to notice it was Ketaro by the voice and the way you talk in your videos!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Is that so? Then, what about the thing about being my fan?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, that’s not a lie either. At first, I didn’t know that I was a fan of your channel. When I found out about it later, I was surprised, but the fact that I’m a fan of Kei didn’t change.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika turned away with a pout.</p>



<p>…So, that kind of thing happens, huh? The world might be unexpectedly small.</p>



<p>“I see. But, didn’t you feel disappointed or anything when you found out that your oshi was your childhood friend?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, not really? That’s a different matter. And what about you? When you found out I was Mariel, were you disappointed…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“No, not at all. I was surprised, but my feelings of supporting Mariel-sama haven’t changed.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I make sure to state it clearly. As Serika said, it’s a different matter.</p>



<p>“R-Right! …I’m glad.” (Serika)</p>



<p>At my words, Serika smiled happily. Somehow, her steps seemed a bit lighter.</p>



<p>“But it’s still an incredible coincidence, isn’t it? Both of us being a fan of each other without knowing it.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah! It’s not just a coincidence; at this point, it feels like ‘fate’, doesn’t it!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Fate, huh? But, as you know, I’ve always liked games since I was a kid. So being a gaming content creator probably isn’t that surprising, but the fact that you became a VTuber, I could never have imagined that from the old you.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>That’s why until we actually met, I was thinking “Could it be her?” instead of “I knew it was her.” immediately.</p>



<p>“Well, various things happened in the four years we didn’t meet.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s been about four years now.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, to be precise, four years, thirty-three days, and around two hours and forty minutes.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Isn’t that too detailed!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>When I retorted, Serika stopped and turned her back towards me.</p>



<p>“… Four years, huh? Time has really flown by.” (Serika)</p>



<p>She muttered that softly while gazing at the pond.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ketaro, don’t you think this place is lovely? The sky is close, there’s greenery, it’s spacious, quiet, and a bit romantic.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? Oh, now that you mention it, it is.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“And it’s famous as a dating spot. W-Well, that’s not really relevant, but I wanted to come here at least once. So, I thought it would be nice to make it the place for our reunion.” (Serika)</p>



<p>When she suddenly said that, I was a bit taken aback. Serika turned around and looked at me.</p>



<p>“…Hey, Ketaro, how was it seeing me after four years?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What do you mean?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“S-So, like, did you think I’ve become more girly than before…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>When suddenly faced with such a question, I turned to face her. It was then that I noticed, for the first time, Serika looking at me with upturned eyes. Back in elementary school, we were about the same height, and now I realize there was a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>W-What’s gotten into Serika all of a sudden?</p>



<p>I was perplexed. It might have been just a casual remark, but once that awareness was planted, I found myself carefully examining Serika’s appearance.</p>



<p>Without the childhood friend filter, what stood before me was undeniably a beautiful girl.</p>



<p>Back when we were little, I didn’t really notice it since we were together all the time, but Serika was already renowned for being incredibly cute. Coupled that with her family background, she was treated like a princess by everyone. </p>



<p>That atmosphere remains unchanged even now that we’ve grown up—or rather, it has become even more striking. Even as her childhood friend, I can’t help but be amazed by how much she grew as a girl. Expressions like “she’s become more ladylike” fall short of describing the transformation.</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Even though I kept telling myself she was my childhood friend, I found myself stammering out a lame response. Nevertheless, Serika seemed somewhat satisfied, smiling contentedly.</p>



<p>“…Hey, Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>As we continued talking, Serika suddenly adopted a quieter tone and gazed at me.</p>



<p>“Earlier, you asked why did I call you out today, right…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Yeah, um.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…S-So, I’ll tell you the reason…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>With determination in her eyes, Serika declares this, and for some reason, my heart starts pounding in response to an atmosphere I’ve never experienced before.</p>



<p>“S-So, the reason is…! I-I, um…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>With a bright red face, Serika struggles to articulate her words. Eventually, she locks eyes with me, takes a deep breath, and then opens her mouth.</p>



<p>“I-I, um, I… about you…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Aaaaahhhhhh!?” (?)</p>



<p>“Wha-!?” (Both)</p>



<p>At that moment, a sudden loud scream echoed, causing both me and Serika to turn simultaneously.</p>



<p>“It’s Kei-kun! Kei-kun, Kei-kun!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yuki… Yukina-san!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki was running towards us with a beaming smile. However, I was shocked by the suddenness of the situation rather than being overwhelmed by her cuteness. </p>



<p>Moreover, her overly delighted expression resembles that of a lost puppy finding its owner. Was it just my imagination?</p>



<p>“Uwah, meeting Kei-kun in a place like this!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yukina-san, why are you here…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, I was here for a modeling photo shoot, coincidentally at Sky Park.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As Yuki pointed in the direction she came from, I noticed staff and people with cameras quite a distance away. Wait, did she spot me from that far away?</p>



<p>“So, Kei-kun, what about you?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Well, I…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I glanced sideways.</p>



<p>Noticing my gaze, Yuki seemed to finally realize that Serika was there.</p>



<p>“Oh! W-Were you here with your friend? If that’s the case, I’m sorry for disturbing you…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>She quickly shifted to an apologetic expression and bowed her head.</p>



<p>“Oh, no need to apologize! This is my childhood friend—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I hurriedly turned to introduce Serika.</p>



<p>“…Serika?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, Serika, wearing a shocked expression, was staring intently at Yuki, who had just appeared.</p>



<p>“Y-Y-Yukina Nozomi?!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Ah, do you know me? Nice to meet you.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-Why are you here…!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? Like I said before, I’m here for a modeling job, and it just finished. Then I saw Kei-kun, and—” (Yukina) </p>



<p>Despite sounding like a regular conversation, there was an underlying tension in their exchange.</p>



<p>In contrast to Serika’s trembling and uneasy state, Yuki calmly responded with her natural charm.</p>



<p>“…………Why, uuu… why…” (Serika)</p>



<p>Eventually, Serika lowered her head with her shoulders shaking, and began muttering something inaudible.</p>



<p>Wondering what was going on, I leaned closer, but…</p>



<p>“Uwaaaaahhh!?!?” (Serika) </p>



<p>At that moment, Serika abruptly lifted her face and let out a scream.</p>



<p>“Why does this always happen to meeeeeeee!?” (Serika)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>“Ehh~ So Serika-san is Kei-kun’s childhood friend, huh?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Hmph, that’s right.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Currently, we are at a cafe inside Sky Park.</p>



<p>After Serika managed to regain her composure from the mysterious scream, we decided to have a chat while having tea.</p>



<p>Yuki, talking with a bright smile, and Serika, not bothering to hide her displeasure.</p>



<p>Despite having completely opposite expressions, the fact that they could still have a normal conversation made me deeply ponder the mysterious nature of girls.</p>



<p>“I want you to remember, we’re not just acquaintances, we’re childhood friends. We knew each other ever since we were kids, so this relationship is more than just fate.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, no matter how you look at it, I think that’s an exaggeration…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Each expression is overly dramatic, and being childhood friends isn’t that significant, right?</p>



<p id="no1">It’s strange how she’s been unusually moody since earlier. Come to think of it, Serika has always been <a href="#footnote">temperamental<sup>1</sup>.</a> Some things never change.</p>



<p>“Ah, but I understand what you mean by fate. When I found out that Kei-kun was my classmate, I thought, ‘Ah, this must be fate!'” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Huh? What do you mean by classmate?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Actually, Yukina-san and I go to the same school, and we’re even in the same class.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Whaaahaha…!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika was quite surprised, her words getting stuck with a shocked expression.</p>



<p>But I can understand that reaction. Hearing that the idol, Yukina Nozomi, is your classmate is bound to be surprising. If I were in Serika’s position, I would have been even more shocked.</p>



<p>“…Which is stronger, a childhood friend you haven’t seen for four years or a current classmate? Oh, the childhood friend has overwhelmingly more time spent together, but that’s in the past. Now, being in the same class and an idol on top of that…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“By the way, do you two often go out together on your days off?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Ignoring Serika, who seemed to be muttering something with a desperate look, Yuki turned towards me and threw that question my way.</p>



<p>“Oh, no, it’s not like that. In fact, I haven’t seen Serika since elementary school graduation, and today is the first time we’re seeing each other after four years.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Really!? A reunion after four years sounds nice!… But what led up to this?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Uh, well…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…It’s because I was summoned by the VTuber Mariel-sama. But I can’t say that. Revealing that Mariel-sama is Serika is an absolute no-go.</p>



<p>Hmm, how should I explain this…? As I struggled to think, Serika spoke up,</p>



<p>“I-It’s fate! As fate would have it, I, the childhood friend, happened to be Ketaro’s oshi VTuber. So, we decided to meet in real life!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Wait!? Serika, you can’t…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Suddenly, Serika started revealing everything, and I felt incredibly flustered.</p>



<p>“Uh, VTuber…?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Daitenin Mariel… Haven’t you heard of her? That’s me.” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Ah, she really just went and said it! I internally facepalmed, but Serika herself seemed oblivious. In fact, she looked rather proud, which is troublesome. Is saying that really okay!?</p>



<p>“Um, sorry. I’m not familiar with that kind of stuff. Is she a famous person?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Wha!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>But Yuki seemed to be completely unaware of the existence of VTubers, and she apologized with a sorry look, leaving Serika with a weird look on her face.</p>



<p>“Y-You don’t know…!? A super famous VTuber like me…!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Uh, sorry. I think I’ve heard of the term ‘VTubers’ somewhere, though.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Wait, you’re supporting Ketaro, so you use YouTube, right!? How can you not know about VTubers!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I only use YouTube to watch Kei-kun’s content.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Upon that straightforward answer, both Serika and I were left speechless. While I felt a bit special hearing that, Serika seemed visibly frustrated and growling with a “Grr…”</p>



<p>“…Ugh, to not know the legendary VTuber Daitenin Mariel, who reached millions of subscribers in less than a month…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…You know, it sounds cringy when you say it out yourself, especially since it’s coming out of Serika’s mouth instead of Mariel-sama’s.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Shut up! It’s a fact, so deal with it!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Mariel…? Ah wait, could it be…?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>As we were having this exchange, Yuki seemed to suddenly realize something.</p>



<p>“Were you the one who did a collaboration stream with Kei-kun yesterday? There was an animated-looking woman in the bottom right of the screen, and you both played LoF together.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Yes! That’s right! That was me!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“I did watch that! Kei-kun’s name was trending even though he wasn’t streaming, so I was curious and tuned in. I had no idea that I was watching a VTuber! There were a lot of viewers too!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Seeing Yuki excitedly recall the moment, Serika finally regained her composure and proudly puffed up her chest once again.</p>



<p>“Hehe, well, it was really exciting yesterday. To showcase such god-tier plays on our stream, as expected of Ketaro.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“That’s right! Ke-kun’s play yesterday was really incredible! I was so moved that I cried at that amazing comeback at the end!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“If you’re shown such plays, it’s inevitable to end up revealing that he’s your oshi, right? Even though it unintentionally went viral, considering Ketaro’s skills, it’s only natural, don’t you think?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“That’s right! I totally understand the feeling of wanting more people to know about Kei-kun! So, I unintentionally made Kei-kun go viral too!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“…Ugh! I’m well aware of that!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“We’re both in the ‘Let’s Make Kei-kun Go Viral’ club!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Yuki had a beaming smile, but for some reason, Serika wore a frustrated expression.</p>



<p>“Y-You know, I’ve been supporting Ketaro for a long time!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Oh, really? I discovered Ke-kun’s channel about six months ago. Serika-san, when did you start?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Hehe, from the very early days when Ketaro started doing game commentary.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Wow, that’s impressive! I wish I had found Kei-kun’s channel earlier!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Hehe, when it comes to being a Ketaro fan, I want you to recognize me as your senpai.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“But, despite that, you didn’t leave comments or anything, right? Except for the occasional passerby, I was the only one commenting on Kei-kun’s videos.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I was holding back, or rather, I wanted to endure until the right time—wait a minute! Have you been commenting all this time?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“That’s right, I always leave comments on all of his videos I watched, including livestreams.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“W-Wait a minute, could it be…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Do you recognize the name ‘wankoromochi’? That’s me!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“That was you!? So, while I was holding back, you were freely commenting and interacting with Ketaro…! Still, even if I didn’t comment, remember that I’m the senpai here!” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Serika’s words are incredibly confusing. Meanwhile, Yuki, smiling, responds with a cheerful “Yes”, looking like an angel. What does this exchange even mean…?</p>



<p>As I ponder, Yuki turns to me with a smile and starts talking.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kei-kun, Serika-san is such an interesting person, isn’t she? Aside from being talented, she’s very beautiful, a super popular VTuber, and also your childhood friend. She’s really amazing.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Being childhood friends with me isn’t something particularly amazing, but it’s a fact that Serika is incredible in many aspects. So, I wholeheartedly agree with Yuki’s words and nod.</p>



<p>“Especially since she’s the one behind Mariel-sama. Just being the person behind Mariel-sama makes her not just amazing but legendary. I’ve been supporting her since her debut, and above all, her voice is incredible. Plus, she’s good at commentary, and the way she interacts with her viewers is amazing. I can definitely say that she’s the strongest VTuber right now.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Wait a minute, Ketaro…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>What’s with her? Is she getting embarrassed by the praise? It’s the truth, so it’s fine, isn’t it?</p>



<p>“Why are you only praising Mariel? You should, like, talk more about how I’ve always been beautiful, how much you like my blonde hair, and how we’ve been together since childhood…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>She suddenly went off on a nonsensical rant?! Seriously, I have no idea what she’s talking about!</p>



<p>Isn’t it weird to praise your childhood friend that much!? And why is she randomly saying I have a thing for blondes!? Sure, her blond hair is incredibly beautiful, but still…!</p>



<p>“How much of an approval-seeking monster are you!? Besides, since you’re Mariel-sama, praising Mariel-sama is basically the same as praising you!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, yeah, but…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Wow, Kei-kun, you’re really passionate about supporting Mariel-sama. It’s nice to hear you talk so passionately about her…” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Well, I feel the same way about Yukina-san…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Even if you say that, being supported by Kei-kun out loud is really an honor…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>…Isn’t that supposed to be my line? You compliment me way too much.</p>



<p>“W-Well, that’s right! You can be more envious!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Now, Serika proudly responds to Yuki’s words. She sure is emotionally unstable. Despite her boastful tone, there’s a complex expression on her face, and I’ve never quite understood what she’s thinking.</p>



<p>“But it’s nice to talk about your oshi, right? I always wanted to have a passionate conversation with someone about Kei-kun but there was no one like that around me. So today, I’m really happy to have met Serika-san, who also supports Kei-kun.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Well… I agree with that. It’s nice to have someone to talk about Ketaro’s charm with.” (Serika)</p>



<p id="imagetext">“Serika-san thinks so too!? Then, um, if it’s okay, could you talk with me about Kei-kun!?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Hmph, if that’s what you want!” (Serika)</p>



<p>The topic of the conversation suddenly shifted to praising me.</p>



<p>The flow of conversation was swift, both of them were in high spirits. As for me, I could only sip my coffee and watch the lively exchange between the two. Bitter.</p>



<p>“What I like about Kei-kun is definitely his way of talking! It’s calm, easy to understand, and really entertaining! His voice is very gentle and nice. I feel like I can watch Kei-kun’s streams forever!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“That’s true, Ketaro has surprisingly good communication skills. Since he’s mostly a loner, not many people know, but I’ve been by his side for a long time, so I know! His way of talking is the same as before, but his voice has changed and now he sounds even cooler…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“And also, he’s really skilled at games! I mean, I can’t help but be captivated by his dazzling plays! Not only that but he also does live commentary and explanations while pulling off those plays.  Even for someone like me who’s not knowledgeable about games, I can understand that takes talent!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Ketaro has always been into games since back in the day. At that time, I wasn’t interested in games, but watching Ketaro play was enjoyable. He made sure to explain things in an easy-to-understand way so that I wouldn’t get bored. I’m sure those experiences back then are connected to the Ketaro we see today!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What’s amazing about Kei-kun is not just his gaming skills. His knowledge of anime, manga, and other things is impressive too. He weaves in those discussions between gameplay during his commentary, which keeps things interesting. Thanks to that, I’ve discovered a lot of great works! Everything Kei-kun recommended turned out to be interesting!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Ketaro is a hardcore otaku at heart. I used to get dragged into his otaku hobbies a lot. But he does have good taste, and all the works he said were interesting back then turned out to be hits later on. He might have foresight or something. But Ketaro isn’t a selfish otaku; he also properly indulged in my hobbies from time to time and played with me!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>… Kei-kun is truly the best streamer, isn’t he?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Yes, Ketaro is the best childhood friend, after all!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…Uh, what’s this strange feeling?</p>



<p>Yuki and Serika have been enthusiastically discussing their oshi since earlier. Both of them have genuinely happy smiles while talking, but… there’s this lingering sense of discomfort. They should be talking about me, but it feels like something is slightly off. Well, I can’t quite put my finger on it, but as long as they’re having fun, it’s fine.</p>



<p>Switching my focus, I absentmindedly sip my black coffee, having forgotten to add sugar or milk. It would be a bit awkward to use them this late into drinking it, so I leave it black. While doing so, I casually observe the two. However, my attention gradually shifts towards Serika.</p>



<p>…Serika has changed, hasn’t she? Not so much in appearance, but I feel like her personality has evolved.</p>



<p>She used to stand out in various ways, but now, I feel like she has softened up a bit…? Seeing her casually chatting with other girls like this is quite refreshing for someone who knows her from the past. And, it makes me a bit happy too.</p>



<p>Four years can bring about such changes, huh? She used to have no interest in games or otaku-related things, but now she’s a popular VTuber. Oh, how times have changed.</p>



<p>“Oh, speaking of which…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I pondered such thoughts, a sudden question crossed my mind, and I couldn’t help but voice it out.</p>



<p>“Serika, why did you decide to become a VTuber?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Right, there have been so many shocking revelations that I completely forgot to ask about that.</p>



<p>“Eh!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Upon hearing my question, Serika, who had been engrossed in conversation with Yuki, reacted as if caught off guard. She jerked her body, turned towards me with a somewhat flustered expression, and for some reason, kept glancing between Yuki and me.</p>



<p>“W-Why!? W-Well, that’s…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika stumbled over her words. Then, strangely, she looked at Yuki, turned back to me, and repeated this motion a few times.</p>



<p>“S-So… that’s because… um…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…That’s because?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“You…! You looked at me…! S-So, that’s why…! Ahh <em>mouu</em>! there’s no way I can say it now! Yes, that’s right! It’s part of my social studies! Social studies!” (Serika)</p>



<p>And for some reason, after venting like that, she suddenly turned away. …I have no idea what’s going on.</p>



<p>“Why are you getting mad… Well, I guess it’s typical of Serika to say something like ‘social studies’.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Why are you just accepting that so easily?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What else am I supposed to do!? You’re the one who said it!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“By the way, Serika-san’s character seemed very mature. How do you decide on a VTuber character design?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Oh, well, about that…” (Serika)</p>



<p>In response to Yuki’s question, Serika glanced briefly in my direction before continuing.</p>



<p>“In my case, I decided on the design myself, but there’s a reference I used…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“There is!? Please tell me!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Don’t just latch onto that part!… Well, whatever. I’ll tell you. Ketaro, do you remember? The game you used to be obsessed with.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Which one are you talking about when you say ‘the one I used to be obsessed with’?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“You know, the one with the fallen angel girl as the main character who flies in the sky and defeats enemies.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Oh, ‘Demonic Armament Princess’! That brings back memories.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah, that one! The protagonist with disproportionately large breasts.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Don’t emphasize that part too much; it makes it sound like I was into it for that!… But well, yeah, I was definitely hooked on that at the time.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“You like that kind of character, right? W-Well, it’s not like there’s a deeper meaning or anything, but I happened to recall that, and sort of used it as a reference…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“No, it’s not like I played it because I liked that character. I got hooked because the game itself was interesting. The character part is separate.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Upon hearing my words, for some reason, Serika showed a stunned expression.</p>



<p>“W-What!? So, you mean you don’t like that kind of character…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“It’s not that I like or dislike them… Well, it’s just normal, I guess?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“……………………” (Serika)</p>



<p>“W-Why does it seem like Serika-san is completely burned out?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>…Nonono, I don’t get why she’s so shocked about this.</p>



<p>“…By the way, Ketaro, what kind of girl characters do you like?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? Why are you asking something like that—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Just answer!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What’s with you!? Seriously… Uh, cute ones, I guess?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Maybe I should go change my character now.” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Serika seems to be strangely gloomy. But Mariel-sama’s character is already perfect as it is, so there’s no need to change the character.</p>



<p>“In any case, why is it so vague!? Come on, give me something more specific!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Why are you getting mad at me!? I don’t get it! Seriously, you haven’t changed at all in that aspect!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?! Isn’t Ketaro the same?!!” (Serika)</p>



<p>However, at that moment, a small chuckle reaches our ears, and we both turn around simultaneously.</p>



<p>“That’s amazing, you’re so in sync with each other. You two really are close childhood friends, huh?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>When Yuki said that with excitement, I shook my head reluctantly.</p>



<p>“Even though it’s been a few years since we last met, the fact that we are talking like this…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“No, it’s the other way around. The fact that you two can argue like this after not seeing each other for years means you two must be really close. Otherwise, It’s impossible. I envy that kind of relationship.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Is that so? I glance at Serika, and for some reason, her face is completely red.</p>



<p>“Besides, it’s nice to see Kei-kun arguing with his childhood friend…! It feels so natural, and I get to see a side of Kei-kun that I’ve never seen before! Ah, Kei-kun arguing with his childhood friend… so precious…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Um, well, you know, it’s kind of embarrassing when you say that right in front of me!?</p>



<p>“Since it’s Kei-kun, he must have always been protecting Serika-san like a knight…! ‘Come on, stay behind me.’ ‘Y-Yeah…’ Something like that! Ah, so sweet…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>But, you know, she’s just making assumptions. It wasn’t like that at all! If anything, I was the one often following behind Serika and getting dragged around by her!</p>



<p>“Serika-san, you’re so lucky to be childhood friends with Kei-kun…!” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“A-Alright, I get it!… Ugh, to say things so straightforwardly that I can’t even brag anymore…! A-Anyway, Ketaro!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Unable to bear the embarrassment, Serika pointed sharply at me and forcefully changed the topic.</p>



<p>“I’m going to create a messaging group and add you inside, so hurry up and take out your smartphone.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh, a messaging group? Why now?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“It’s for future communication between us. It’s more convenient than using DMs, isn’t it?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika says this as if it’s obvious, but… no, no, no.</p>



<p>“Isn’t that a bit risky? Exchanging messages with a very popular VTuber…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Why are you saying that now when you have already said VTuber in person? Besides, we’re childhood friends, aren’t we? What’s wrong with childhood friends wanting to stay in touch?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Certainly, it’s too late to worry about that, and since I’m messaging Serika instead of Mariel-sama, well, maybe it’s within an acceptable range… right?</p>



<p>“I feel like the line I set for myself to not cross is dropping steadily. Is this really going to be okay…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Why are you mumbling to yourself? Come on, I’ve already created the group, so join it.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Despite my serious internal struggle, I was brushed off, and I reluctantly opened the app to join the group.</p>



<p>“…That’s nice.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>However, at that moment, I noticed Yuki looking at us with a sad expression.</p>



<p>“Messaging with Kei-kun, that’s nice… Serika-san, I’m jealous…” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Ugh, please don’t look at me with those lonely eyes…! I can’t exchange messages with Yuki since that would definitely be crossing a line.</p>



<p>“………….” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Argh! When I see her puppy eyes, it feels like my heart is being pierced by guilt! </p>



<p>“………….” (Yuki)</p>



<p>“Uh, um, Yukina-san, would you like to join the group too…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Is it okay!?” (Yuki)</p>



<p>Upon hearing my words, Yuki’s face brightens up.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Serika’s face is suddenly struck by a thunderstorm.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ketaro! Do you think it’s acceptable for an idol to exchange messages like this!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Don’t talk as if you’re innocent! Well, I know it’s not okay… But there are circumstances, you see.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh? Shall we hear about these circumstances?” (Serika)</p>



<p>…Concerning the fact that my childhood friend is radiating a dark aura and is incredibly scary.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image4319_2ef053-21 size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/WYSM_v1_10.jpeg?w=1045&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p><em>“Serika-san thinks so too!? Then, um, if it’s okay, could you talk with me about Kei-kun!?”</em></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>“W-Well, you see, it’s about Yukina-san’s comment.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“My comments?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s something I was planning to tell you when we meet. You always comment on my streams and videos under the name ‘wankoromochi’, right? I was thinking that from now on, it might be better to refrain from doing that for a bit—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh…!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>At that moment, Yukina’s face turns pale.</p>



<p>…I feel like I could hear a <em>*gaaan*</em> sound effect, she seems to be in shock to that extent.</p>



<p>“T-That’s…! Commenting on Kei-kun’s channel is my reason for living…! Is Kei-kun is telling me to die!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“That’s not it! There are actual circumstances at hand!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I quickly explained to both of them about the post I found speculating that ‘wankoromochi’ might be Yukina, and the possibility of her being exposed.</p>



<p>“If it’s revealed that idol Yukki is in the comment section…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“There’s no doubt it would cause a ruckus online. Ketaro’s comment section would become chaotic as people try to dig up all the previous comments left by her.” (Serika)</p>



<p>Upon hearing Serika’s words, Yuki slumps down with a heavy expression.</p>



<p>“T-that’s no good… I don’t want to cause trouble for Kei-kun… But, if I can’t comment anymore, then I…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s not like I’m telling you to completely stop commenting. I’m just saying it would be better to reduce the quantity a bit.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“But there are so many things I want to talk about in Kei-kun’s streams and videos!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Which is why I thought that if Yukina-san could join our messaging group, you could share your thoughts directly over there.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Eh?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“The issue is with writing in the comments section, but it’s totally fine if you share your thoughts directly in the group. …Um, is that okay?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I say that, Yuki is silent for a while, but eventually…</p>



<p>“N-No problem! It’s not a problem at all! I’m actually happy…! Hehe~!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Soon, she genuinely seemed delighted, savoring the joy with her whole being.</p>



<p>With a joyful expression, Yuki takes out her smartphone and directs a beaming smile towards Serika.</p>



<p>“Since both Serika-san and I are Kei-kun’s fans, let’s make this a Kei-kun fan group! I look forward to working with you!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>She energetically bows her head. Perhaps her innocent demeanor was too much, as Serika seemed somewhat deflated, showing a slightly complex expression while shrugging her shoulders.</p>



<p>“…Honestly, talking to a popular idol through messaging… what are you even thinking?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“That’s rich coming from you… Besides, if it’s okay with you, a childhood friend, then it’s okay with Yukina-san too, since she’s a classmate.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p id="no1">“That’s called <a href="#footnote">sophistry<sup>1</sup></a>.” (Serika)</p>



<p>You’re the one who started it first…, as we exchange such banter, Yuki suddenly interjects in the conversation.</p>



<p>“Oh, right! Um, Kei-kun, I have a little favor to ask. Is that okay…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Happily gazing at her smartphone, Yuki suddenly seemed to recall something. Now, with a slightly embarrassed expression, she brought up something like a request.</p>



<p>“Um, Kei-kun, you call Serika-san by her first name, right?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Well, I’ve been calling her that for a long time.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“S-So, you know? Since I’m also a Kei-kun fan like Serika-san, I was hoping you could call me a bit more casually…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“C-Casually?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“S-So, you know, like using my name, or something…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…Name? Like Nozomi…?</p>



<p>While imagining it, I became extremely flustered.</p>



<p>…Calling Yuki by her name like that would be too presumptuous!</p>



<p>“S-so, um, Kei-kun, you’re my fan, right? What do you call me in your head?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-well, normally, I call you ‘Yuki’ in my head.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“T-That’s it! From now on, I want you to call me ‘Yuki’…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…Oh no. The way she said it with a slightly embarrassed look is too cute, it’s painful…!</p>



<p>Certainly, in my heart, I’ve always been calling her ‘Yuki,’ and since it’s her idol name, it’s not strange at all… but…</p>



<p>“U-um… Yuki?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh!? K-Kei-kun, calling me Yuki…! <em>Hauuu</em>…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki seems to be reaching her limit, and I feel like I’m about to reach my limit too!</p>



<p>I’m not doing anything weird, so why do I feel this strange sense of taboo…!</p>



<p>“Why are you smirking like that…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Being glared at again by Serika who was now shrouded in a dark aura, I somehow managed to keep my composure. While alternating between glancing at me, who involuntarily straightened my spine, and Yuki, who is still at her limit, Serika lets out a small sigh with a displeased expression.</p>



<p>“…How did this happen…? In the first place, having her here is completely unexpected. …<em>Haa</em>, why does it always end up like this…” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika mutters such things in a small voice. I couldn’t quite catch the latter part, but if it’s about being unexpected, I feel the same way.</p>



<p>“Honestly, I never expected to reunite with Serika this way.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…What? So, you still have an issue with me being Mariel.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“No, it’s not like that.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Facing Serika’s piercing gaze, I shake my head and continue.</p>



<p>“I had always thought that maybe I wouldn’t get a chance to see you again, so it was unexpected.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean by that…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, you’re quite a high-class young lady, right? You’re living in a completely different world… Although you went to the same public kindergarten and elementary school for moral education, I heard you started attending a prestigious girls’ school starting from junior high. So, not only did we get separated due to my move, but I thought you were far away in that sense as well.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“T-That’s…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“But I never imagined that you would become a VTuber, and we’d get to reunite this way. It’s like… um, yeah, it made me incredibly happy.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Upon my words, Serika opens her eyes wide in surprise.</p>



<p>“You are happy…? Y-You are happy that we reunited…?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Well, yeah. We’ve been childhood friends since kindergarten. Well, for you, I might have been more like a servant than a childhood friend.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-What are you talking about?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Because you always threw difficult tasks at me. And most of the time, you had an unhappy expression. Weren’t you aware of that?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“S-so, that’s because you…! Uuuuu…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>For some reason, Serika starts to growl with a bright red face.</p>



<p>“Well, anyways, I was happy to reunite with my childhood friend. Even though Serika being Mariel-sama and being my fan is nice, the fact that we could meet again as childhood friends made me the most happy.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…I-I‘m also…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Hm?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…I’m also happy to be able to reunite with you…” (Serika)</p>



<p>While muttering softly and avoiding eye contact, Serika says so. </p>



<p>She’s always been someone who couldn’t be straightforward because of her personality, and that hasn’t changed at all. But strangely, I find that aspect of her, which hasn’t changed, genuinely heartwarming.</p>



<p>“I see. That’s good, then.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>So, I replied with a genuine smile. It was a smile that genuinely came from my heart.</p>



<p>“Ahh <em>mouu</em>…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika, without making eye contact with me, blushes and looks down.</p>



<p>After staying silent for a while, she mumbled something in a really quiet voice.</p>



<p>“…If that’s the case, I should have gone to meet you sooner…” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Huh? What was that just now?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…! N-nothing! Anyway! I’m not only your childhood friend but also the VTuber Daitenin Mariel, and your fan! From now on, I’ll keep supporting you, so be prepared for that!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“What do you mean, ‘be prepared’!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, me too, me too! Now that I’ve joined the group, I’ll support Kei-kun even more than ever before!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-Wait, I’m the one talking right now, don’t interrupt me!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Ah, of course, Serika-san, let’s support Kei-kun together!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Are you even listening to what I’m saying!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Despite the seemingly chaotic exchange of words, it seems like they’re having a normal conversation. It’s impressive how they manage to communicate.</p>



<p>While observing Serika like that, I can’t help but laugh at how she hasn’t changed since the old days.</p>



<p>…Supporting me, huh? Well, that’s my line.</p>



<p>When I first found out that Serika was the one behind Mariel-sama, I was confused, but now I feel even more motivated to support her precisely because she’s Serika.</p>



<p>I silently vow in my heart to continue supporting Mariel-sama as always.</p>



<p>At the same time, having connected with both Yuki and Mariel-sama through messages, I remind myself that I need to maintain a sense of moderation more than ever before.</p>



<p>☆</p>



<p>[Serika’s PoV]</p>



<p>“Yes, I met him. Of course, I told him that I was Mariel… Don’t worry, he’s my childhood friend, he’s not the type to spread it on social media.” (Serika)</p>



<p>That night, I reported the day’s events to my manager during our voice chat.</p>



<p>“…Yeah, so rest assured. We’ll continue collaborations from now on. …I know, it was sudden, I apologize for that… Yes, yes, I’ll be more careful.” (Serika)</p>



<p>I apologize sincerely for the sudden collaboration yesterday and for going to meet Ketaro today. These were decisions I made on the spur of the moment, so I wanted to make sure I apologized for any inconvenience caused.</p>



<p>“Oh, and by the way, I also met ‘Yuki’ today. …Yes, that idol, Yukina Nozomi. …Why? I want to know that too. She suddenly appeared at our meeting spot… Yes, it’s related to Kei, and it turns out they were classmates. Oh, right, I also told Yuki that I’m Mariel… So it’s okay. I made sure to make it clear, and since she’s a professional, I’m sure she’ll handle it properly.” (Serika)</p>



<p>I think of Yukina Nozomi’s face. When I researched her, she gave off a cool impression of an idol but thinking back to that affectionate expression she showed to Ketaro, my chest feels uneasy. …And, as expected, being an idol, she was incredibly cute…</p>



<p>“…S-So, there’s no problem at all. It won’t affect our future activities… Huh? What? Be careful not to break character…? I’m not breaking character at all! Even Mariel acts like that when talking with their oshi! …Anyways, collaborations with Kei and such will continue, so be prepared for that. …Yes, yes, then see you.” (Serika)</p>



<p>After finishing the conversation, I sigh and take a moment to relax.</p>



<p>…She’s such a worrier. Well, I guess it’s only natural as a manager.</p>



<p>But what’s this about breaking character? It’s okay for Mariel to get excited once in a while, right? Besides, [Daitenin Mariel] is a character created for Ketaro, so it’s only natural for her to be like that.</p>



<p>I switch my mindset, stand up from my chair, and dive straight into the bed.</p>



<p id="imagetext">Hugging the pillow tightly, I reflect on today’s events.</p>



<p>“…Ketaro, you looked so cool…” (Serika)</p>



<p>As I unintentionally mutter those words, my cheeks flush with warmth.</p>



<p>Thinking of the figure of the childhood friend I met after such a long time already makes my heart flutter. He was always cool, but his grown-up appearance was unexpectedly more manly, and I couldn’t help but feel shy and avoid direct eye contact for a while.</p>



<p>“Ketaro, we finally met…” (Serika)</p>



<p>Immersed in the joy of the reunion, my thoughts drift back to our early childhood.</p>



<p>I first met Ketaro before entering kindergarten. Our fathers were friends, so we got to know each other through their relationship. At that time, our homes were close to each other, so we always played together. This connection continued until just before we entered middle school and had to part ways.</p>



<p>We might seem like very close childhood friends, and that’s true. Our relationship has always been good. However, that alone wasn’t the only reason we stayed together. Strictly speaking, it’s more accurate to say that Ketaro has always been by my side.</p>



<p>Not to brag, but I’m an outstanding person. I’m smart, good-looking, and come from a well-off family. If I have to point out a flaw, it might be the size of my chest, but… well, that’s not really important! Anyways, I was recognized as a ‘person who had everything’.</p>



<p>However, being the type of person typical of such characteristics, I also had a high pride and a somewhat reserved personality, which often led to conflicts with other kids around me. Naturally, I would end up isolated from my surroundings, but Ketaro, my childhood friend, was always there by my side, never leaving me despite my troublesome nature.</p>



<p>I can’t exactly remember when I first started liking Ketaro. The expression “realized I liked him before I knew it” is probably accurate. By the time I reached the later years of elementary school, I was aware of my feelings.</p>



<p>But being the reserved person I was, I couldn’t bring myself to express those feelings openly. While I was hesitating, Ketaro moved away when we entered junior high school.</p>



<p>It was lonely to be separated, but surprisingly, I didn’t feel too down about it. In fact, I saw it as a good opportunity. Although I couldn’t be straightforward, I, being the outstanding person that I am, decided in my heart that during this period of separation, I would fill the gap within me and, when we reunited, I would become Ketaro’s perfect girlfriend.</p>



<p>And so, during my junior high school days, I earnestly polished myself up. I worked hard on my studies, physical activities, and even made an effort to improve my social skills. Not only that, but I also dived into hobbies like singing and dancing. I even hired a coach to learn about otaku culture and practiced playing the games Ketaro loved.  In short, I ventured into every field I deemed necessary to become Ketaro’s girlfriend and mastered them all.</p>



<p>Becoming a VTuber was actually part of the plan to polish myself up. </p>



<p>Upon receiving reliable information that Ketaro was into VTubers, I immediately took action to become one. I auditioned and got accepted into [Twinkle Live], a major VTuber agency. I crafted my character’s appearance and speech, keeping Ketaro’s preferences in mind. Furthermore, in my performances, I imagined myself interacting with Ketaro. All of this was driven by my sole desire for Ketaro to fall in love with me.</p>



<p>The effort paid off, and I gained popularity as a VTuber, with Ketaro even becoming one of my fans. While that was great, my initial plan was to reunite with Ketaro and become his girlfriend around the same time as we started high school. However, before I knew it, the plan got delayed by a year.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the plan was still successful. The idea was to surprise Ketaro by revealing that I, as Daitenin Mariel, was the VTuber he had been supporting all along. We would reunite dramatically, and then the two of us would finally become a couple.</p>



<p>“…that was the plan…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Just before that, an unexpected incident occurred, causing my carefully crafted plan to crumble—Yukina Nozomi.</p>



<p>In an unexpected turn of events, the current top idol suddenly started endorsing Ketaro and it went viral. I couldn’t believe it—someone had seemingly stolen my plan right from under me!</p>



<p>The day I learned that Ketaro and Yukina Nozomi had suddenly gone viral, I was frozen in shock. I immediately canceled the scheduled livestream and ended up falling asleep.</p>



<p>“Why is this happening…?” I cursed fate while writhing on the bed, but I realized that I couldn’t linger in this shock forever. Determined to bounce back, I convinced myself that I had no choice but to do something myself. Although Yukina Nozomi beat me to it, I would follow through with my plan to make Ketaro a hit. Then, we would reunite, and I would confess my feelings in a surprise revelation.</p>



<p>Though my plan to make Ketaro go viral and surprise him was stolen by Yukina Nozomi, the subsequent developments were irrelevant. I had envisioned following through with the plan, reuniting with Ketaro, and finally becoming his girlfriend, but…</p>



<p>“Why did she have to show up there again? What are the chances of such a coincidence!?” (Serika)</p>



<p>I angrily pounded my pillow. It still infuriates me when I recall it. During the emotional reunion and climax of the confession scene, Yukina Nozomi once again interfered. It was too much even if it was just a coincidence. God, did I do something wrong!?</p>



<p>As a result, I couldn’t confess. Despite the long-awaited reunion, Yukina Nozomi intruded, and she turned out to be Ketaro’s classmate? This was outrageous! Not only that but she was an incredibly beautiful girl, and she genuinely supported Ketaro a lot!</p>



<p>“Ah <em>mouu mouu mouu</em>!!” (Serika)</p>



<p>I roll around on the bed, recalling those frustrating moments. Why does Yukina Nozomi have to ruin things for me repeatedly? Why is she always by Ketaro’s side? It’s just too unfair.</p>



<p>“But…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Eventually, I stop rolling and gather myself.</p>



<p>But I will never give up. When I remember Ketaro’s smiling face during our reunion, an unwavering determination wells up from the depths of my heart.</p>



<p>I won’t lose. No matter if the opponent is a top idol, I will absolutely not let go of Ketaro.</p>



<p>Because I was the first one to fall in love with Ketaro.</p>



<p>Because I was the first one to be Ketaro’s fan.</p>



<p>“Be prepared…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Uttering words that I’m not even sure are directed at Ketaro or Yukina Nozomi, I hold the pillow tightly, determined to first figure out whether Yukina Nozomi is truly going to be a rival in love or not!</p>
