<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter Ⅱ: Just Once, I Wish to See You</h1>

<p class="calibre5">I’m soaked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The rain started pouring halfway through my walk, leaving me as wet as if I’d jumped into a pool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I should’ve just taken the bus home with Himari and the others…</p>

<p class="calibre5">But then again, I’m not really fond of Enomoto-san. It’s not that she’s a bad person. It’s just that she’s a bit intimidating, or maybe she’s too beautiful and I find it off-putting…</p>
<p class="calibre5">When was the last time I spoke to a girl other than Himari? Sure, I’ve talked to girls in committees, but never just casual conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While lost in thought, I finally reached home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a two-story house, and across the small street is a convenience store my parents run.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I parked my bike beside the house, unlocked the door, and went in. As I was heading toward the bathroom, my third sister, Sakura Natsume, showed her face from the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Out of my three sisters, she’s the only one who is a third-year postgraduate without a suitor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing me wet from head to toe, Sakura visibly grimaced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">‘Who’s going to clean this hallway?’, She’s probably thinking,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, can’t you wait until you get a towel?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t expect you to be here, Sakunee-san. What about the convenience store?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We have a part-timer in right now. I’ll wipe this up for you, so go take a bath quickly.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thank you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I entered the changing room, I found a fluffy white ball of fur in the laundry basket.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Daifuku, could you move?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon hearing my voice, the ball of fur stirred.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Triangular ears perked up, and the white cat glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then it yawned and curled back up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This guy…</p>

<p class="calibre5">With no other option, I threw my wet clothes directly into the washing machine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The bathtub was already filled with hot water. Nice, Sakunee-san. I quickly rinsed myself off and soaked in the warm tub.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Heaven…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wonder if I should use Sakunee-san’s bath salts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I’ll definitely get scolded later.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Huh? Daifuku is meowing happily in the changing room. That literal ‘pleased-purr’ sound means Sakunee-san must have come in.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll leave your change of clothes here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You look awfully too tired, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was fixing an old accessory…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, from Himari-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, another girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…what?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why is it so quiet… Whoa! Don’t just swing the bathroom door open like that!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t tell me you’re thinking of cheating! If you make Himari-chan cry, you’re not getting off easy!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not! In the first place, I’ve said that Himari is just a friend!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No ‘just a friend’ would go out of her way to help you sell flower accessories like she does!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s the truth, so what can I do?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s really mad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari is just too likeable, and her charm isn’t just for show.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s the perfect girl to introduce to the family. Even my sisters are completely smitten with her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s just a girl who knows Himari… Her accessory broke, so I was fixing it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can’t you just do normal things like go to karaoke or bowling?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mind your own business… Can you please close the door?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s cold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So much for warming up in the bath.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. So, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine to close the door, but why are you coming in?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I thought I’d wash Daifuku while I’m at it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The white furball, held against Sakunee-san’s chest, jumped in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, his tail was grabbed and he was pitifully plunged into a washbasin filled with hot water. A sorrowful meow echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I don’t know, since you’re not going to listen, couldn’t you just wait to wash Daifuku until after I’ve finished my bath?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, I’m just really mentally drained. Oh, Sakunee-san, that’s the shampoo for Dad and me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t nitpick every little thing. Besides, aren’t you mentally too weak? How can you even think of owning your own store? “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s so accurate, I can’t say anything…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Absolutely, she’s right. I’m speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, if it’s just running the register or customer service at the front of the store, I can hire part-time workers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I think it’s naive to expect consistent sales from accessories, which are fickle products.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, listening to opinions and requests about the products is my job. That’s not something I can entrust to someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I have to go out in public, too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My face is reflected in the bathroom mirror. I still look as grim as ever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I try to smile like Himari…no, this won’t do. No one would think someone like me would make cute flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be great if Himari could handle customer interactions with a smile, like she did today, but that can’t go on forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right now, Himari is accompanying me because she doesn’t have anything else to do.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By that time in the future, she’ll probably be married or something.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But it was a good experience, I guess?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sakunee-san said, her face oddly serene, and Daifuku had turned into a sorry mess; the contrast almost made me laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’ve been only making accessories for Himari-chan all this time, right? It’s no wonder your style has become one-sided.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean ‘one-sided’? I’ve been making various types of accessories to ensure variety…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Huh? I feel a piercing stare. And then, she lets out a sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I didn’t say this before to be considerate, but the stuff you’ve been making recently all looks pretty similar.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The words struck me like a dagger to the heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s absurd. Sakunee-san seems to check Himari’s Instagram too, but to make such an assertion…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean? I make earrings, bracelets, and even stationery items like sticky notes and bookmarks…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not about the purpose, it’s about the image. There’s no change in the situation or atmosphere, it’s all the same. Like a ‘stagnant miniature garden’… Were you not aware of this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But wait, now that I think about it, it does feel that way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course it does. My work is promoted through Himari’s Instagram.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I aim to create things that fit perfectly with Himari… is that what she’s pointing at?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t say anything because I thought you’d give up on having your own store halfway through. But since Himari is also involved, I thought it was time to speak clearly.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sakunee-san picked up a bath towel and started wiping down Daifuku.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The little white ball of fur had lost all will to resist and just lay there listlessly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t you think you need a wider range of emotions? Like items that reveal passionate love or deep despair from a heartbreak?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But the sales are going well…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? Has it been consistently increasing? Haven’t you noticed a recent plateau in growth? What’s the rate of repeat customers? Aren’t people just buying once and then feeling satisfied?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How do you know all this!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What you’re doing with Himari’s Instagram is merely adding the value of Himari as a model. If such a naturally country idol girl like her wears your accessories, of course everyone will want them. But the reality is, people who buy might think, ‘This doesn’t look right on me.’ It’s only going to suit girls who are equally attractive.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sakunee-san is sharp.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She might be unemployed now, but back in high school, she was hailed as a ‘once-in-a-decade prodigy.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">What she says is mostly sound, and that’s why it stings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her current words are no exception. Even though I haven’t told her, it’s as accurate if she’s seen the sales data.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My flower accessories have few repeat customers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Accessories are a one-time affair. They’re not like a lifelong marital partner; they’re more like a lover that makes a moment shine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A single encounter shouldn’t linger; moving on to the next one is probably a smarter choice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tried to convince myself that’s how it should be, but in reality, maybe that’s just an excuse for not taking action.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You remember our agreement, right? If you don’t have your own store by the time you’re 30, you’ll quietly take over our family’s convenience store. You gave up on becoming a civil servant like our parents wanted, so the least you can do is fulfill this responsibility.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I know. Until then, you’ll keep an eye on the store for me, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And while you’re at it, go ahead and make Himari your wife. I plan to take my retirement fund from you, so I’d like someone cute and considerate to take care of me in my old age.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I have no idea what you mean by that, Sakunee-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Don’t try to entrust your life to someone else’s daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not that I’m in a position to say this, but my Sakunee-san is a bit disappointing at times.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">The next day after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was about to head home, Himari quickly grabbed her bag and followed me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu! Not working on anything today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m a bit tired, so I’m going home. What about you? Hanging out with someone else today?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari glanced back at the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Some classmates who had invited her to hang out before are probably still around.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, I think I’ll go home with Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, okay. But I want to get home early today…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Give me a ride on the back, okay?♡”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…okay, I’ll walk.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the bike rack, I went to get my bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As we left the school gates, Himari promptly placed her bag in the basket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She stood on the rear axle of my bicycle, placing both hands on my shoulders.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Come on, Yuu, let’s go home!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Himari, can’t you just walk like a normal person?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ehh, no way. I don’t want to walk.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Standing upright on a bike, doesn’t that tire you out?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How about I sit on the saddle, and you wrap your arms around me from behind…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Fine, let’s keep it as it is. Just stay still so you don’t fall off.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What are you trying to make me do? That is way too embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I pushed the bike and walked home, then Himari hummed a tune and lightly patted my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, you seem to be in a great mood.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe, finally, I can see eye-to-eye with you, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sleepy, so don’t shake me too much. I’ll seriously fall over.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Usually, I wouldn’t mind, but today I’d rather get home quickly without Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, Yuu, you were yawning a lot today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was really sleepy…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Staying up late? We didn’t even play online games together yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was reading a manga.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? That’s rare for you. You usually only read what I recommend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was thinking of narrowing down my next accessory based on themes. It was for a reference.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? Like what?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… ‘Passionate love’ and ‘deep despair from heartbreak.'”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As expected, Himari burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She began to slap my shoulder from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pffahaha! What? Yuu, are you interested in love now?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s really jumping on this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, if the roles were reversed, I’d react the same way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Actually, Sakunee-san said…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Long story short.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I explained yesterday’s conversation with Sakunee-san, she nodded in agreement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. Well, there’s some truth to that. There are times when I wish your accessories had a bit more… er*ticism.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“E-Er*ticism…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Like an explosion of emotion or a good kind of roughness? I don’t mean low-quality. But being too polished can make it look like it’s an ‘honor student’ vibe, I guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously, you feel that way too?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha, Sakura-san isn’t saying it to be mean. Maybe she thinks it’s time for you to take the next step?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I wonder if that’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like she enjoys teasing me. That’s probably why she gets along with Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean by ‘the next step’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, how do I put it? Instead of only focusing on what you want to create, maybe start looking at what customers want? You’ve been making what you think is good, but that’s what Sakura-san refers to as stagnation. If you want to succeed in business, you need the customer’s perspective. Lack of repeat customers is often the reason why sales are low.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see..so that’s how it is.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know how our family owns property? Several times a year, people sign leases, wanting to try something new. But most of them fail and close up shop quickly. Just recently, a new croissant shop opened, but the location was poor.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Location?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, it was on the route to a middle school. They were aiming for after-school hours and had freshly baked bread ready, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I get it. You can’t sustain a shop targeting middle school allowances.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly. That area has a lot of nursing homes and hospitals, but the demand for fancy bread is low. There’s also a major convenience store chain across the street.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That hits close to home.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Our own convenience store is doing fairly well now, but the situation might have been different if we had such competition nearby.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Little considerations like that are necessary when you’re making accessories, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re really good at persuading me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha. That’s because you’re genuinely passionate about your flower accessories. Normally, people would get defensive when they hear things like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…probably, there are a lot of things going on in the Inuzuka family.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really rely on Himari’s mature insight. She’s not just handling publicity on Instagram, but she’s also a big help behind the scenes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what do you think about narrowing down the theme to ‘romance,’ from Himari’s perspective?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seems reasonable? Your flower accessories mainly target women, and girls love romance.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She peeks at my face over my shoulder from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Whoa, don’t move too much. You’re going to throw off the bike’s balance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what were you reading?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was reading ‘The Quintessential Quintuplets.’ It’s said to be the top-selling romance manga right now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a rom-com though, not romance.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t even know the difference.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, when you say ‘romance,’ it usually involves more complicated relationships… Well, that’s open to interpretation. So, who’s your favorite character?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The answer to this question came to me instantly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yusuke Takeda.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Who the heck is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know, the classmate who has a test showdown with Futaro for the tutoring position…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a guy, isn’t it!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because he’s really devoted. Even though Futaro barely acknowledges him, he’s always been trying to surpass him in grades. He’s so admirable…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, that’s one way to look at it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Moreover, he doesn’t have any grudge. That’s proven by how cheerful he is when he leaves. I want to become best friends with him…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari pounces up and down on my back from behind, frustrated.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey! I’m right here! Yuu’s best friend is right here!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I get it, I get it! We’re just talking about fiction!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So stop moving around on the bike! Seriously, it’s dangerous!</p>
<p class="calibre5">She acts like it’s no big deal, but Himari is actually quite possessive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…This is probably why her relationships don’t last long.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So no heroine names came up, huh? I guess you didn’t gain much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I did come up with some design ideas…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hand over the notebook I pulled out of my bag to Himari behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While looking at the design sketches I hastily scribbled during class, Himari candidly says,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“They’re not bad, but they’re not great either. I know all five heroines, but none of these accessories really feel like they’d belong to any specific one of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly, that’s the issue. These are just accessories that might suit the five heroines, but they don’t express their individual passions or despair.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is this like Muzan-sama’s popcorn? (無惨様のポップコーン)”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Who’s Muzan-sama?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The final boss in ‘Demon Slayer.’ Ah, you don’t have to read it now; it’s not related to romance. But it’s interesting, so I’ll lend it to you later. My brother has the complete series.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? Thanks.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What I’ve learned is that even if you draw motifs from romance manga characters, it’s meaningless if you can’t empathize with their feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just like making accessories that would suit Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For me to truly relate, I need personal experience.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what is love, anyway?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow. You’ve gone into complicated territory.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You knew I was complicated from the start.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yeah, that’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hey, don’t affirm it with a smile on your face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And also, stop poking my cheek and saying, “I’m the only one who puts up with complicated Yuu. Be grateful. Shower me with gifts.” stop flaunting that too. I’ll settle for a shake from the McDonald’s just off the 10th highway.</p>
<p class="calibre5">… I’m completely losing here, emotionally.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You said you don’t really understand romantic feelings either, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey-hey, Yuu-kun. Even if I don’t understand feelings, you know I’m super popular, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What are you bragging about when you can’t even keep a relationship for a week?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Heh. Love is over the moment you confess. That means I’m the strongest.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, so as the ultimate expert on love, Himari, what is love to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t it like wanting to kiss or, you know, wanting to do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s just lust…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I already knew this, but my best friend is so vulgar it’s shocking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari raises her index finger and continues with a triumphant look.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s not true. Because you wouldn’t want to kiss someone unless you like them, right? So the moment you want to kiss someone, you’re already in love with them, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, hold on. Don’t suddenly get complicated, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And could you also stop whispering ‘kiss, kiss’ in my ear? It’s starting to make me a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari explained with a broad grin. She really comes alive when she takes the lead in our conversations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So wanting to kiss and being in love happen simultaneously. When you, Yuu, want to kiss a specific girl, that’s love.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So love is just a s*xual desire?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Or maybe s*xual desire itself is like an antenna for romantic feelings? What are your preferences, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, you’re really going to ask me that? I don’t want to say.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you prefer bigger bre*sts?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re really pushing. Why? …uh, yeah, I guess bigger?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Black hair? Or maybe you like a tinge of red? Ah, assuming it’s long.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why are we talking about hair color? And why are the options so specific?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, Enocchi has reddish hair.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why? I’m startled by the sudden mention of Enomoto-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t you want to kiss Enocchi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why? Where is this sudden push for Enomoto-san coming from?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I just thought it might be easier to imagine with a model in mind. I’m not trying to explore how well you and Enocchi would match or anything~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Isn’t casually bringing up the name of one of your friends more evil than anything?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hey, could you stop making that ‘Ah, this is why you’re a virgin’ face?</p>
<p class="calibre5">You’ve just dated more people, but your experience is pretty much the same.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I give up. At least I’ve never looked at a real girl and thought I wanted to kiss her.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm, same here. I’ve never thought I wanted to do it myself, either.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Both a guy and a girl are having a thoroughly unsexy conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that can’t be helped. If we were the kind of people who fall for the opposite sex just like anyone else, we wouldn’t be such carefree best friends, would we?</p>
<p class="calibre5">To think our relationship has such a flaw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Want to give it a try?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I think Himari just said something strange.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I turned to look at her involuntarily. Her marine blue eyes are staring straight at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A trial kiss. With me.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“A trial kiss. With me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whaat!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stop in my tracks, and Himari headbutts me in the jaw in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I almost fall over with her, but somehow manage to stay upright. I’m so proud of myself//.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oww…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, don’t just stop all of a sudden…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We both crouch down on the spot, enduring a dull pain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With teary eyes, I meet Himari’s gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know, we can’t do that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because that means you have romantic feelings if you think you want to kiss, right? Have you been looking at me that way?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, not at all. You’re just my best friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">????</p>
<p class="calibre5">??????????</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’ve never thought about wanting to kiss a girl, right, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s true, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But we don’t even know what the feeling of ‘wanting to kiss’ is like in the first place, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess so…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, if we try it out as a test, there’s a chance we might think, ‘Oh, maybe I know what that is?’ If we figure that out, we’re set, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see what you mean…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makes sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now that she mentions it, I do feel that way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For Himari to come up with a good idea that I’d never think of… Wait, I’m an idiot for being convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No offense, but that logic sounds incredibly stupid to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“There’s no way it’s okay to kiss a best friend like that. What, is that what we do now, like Italians with their customary greetings?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari grinned. Uh-wow, she’s up to something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She suddenly grabbed my hand, and intertwined our fingers, lover-style.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because she keeps pulling my hand, I have to balance my bike with one arm. To anyone looking, we’d seem awfully lovey-dovey.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thankfully, there’s no one around, thanks to the back road.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s going on, though? I can’t read Himari’s thoughts, and it’s kind of scary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But if there’s no emotion involved, what’s the difference between doing this and kissing? It’s just skin-to-skin contact, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Could you stop making it sound like I’m some loser who’s desperate to hold hands with girls?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ehh, I’m happy to hold hands with you, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Turns out you’re the loser…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry. I only do this with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not what I’m worried about…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari lightly flicked her lips with her thumb.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A light gloss that wouldn’t get noticed by the teacher. It was on Himari’s finger, and it seemed to shine a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Should we try kissing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ugh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait-wait. Calm down, me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just the usual joke. Anyway, she’s bound to burst out laughing soon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our relationship isn’t so shallow that I’d be swayed by something like this…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, it is the first time she’s said something ‘Should we try kissing?’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Either way, it’s a bad joke… hey, why are her cheeks slightly blushing?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes seem moist, too… No, no, don’t pull on my tie.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We’re super close right now. Close enough for eyelashes to touch… whoa, Himari’s breath just brushed past my nose.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Stop it, my heart. Don’t beat so fast. This is no longer something we can laugh off!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s brother will kill me. Or I’ll be forcibly made into a legitimate little brother-in-law… but, looking at her again, isn’t she just too beautiful?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I reflexively closed my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no reaction at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I timidly opened my eyes, there was Himari, desperately trying to hold back her laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pffhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s slapping the bicycle saddle and laughing hysterically. Her hair is all messed up, too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seriously, where did that cool and beautiful girl go?</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_07.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">That means…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I’ve been played with.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I sit huddled in the corner of the back alley, Himari comes up and pats me on the back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, sorry. But you have to admit that it’s funny.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I was expecting it to be a joke, but… that still hurts, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if I’ve never thought about kissing a girl, I am, after all, a pure-hearted high school boy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari is still laughing heartily without a shred of remorse.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, if you’d call it charm, that’s just what makes her ‘her’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Doing something like that with Yuu right now would be a bad idea.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? What do you mean, ‘right now’?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She grins broadly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There it is. A smile that says, ‘Aren’t I just the cutest little devil for tricking you with that pretend kiss?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yeah, you’re cute, but don’t ever do that again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, maybe I should apologize to Yuu for what just happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, really, it’s fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, why don’t you trust me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s more like I trust you too much. I mean, this is the first time you’ve ever offered an apology. That’s suspicious.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Come on. There’s a first time for everything. I promise you won’t regret it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s lines are too cool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No choice then. Once she gets like this, she won’t back down until I agree.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good thing she wasn’t born a guy. If she were, she’d probably have been stabbed by now by some ‘Victims of Himari’ group.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So what’s this apology?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Himari grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing that, I realized, ‘Ah, it’s probably nothing good,’ but my intuition was half-right and half-wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">The next day was Saturday. No school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had finished my morning shift at home and was heading to the Aeon Mall in the city.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…By the way, I was in a sleek, black car. The surface was shiny, and the seats were plush.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, it looked more comfortable than my own bed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the driver’s seat of this luxurious car sat a handsome young man with jet-black hair slicked back and wearing sunglasses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Dressed in a simple yet expensive-looking polo shirt and equally high-end jeans. He had a solid build despite his slim figure, probably because he was a rugby player in college.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Inuzuka Hibari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s second-oldest Onii-san. A weirdo who calls me his ‘brother-in-law.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">He suddenly parked his car in front of a convenience store after my shift ended and took me with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s cheerfully humming a tune. It’s that song from when Kana Nishino appeared on the Red and White Song Festival last year.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu-kun. How have you been?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hello, Hibari-san. It’s been a while…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, you haven’t shown up at our place recently. I’ve been missing my Yuu-kun’s dose, so I had to come and see you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to join in on a family birthday party…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You went to Sushiro with Himari recently, didn’t you? Your brother-in-law is feeling lonely!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s because, Hibari-san, you always order high-end sushi. I’m not used to expensive sushi and honestly can’t appreciate the taste. I feel bad about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha! It’s that honesty of yours that I like!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is bad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s kind of scary how he interprets everything I say in a positive light.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, I totally missed the chance to react to his casual declaration of being his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, Hibari-san, why did you bring me along today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? Didn’t Himari tell you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She only mentioned we were going out but didn’t say when. My parents freaked out when a foreign car suddenly parked in the convenience store lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for that. To make it up to you, I’ll send over delivery from a sushi place I frequent tonight.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Please don’t. My parents are pretty simple people. If you do that, they’ll might actually consider sending me into the Inuzuka family to be a son-in-law.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? That sounds great. Should I start doing it daily?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Could you please consider your sister a bit more!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This Onii-san seriously seems to think of her as nothing more than something for making me his brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What exactly does he find so appealing about me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Finally, we arrived at the Aeon in the town center. It’s too familiar for the locals to feel anything special about. More familiar than the faces of our own parents, even.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hibari-san parked the car in front of the main entrance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, my job ends here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh. Aren’t you coming with us today, Hibari-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hibari-san’s eyes sparkle as he removes his sunglasses, quite unlike Himari’s.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have to prepare some materials to knock down the old guys at the upper levels of my workplace. I’d really love to go anime merchandise hunting with you, but such are the woes of being a corporate slave.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Leaving behind a refreshingly dangerous remark, Hibari-san walked away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Did Hibari-san really come just to see my face?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The way I can’t tell if he’s joking or serious is frighteningly similar to Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…So where’s Himari?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Might as well send a message on LINE.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I’m messing around with my phone in front of the glass-paned entrance, I feel a light tap on my shoulder from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around, I saw Himari, the very person I was looking for.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s emitting a scary aura from her back, all while smiling sweetly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like she’s saying, ‘Hehe, even in casual clothes I look adorable, but you? You look like you just got off a convenience store shift. Are you underestimating me? I’ll kill you!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sure, the oversized off-shoulder spring knit and cargo pants fit the neutral beauty that is Himari perfectly, but it’s not like I had time to change because your Onii-san hurried me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, as I always say, style starts with your own outfit!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If that’s the case, could you have given me a little more time? Hibari-san suddenly took me away, and I haven’t even had lunch.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Geez. With that attitude, you’ll be hated by cute girls, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I know you’re cute, but it’s not like we care about that stuff at this point.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, she even knows the pattern on my underwear. Ah, no, not in a weird sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She rummaged through my dresser when she came over to my house to hang out once.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seriously, she’s the one who brought up a ‘trial kiss’ yesterday, so it’s no wonder things got weird.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This is exactly why you’re not popular with the girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, what’s the matter with you? You’re particularly prickly today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We have a special guest today. It’s not just us, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t told about this. I had assumed it was going to be a usual shopping trip for accessories with Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari chuckled and gave a thumbs-up in a certain direction. I looked that way and was taken aback.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you serious…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then I spotted a mature-looking, black-haired beautiful girl, and it turned out to be Enomoto-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Noticing my gaze, she started walking toward me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hello.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“H-hello.”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_08.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">We exchanged awkward greetings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that she came over means this isn’t just a coincidence meeting, right? Of course, it isn’t. How did our holiday plans align so perfectly?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I pulled Himari aside, quickly checking on the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Err, what’s going on? Why is Enomoto-san here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, she’s here because we’re shopping with Enocchi today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I wasn’t told about this!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s because I didn’t tell you!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My best friend is the worst…</p>
<p class="calibre5">She probably guessed that if she told me beforehand, I’d get nervous and not show up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The accuracy of her prediction is the downside of our long relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, Enomoto-san is glaring at me…Or is she just looking at me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s hard to tell with her; she always seems somewhat in a bad mood.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh, Enomoto-san. Where’s Makishima today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Shi-kun is at club activities.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. Must be tough.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“..It doesn’t have anything to do with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right. I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Something’s off. She was more open the day before yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is she like a video game NPC whose dialogue resets overnight?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari steps in, looking back and forth between us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Aren’t you both a bit too stiff?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Look, it’s awkward being pulled together without any prior information. It’s fine for Himari since you knew.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, but Enocchi knew about it. In fact, the whole idea for today’s outing came from Enocchi.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Himari’s mouth was covered from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san dragged her into the shadows while holding both her hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“H-Hi-chan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, okay! Just don’t pull on my clothes!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then they seemed to be holding a whispered strategy meeting. This is too suspicious. I feel like going home right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two of them came back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari cleared her throat and started speaking in a theatrical manner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, have you thought about our next Instagram shoot?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The next one?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course, she’s talking about the flower accessory promotional Instagram account run by Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Come to think of it, it’s almost been a week since our last post.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s about time to start planning the next move.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Actually, I haven’t thought about it at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, that’s not good. We should be more enthusiastic about our business.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But we’ve pretty much exhausted all the winter-blooming flowers for accessories, right? Now we’re just waiting for the spring-blooming flowers to open…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s precisely why it’s a chance to try something new. Once things get busy, we won’t have the luxury to do so. Besides, we can always get flowers from a flower shop.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s a fair point. I should delve into the ‘romantic’ accessories that Saki Nee-san suggested and apply them to our next shipment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But what’s this ‘new thing’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How about a ‘special edition’ of our usual Instagram shoots?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Special edition?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari clapped her hands and pointed dramatically at Enomoto-san with both arms.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Guess what! Just for this time, Enocchi will be the temporary model for accessory creator 『you』!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was genuinely surprised. This is skipping a lot of steps.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san will? Why? And did you talk about me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, well, I’d say it’s more like Enocchi figured it out?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You’re kidding me…</p>
<p class="calibre5">When our eyes met, Enomoto-san nodded with a subtle expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It is strange to keep so many accessory parts on hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I guess so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m left speechless. I only hang out with Himari, so I’ve completely lost touch with common sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, it’s fine. It’s not like I’m hiding it anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I open a store someday, I’ll have to be the one standing at the counter anyway.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But why would Enomoto-san model?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We were discussing how to thank you for the repair you did last time. So, we thought, why not have you make accessories for someone other than me for a change? Yuu, you’re very lucky to get to flirt with such a beautiful girl under the pretext of making accessories.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Don’t nudge me so gleefully, I don’t know how to react.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is too sudden, then Himari sought Enomoto-san’s agreement.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi? That’s right, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san nodded affirmatively.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I don’t really understand, but she doesn’t seem to be reluctant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, the whole thing is jumping ahead and doesn’t make sense, but if she’s okay with it, then it’s fine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So the point is, changing the model might add some excitement?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly. Oh, by the way, we’ve already secured a location for the photo shoot. Enocchi’s family’s pastry shop is letting us use their space.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really!? Will it not be a bother?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve already gotten permission from Enocchi’s mom. She said it should be fine since there’ll be fewer customers two weeks from now, during Golden Week.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari looked at Enomoto-san again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!? L-Let me call my mom and check!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She hastily pulled out her smartphone… ah, she dropped it!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, are you okay!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m fine. I do this often, so I have a screen protector on it…Geez, Hi-chan, don’t spring this on me all of a sudden.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Muttering resentfully, she starts the call again on her smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, Himari. You actually didn’t get permission, did you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, Enocchi’s mom loves these kinds of events, so she won’t say no.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s not the issue here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looks really troubled… ah, while talking to her mom on the phone, she made a small ‘OK’ sign with her right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seems like it’s okay.But even if their families are on good terms, this is too forceful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himari, aren’t you being more pushy than usual?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, Enocchi is a bit reserved. If we keep asking for her consent, we’ll never get anywhere.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, that’s a secret for you, Yuu♡”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her perfect smile silences any objections.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like she’s planning something strange. I want to grab a taxi with my own money and head home…</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">In this rural shopping mall, there’s no such fancy thing as a movie theater.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s there are food sections, restaurants, and clothing stores that completely occupy the second floor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, a special events area sells ridiculously expensive health equipment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In one corner on the second floor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Next to the elevator, there’s an accessory shop we always go to. They mainly offer women’s items and have a wide variety of accessory parts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There, we were treating Enomoto-san like a dress-up doll and having fun.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, how about this red garnet stone?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nice. Red really suits Enomoto-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If it’s warm colors, I think this orange one would also look good.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that makes sense…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While talking with Himari, Enomoto-san, who’s all dressed up, spoke with a somewhat ambiguous expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun, you seem more lively than usual…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah!? Oh, sorry. Was I, um, being weird?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not that you’re weird. It’s just, how do I put it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, you’re definitely thinking it. I’ve even put you off just by saying that, haven’t I?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sensing the atmosphere between us, Himari jumped in with a cheerful tone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, Yuu is really creepy, isn’t he?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey! That was the moment for you to say, ‘Not at all.'”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? No, because you are creepy. Sorry, but you’re really creepy. I always think it, but the moment you step into an accessory shop and strike that weird triumphant pose, it’s super creepy.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can you stop criticizing me with a straight face!? And you shouldn’t say such things even if you think them!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It can’t be helped. It just pumps me up, okay?</p>
<p class="calibre5">While we were doing our comedic routine, Enomoto-san, who was caught in the middle, started to shake her shoulders.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pfft. Ahahaha… ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Noticing our gaze, she hurriedly turned her face away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari said, smugly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi also has a low threshold for laughter, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Himari, don’t actually say that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">See, her face has gone all red. This girl is really weak to being teased.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know how she manages to be an old friend of Himari’s.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, Natsume-kun, Hi-chan… What is this?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san, having regained her composure, asked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She seems to be questioning why she’s being turned into a dress-up doll.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, we hadn’t properly discussed it with her either. Being suddenly taken to an accessory shop and having various stones placed on you would be confusing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you’ll model for us, we were thinking of figuring out what type of accessories would suit Enomoto-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san seemed convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although she was convinced, it didn’t look like her feelings of embarrassment had disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Especially since the store clerk has been bringing us new accessories with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Guess it’s different when you have quality material to work with. I get it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, Yuu, grab that necklace over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t you get it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m messing with Enocchi’s hair right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s that? A hair clip?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was thinking, since Enocchi has beautiful skin, how about doing an updo?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, makes sense.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s good. Specifically speaking, the nape of a woman’s neck is quite a focal point. For a beautiful girl like Enomoto-san, that alone could win her first place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I have short hair right now, so this could be a fresh look for me too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“True that…Enomoto-san, would you like to give it a try since we’re here?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With her permission, I boldly decided to proceed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I picked up a sample necklace from the display case to hand over to Enomoto-san, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Himari, don’t block Enomoto-san’s hands.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But Enocchi has long hair, and I can’t hold all of it on my side.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I make eye contact with Enomoto-san, who looks a bit troubled. Her hands are filled with an array of new accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari peeks her face over Enomoto-san’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t you just put it on her, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… No, Enomoto-san would probably be uncomfortable with that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not like it would feel good to have a guy you barely know put accesories on you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, Himari grins and whispers something to Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi is okay with it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Um…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She briefly makes eye contact with me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She nods hesitantly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m fine with it, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You don’t have to worry about Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not worrying, really. I’m actually okay with it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is that so…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san seems like the popular type; maybe she’s used to guys?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t really have that impression of her. Or maybe she doesn’t even see me as a guy to be conscious of.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I’m the only one hesitating here, I’ll get called out for being ‘Oh no, Natsume-kun is so self-conscious. So creepy!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">That would also be annoying, so let’s just get this over with quickly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, just stay still.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“O-okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari has already occupied the space behind Enomoto-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With no other choice, I reach around her neck from the front. I take the clasp of the necklace to the back of her neck.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A sweet scent wafted up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is she wearing perfume? Himari doesn’t wear anything like that, so this is quite new.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As Himari said, her skin was beautiful, and her hair was well-maintained and silky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her sister is a model, so it makes sense that Enomoto-san would also pay attention to her appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Getting approval from such a beautiful girl to be a model is something that may or may not happen again. I was taken aback by the sudden developments earlier, but I have to thank Himari too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While thinking about that, I was about to fasten the clasp of the necklace.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At that moment, I caught sight of Himari’s eyes narrowing over Enomoto-san’s shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Crap. She’s thinking of something weird again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu. There’s something I’ve been thinking about all day.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She leaned in and whispered in a sickeningly sweet voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi’s casual clothes are pretty sexy, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Both Enomoto-san and I flinched simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Reflexively, my eyes dropped. Her outfit today consisted of a leather jacket, a shimmering shirt that gave off a slender vibe, and a short skirt that almost revealed her thighs.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had never really noticed before since she usually wore her uniform so loosely, but looking again, her style is amazing. She really looks like a model.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Also, the neckline is dangerous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The collar of her shirt was wide, looking vert bold. It almost felt like something out of a gravure shoot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…When I happened to lift my eyes, I met the gaze of a teary-eyed and trembling Enomoto-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I quickly looked away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“H-Himari!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha! It’s just a joke. Yuu, if you react that blatantly, you’ll reveal that you’re a virgin.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up! Don’t say unnecessary things… Also, apologize to Enomoto-san!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that, Enomoto-san moved behind Himari and firmly grabbed her neck.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With her face redder than ever, she let out a voice full of resentment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“H-Hi-channn…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Come on, Enocchi. Calm down… Ow ow ow ow. Enocchi, stop choking me. That’s how you hold a cat when you want it to shut up. I’m not a cat, you know.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is divine punishment, plain and simple.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The fact that she considers this on par with a cat’s mischief is sinful in itself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…But, you know, seeing Enomoto-san puffing up her cheeks while looking so mature was, embarrassingly, I thought it was kind of cute.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Look, Enocchi. As an apology, Yuu will treat us to lunch.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hold on. This is clearly your fault.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Yuu are the ones who benefited, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re doing a lot of damage to my reputation. If you hadn’t done something weird…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I want curry. Let’s go to the Indian restaurant on the first floor, the usual place.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you even listening?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While we were acting like this, a store clerk glared at us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, we’re causing a disturbance to other customers. We’ll withdraw for today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After purchasing the prototype accessories parts, we left the accessory shop.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">After a late lunch, we stopped by a flower shop on the first floor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We had bought the parts for the prototype accessory, so next, we came to get some flower samples. We’ll test these at school and decide on the new pieces for the photoshoot by Golden Week.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Though small, this shop has a great selection. It’s well-maintained, and the air is always filled with a fresh fragrance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The front of the store displays bouquets of vibrant preserved flowers. They make perfect gifts or souvenirs. During Halloween and Christmas, they are sold in containers shaped like pumpkins and Santas.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Upon entering, the store was filled with the pleasant scent of flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The first thing that caught my eye was a large showcase that covered an entire wall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the glass case were delicate fresh flowers that would quickly wilt at room temperature.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A small stream of water flowed through a groove at the bottom, serving as a refreshing background music.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shelves as tall as us were lined up along the aisle of the store. On them were potted flower arrangements prepared by the staff.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Toward the front were pots with colorful flowers, while further back were simpler-colored pots containing lilies and the like.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…The space is quite narrow, so I always have to sidestep as I walk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And on the wall at the back of the store, there was an array of hanging flowers. Flowers like wisteria and trailing morning glories that spread their vines layer upon layer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looked up in awe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was like a colorful tsunami made of fresh flowers. Other flower shops don’t display flowers in such abundance, but this display was breathtaking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was overwhelmed the first time I saw it too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san spoke, visibly excited.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“N-Natsume-kun! I had no idea they had something like this!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m glad you like it. The density of the display here is amazing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, yeah. It’s similar to that time!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That time?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I asked her to clarify, Enomoto-san seemed startled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she said, “N-no, it’s nothing…” and quickly moved away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What happened? Did I do something weird?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, whatever.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was a bit hurt, but first things first, I need to choose the prototype flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was wandering around the store, Himari soon approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In her hand was a small pot of cactus. It was probably a gift for her grandfather, who likes bonsai and such.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, have you decided what to buy?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. Well, we agreed earlier that warm colors would be good, so I’m thinking of going with that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I gazed at the showcase of fresh flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Pointing to a corner of it, Himari said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How about dianthus or marigolds?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’re already growing those at school. If we’re going to buy and make something, it might be better to go with something we’re not already growing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, how about roses?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, they’re the quintessential flower of love, but I’m not really feeling it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know how they say every rose has its thorns? As for Enomoto-san, well…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seems like she realized what I was getting at.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“True, it’s the opposite with Enocchi.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She looks like she’d have thorns, but she’s actually incredibly straightforward.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You get it, right? Enocchi is cute, isn’t she?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I do think she’s cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So what? That’s what I feel.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san may be cute, but she doesn’t have any ongoing relevance to me. She only agreed to be a model this time as a thank-you for fixing her accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Himari sighed,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, you’re so dry. You’re not the type I’d expect to make such a beautiful flower accessory.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh. Sorry about that. I’m fine as long as I have Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Are you finally thinking about marrying into the Inuzuka family?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a leap in logic..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m just talking about how every day is fun…I will absolutely not become a brother-in-law!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, from the other side, Enomoto-san came closer while looking at the flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari quickly grabbed her hand and pulled her over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Enocchi, which one do you think is good?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What!? H-Hi-chan…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Girls squealing among the flowers make quite a good picture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, the quality of the cast is high. Honestly, this scene alone could probably top Instagram.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi, say which one you like. The flower is for you, after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, well, I’m not really knowledgeable about this…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay, it’s okay. This is something you pick more with your feelings than with logic.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“B-but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, Enomoto-san is staring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s going on? She was also a bit awkward with me earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did I do something weird… Wait, I haven’t apologized for that fitting room incident earlier!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“H-Himari. Uh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, about earlier. I haven’t properly apologized yet…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah… Sorry, sorry. I didn’t notice at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As expected of Himari, she sensed what I wanted to say with just that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to apologize properly through Himari. She agreed to be a model, and it’s not cool if she feels bad because of me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari said to Enomoto-san,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m a little thirsty, so I’m going to go buy a drink at Tully’s over there. Enocchi, do you want something sweet?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wha, Himari!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari grinned and gave me a thumbs-up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hey, no one said, ‘I want to be alone with Enomoto-san, so leave the seat.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s with that satisfied look?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s not sensing anything. No, actually, maybe she’s doing this on purpose because she sensed it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi, Himari! You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is also training. You’re aiming to become an accessory craftsman who satisfies the customers, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Besides, I really am thirsty. So, good luck!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she left, she lightly tapped Enomoto-san’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You too, Enocchi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying something cryptic, Himari left the flower shop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What does she mean by ‘Enocchi too’?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, never mind that. Enomoto-san is definitely feeling uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari is such a troublesome person.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, yeah…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the way, Enomoto-san and her were friends from elementary school, right? Was Himari this pushy even when she was a child?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For now, I catch the mood with a common topic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari being the topic is super convenient for that. Although it only works with Enomoto-san, so it’s not very versatile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“When I used to go on my family deliveries, Hi-chan was a much quieter kid…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? I can’t imagine that at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She used to read picture books at the back of her room. Hi-chan’s mom told me to be friends with her…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow… So, it’s like the roles were reversed back then?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe. But she never really warmed up to me. I tried to lure her with candy, but she’d just take it and run away…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I wasn’t expecting it, it hit me pretty hard. As I try to hold back my laughter, Enomoto-san asks me anxiously.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s just that Himari’s actions are exactly like my cat Daifuku.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Daifuku?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s the name of my cat. We have a cat at home, and he’s attached to my sisters but never to me. Even when I show him treats, he just takes them and runs away. Just like elementary school Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that sounds nice. We deal with food at my house, so my mom says pets are a no-go…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why not keep a dog outside?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My mom got bitten by a dog when she was a child…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see. They think they’re playing, but their claws and fangs can be pretty scary.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I like cats, so I’m jealous.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, how about coming over sometime? Ever since my sisters got married and left, Daifuku has been looking bored…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sakunee-san is too lazy to play with Daifuku these days, and my parents are busy with work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for some reason, Daifuku never wants to play with me. I get a feeling like he’s saying, ‘I’d rather die than submit to you.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>
<p class="calibre5">??</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san’s cheeks suddenly flushed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why? Did I say something weird?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I screwed up. Now I sound like a guy trying to use my cat as an excuse to invite a girl over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait, wait. This is too soon. Well, it’s not even a matter of being too soon or not, I need to follow up!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Of course, I mean with Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, I see… thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Phew, safe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s not really safe, but let’s keep the conversation going.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Am I planning to just stand here in front of the display case waiting for Himari?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, what kind of flowers do you like, Enomoto-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m fine with anything…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The truth is, I want to cater to the model’s preferences this time. Sorry to trouble you with my circumstances, but I’d like to know your preferences if possible…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san seemed to be pondering seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After a moment, she quietly said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…The big ones.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You mean big flowers?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, yes. I like big flowers.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s easy to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such requests do seem important, and they’re easy to accommodate.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it makes her more satisfied, I’d like to hear as much as possible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“They might just suit you perfectly, Enomoto-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Look, Enomoto-san, you’re incredibly beautiful, right? The eye-catching type, I mean. Even with large flower accessories, I think you won’t be overshadowed. Actually, even though the Queen of the Night accessory is large, you perfectly make it your own… what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, Enomoto-san’s face turned bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She hid her mouth with the back of her hand and avoided showing her face to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Did I say something that bothered her with my explanation?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, this reaction is the same as when Himari teases her… Wait, maybe I’m really just flirting here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d been talking as if I was just chatting with Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, um, I didn’t mean it in a weird way…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I get it…you don’t have to say it every time…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for all the confusion…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is a major failure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since earlier, it’s like the brakes on my rationality are broken.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why? Normally, having a conversation like this with a girl other than Himari would be absolutely unthinkable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I’m internally trembling, Enomoto-san speaks up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“S-So, which one will it be?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, the conversation continues smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you. Enomoto-san looks difficult to get along with, but she’s really kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“A flower that’s large and has a theme of ‘love,’? In that case, a tulip with the language of flowers being ‘love’ or ‘compassion’ might be good…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You mean that tulip?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looks quite puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, that’s understandable. Tulips are popular, but because of that, their true nature isn’t well-known.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Tulips might seem to have a childish image because they’re often featured in children’s songs, but they’re actually quite sensual flowers when you see them. Look, they’re even displayed over here, in this showcase. This wine-red one, for instance, I think would suit you perfectly, Enomoto-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I point to a bouquet of multicolored tulips in the corner of the display case. Enomoto-san peers in with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The flowers are blooming as if they’re puckering their lips. The way the large petals overlap gives them a somewhat geometric, mysterious impression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re right. They do seem more mature…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The way they bloom can also change their impression.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They don’t all bloom the same way?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Tulips change the way they ‘open’ based on the temperature. The showcase keeps a constant temperature so they don’t change here, but you can really see it when they’re grown outside. I have a video from when Himari and I observed them all day once, so if you’re interested…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stop mid-sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s because Enomoto-san was staring at me with a blank expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I messed up again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. Conversations like this must be creepy for you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s always been that way. I was never interested in baseball or dramas. Maybe that’s why&mdash;&mdash;I’ve never been good with people and didn’t have friends. I’ve been told a million times that talking with me was boring.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In fact, my family had four females and two males, with a strong matriarchal tendency.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why they never really paid much attention to typical ‘boys’ activities.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both Dad and Mom were always busy. That couldn’t be helped.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That said, this had nothing to do with the world of children.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Girlish play is excluded, and on the other hand, the violent image of Nee-san and her friends was too strong for me to blend into girls’ society.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I really had no friends. I was always playing with flowers, and the only person who accepted this hobby of mine was probably Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll go pay for the tulips. Enomoto-san, could you please wait outside for Himari…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I tried to head to the cash register, I was stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around, I found Enomoto-san pinching the sleeve of my clothing with her finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looked up at me intently, asking with a voice that trembled faintly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why do you like flowers so much?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t expect to be asked that, but I can understand why she’d be curious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Plenty of people have asked me that before, usually to tease me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…do I have to tell you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I appreciate you being the model and all, but I really don’t want to share my personal life…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Tell me.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seriously?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is Enomoto-san one of those people who don’t read the room?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s a bit surprising… or maybe not. She does have a self-important vibe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t refuse Enomoto-san’s command, probably because she reminded me of my Nee-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I’m stared at by those beautiful as pearl eyes, I get nervous. My heart starts to race, my throat dries up. My body refused to cooperate, and I couldn’t even shake off her grip on my sleeve with her slender finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My eyes caught the flower accessory on her left wrist, something I made.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Queen of the Night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a beautiful flower that blooms only for one night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just before blooming, the bud faces upwards and unfolds its petals while exuding a fragrance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Contrary to its glamorous appearance, its scent is so intense. Many people seem to dislike it for being too distinctive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But once you get addicted to that smell, it’s over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You end up devoting all your energy to caring for the flower, all for the sake of an encounter that blooms only for a single night, just a few hours.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I looked into Enomoto-san’s serious eyes, such thoughts crossed my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I confessed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…when I was in elementary school, I went on a trip to a botanical garden in the next prefecture. You know the one? It’s near Yufu, in a hot spring town.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I know it. They use the warm ground to display tropical plants. Like cacti, giant water lilies…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her response came unusually quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe Enomoto-san has been there too?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I got separated from my sisters there. I had been searching for a long time, and I was exhausted in one of the greenhouses. That’s when I met a pretty girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was a black-haired girl in a white dress.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had no idea where she came from. She was lost too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was so cute and looked very timid. She was sitting in a corner of the greenhouse, crying all by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though I was also having a hard time being separated from my family, I ended up helping her find hers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She cried the entire time, and it made everything twice as hard for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But when she tightly grasped the hem of my clothing and wouldn’t let go… I just couldn’t leave her alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t wise enough to think that I should tell a staff member, so I just kept searching and eventually found her family… and then we said goodbye.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“She was being selfish, saying she wanted one of the displayed flowers. She was crying so much that I picked it for her. I knew it wasn’t allowed, but we were just kids. She held onto that flower, saying she’d take it home as a memory of today…but by the time we found her family, the flower had wilted.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Come to think of it, that was the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I became interested in flowers and eventually found a way to make them last longer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;If I could not only grow flowers but also process them skillfully… maybe, just maybe, I could reach her someday… Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said too much. All Enomoto-san wanted to know was why I liked flowers. I don’t need to tell her why I made accessories afterward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This story is admittedly too naive. Even Himari laughed at me a million times over.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s creepy, right? Now, I wish you’d let it go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I shook off Enomoto-san’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was a little concerned that I’d been too rough, but this is enough.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I never wanted to share this story with anyone else, and I’ve only ever told Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll go pay for the tulips now&mdash;&mdash;ugh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was pulled back again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, my collar was grabbed. The situation felt more life-threatening than before.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What is it, Enomoto-san? Do you find the story that funny&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I turned around and involuntarily fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san had a flushed face as if she was in a fever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She covered her mouth with the back of her left hand while her eyes were fixed on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was a hibiscus flower, wasn’t it? The flower the girl wanted to take home…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was stunned. She had guessed correctly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hibiscus.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A large red flower that blooms in tropical regions. It’s the state flower of Hawaii.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In Japan, you can see it in places like Okinawa.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Its flower language signifies ‘delicate beauty’…and ‘new love.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How do you know that? Did you hear it from Himari?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While avoiding my gaze, she spoke in an almost inaudible voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It was really beautiful. In the greenhouse, a whole wall of vivid red flowers was blooming. You said it resembled the girl’s reddish-black hair, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I think I said something like that, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Enomoto-san’s mouth relaxed a little. She gathered her hair and twirled it around her fingertips.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her glossy, reddish-black hair swayed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“She was happy to hear that word, so she wanted to take it home. That girl…she hated this reddish tint in her hair. She’s been mocked for its weird color since she was little. But since then, she has come to think it’s not so bad, um, what I’m trying to say is, uh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that point, she covered her face with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Queen of the Night accessory wrapped around my left wrist seemed to be smiling at us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun’s flower, it has reached her properly…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I involuntarily looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no way I could look at Enomoto-san’s face in this situation. I finally managed to say just this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you for telling me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san chuckled with an “Hehe.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was so cute that I thought my heart would burst.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My chest was pounding, and my body shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to describe this complicated feeling… I feel awkward to death, and I really wish Himari would come back soon.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It seems I’ve run into my first love again after seven years.</p>

<p class="calibre5">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">The day before yesterday at the bus stop, Enocchi said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Two years ago, when Onee-chan brought this Queen of the Night accessory home, I recognized it at first sight. I didn’t know why, but that boy from back then came to mind… He’s grown a bit though, it was surprising.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I listened to the story, I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I’d heard that story many times from Yuu. About the botanical garden, the girl in the dress&mdash;and the vivid red hibiscus.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could such a thing happen?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like something out of a manga. No, it’s impossible. What kind of odds would lead to something like this?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought it must be fate. What else could it be?</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Can I leave Yuu to Enocchi…?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Rather, I felt like I should.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had always thought that Yuu could only be left to someone who understood him, but I never thought it would be at this level.</p>


<p class="calibre5">She’s actually closer to Yuu than even a best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So I’ve made up my mind. I’m going to support this love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a clenched fist, I swore to the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As Yuu’s best friend, I’ll make sure it comes to fruition perfectly!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sorry, big brother(ani-ue)! Your future brother-in-law has found another place to go!</p>

<p class="calibre5">After leaving the flower shop, I went to Tully’s to buy a drink.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“First up is this&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I got an iced honey milk latte topped with plenty of fluffy cream.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Believe it or not, it’s Yuu’s favorite drink. That guy loves sweets, even though he has such a grumpy face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It must be fate that Enocchi’s family owns a pastry shop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A perfect match, huh?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Deliberately, I bought only one. And then I put in two straws.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is for Yuu and Enocchi to share.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I only have two arms, so I can only buy two drinks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no way I’m giving up my fruit tea, so it can’t be helped that Yuu and Enocchi have to share one.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s logic that even a grade-schooler could understand. Honestly… I wonder if they’ll try to drink together. Both of them are so earnest at heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They should feel awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And realize they see each other intensely as the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm. But Yuu is rather dense, he might just handle this situation calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, if that’s the case, so be it. I’d be satisfied just seeing Enocchi getting all embarrassed by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, we have a surplus of blushing beauty! My eyes are blessed; I won’t run out of material for a week!</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Now, I’m back at the flower shop, but…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t see Yuu and her. Maybe they’re still shopping.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When they’re done, they’ll probably be waiting in front of the store.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I peeked inside the shop. I could see the two of them standing side by side, engrossed in conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Huh. Unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought for sure they’d be wrapped in awkward silence. Yuu is surprisingly doing well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for now, let’s put an end to their alone time, because the cream will melt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu and the others are waiting for my miraculously cute smile!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu~! Hurry up and finish paying so we can move on… Oh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Feeling the tense atmosphere between the two, I instinctively hid behind a display case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi seemed to have captured Yuu in some way. I wonder what Yuu is talking about; looking like he’s caught by the scruff of his neck.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Ah…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Listening closely, I heard Enocchi’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun’s flower, it has reached her properly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Heat seemed to rise as Enocchi spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was almost like her own confession of love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes were so desperate that even I was captivated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Do girls become that adorable when they express feelings they’ve kept hidden for years?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t imagine a guy who wouldn’t be shaken after being confronted with such strong emotions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And Yuu… was really confused.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His usual stern expression was easily shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His face looked embarrassed and confused… but he definitely didn’t seem to dislike it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Of course not.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The girl of his first love appeared before him like this, and she had become as cute as Enocchi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s really like something out of a manga.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I realized I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe these two didn’t need my help after all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because they are connected by a destiny that meant they should meet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m so happy. There’s no way I wouldn’t celebrate when my dear best friend and my precious old acquaintance are promised such a happy future.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But why is it?</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Yuu is going far away…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I thought something like that, my feet involuntarily carried me out of the flower shop… Really, I wonder why…</p>
