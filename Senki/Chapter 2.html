<h1>Chapter 2: School Life</h1>


<p>—The next day. The second day of school life.</p>
<p>My body was still sore, but unfortunately I didn’t have Ms. Sakaki’s permission to skip class.</p>
<p>Unlike yesterday, I dragged my feet to the classroom at the last minute before being late. As I entered, numerous stares stabbed into me.</p>
<p>Most were sympathetic gazes at my battered state, but a few sent emotions closer to contempt than sympathy.</p>
<p>“Pfft—hey look, the loser arrives!”</p>
<p>Of course, the one who said that was the ever-cheerful Kirido. Nice and lively so early huh.</p>
<p>It seemed the fight yesterday had shifted the class hierarchy, as similar small fry had gathered around him, the confident leader.</p>
<p>They looked like a standard group of punks you’d see at any school. But since they were led by a rare overconfident guy and probably all had stronger powers than [Worsening Eyesight], they would be troublesome.</p>
<p>“Morning, Amamori-kun!”</p>
<p>“Ah, Kurashiki-san.”</p>
<p>Ignoring Kirido’s group, I headed to my seat when Kurashiki greeted me along the way. As class rep, she was a lively moodmaker. It was normal for someone like her to greet a mob character like me who got bullied, seen as ‘she’s so nice’…however—</p>
<p>“My, good morning Amamori-kun.”</p>
<p>The moment I heard that voice, I grimaced heavily.</p>
<p>Asahina, as dignified as ever, on her way to becoming the center of class after just one day… Here, ignoring her would lead to a repeat of yesterday, that was plain to see.</p>
<p>I knew greeting her would sour that guy’s mood, but still better than ignoring her I figured. With that in mind—</p>
<p>“Morning…”</p>
<p>The moment I returned the greeting, I keenly felt Kirido’s sharp gaze.</p>
<p>Inside, I heaved a huge sigh while ignoring his stare and arrived at my seat.</p>
<p>From here on out, the plan was to keep my head down.</p>
<p>Don’t get involved with or touch anyone. Become like the air, naturally present.</p>
<p>Don’t move first, and if someone else moves, blend into the flow inconspicuously.</p>
<p>Even if it meant a lonely gray high school life, I was plenty fine with avoiding annoying hassles.</p>
<p>As I thought that, I felt a gaze from beside me.</p>
<p>…With various bad premonitions, I averted my eyes towards the window.</p>
<p>“Amamori-kun, pardon me a moment.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not, so please don’t talk to me.”</p>
<p>I said that without meeting her eyes, but Asahina was staring at me in the glass window reflection. Glancing back, I saw Kirido also staring at me through the reflection, irritated. Do we make eye contact from this distance? Is that not allowed, sir?</p>
<p>Having no choice, I turned my gaze back to Asahina. She stared straight at my eyes—</p>
<p>“Amamori-kun was absent all yesterday, right? So you don’t know about the various explanations we received. Therefore—”</p>
<p>“Ahh, Asahina-san, Amamori-kun, time out!”</p>
<p>Before the hopeless premonition, a saving voice called out from somewhere.</p>
<p>The one who wedged between me and Asahina had familiar hairstyle.</p>
<p>Yup, it was Kurashiki-san who helped me out yesterday too.</p>
<p>She stood between us and shouted out an obvious fake voice.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll handle this…! Since I’m the rep! Leave it to me, Asahina-san!”</p>
<p>Then she whispered, inaudible to Kirido.</p>
<p>(Asahina-san, it’s fine if you want to talk to Amamori-kun, but you can’t in front of Kirido-kun! Or it’ll be just like yesterday!)</p>
<p>At her whisper, Asahina’s eyes widened in realization.</p>
<p>With just her gaze, she looked back at the last row by the window—where displeased Kirido sat, and Asahina’s mood clearly worsened.</p>
<p>“Y-You’re right… My apologies. Please take care of it.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Leave it to me, Asahina-san!”</p>
<p>Kurashiki said that and thumped her chest. Her two massive meat lumps jiggled, eliciting great sighs from the boys. Well, stuff like that didn’t interest me so I didn’t react.</p>
<p>…I mean, I looked a little, but not in that way. Yeah.</p>
<p>Kurashiki-san puts her mouth to my ear, whether she knows I’m looking at her or not.</p>
<p>So, I ended up having to show them around… but it seems Asahina-san also wants to talk, so, after school, when no one’s around, that’s okay, right?”</p>
<p>“Well… I suppose so.”</p>
<p>As long as Kirido isn’t around, there’s no reason to avoid Asahina-san. I nodded with that thought in mind, and Kurashiki-san responded with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>“Great! From the next break, I’ll teach you everything!”</p>
<p>With that, she energetically ran off. After watching her leave, I turned my gaze back to Asahina-san, who had a troubled expression.</p>
<p>“Dreams are about being a hero, right? It’s tough, aiming for a profession that only exists in fantasies.”</p>
<p>I genuinely think Asahina-san is trying her best. The timing of her saving me yesterday was likely the result of a lot of thought and deliberation.</p>
<p>That she called out to me this way was honestly appreciated too.</p>
<p>However—that’s only if the man named Kirido didn’t exist.</p>
<p>A hero of justice cannot see their own classmate as an enemy. Especially on just the second day of school life, she would see me as just an ally in trouble, and aim to re-educate me.</p>




<p>It’s quite—naive, I think, but.</p>
<p>“—I’m sorry, Amamori-kun.”</p>
<p>At the apology I heard, I quietly averted my gaze.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it…. I don’t expect anything from anyone to begin with.”</p>
<p>To trust in strangers, at least for me, is inconceivable.</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>“So with that said, I’ll teach Amamori-kun lots of things!”</p>
<p>“Ohh!”</p>
<p>And so, during lunch break. A small lounge leading to the roof.</p>
<p>Kurashiki, who seemed to truly intend to teach me various things instead of improvising lies, called me out energetically and said that. Which is fine, but—</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Eh, is it a problem if I’m here?”</p>
<p>The one who came putting his arm around my shoulder with a grin was Karasuma, who I’d talked with yesterday too.</p>
<p>Why were he and Kirido’s group so different despite both being delinquent types?</p>
<p>Facial symmetry? Are good-looking guys these days nice too? He’s talking to me casually despite no relation to Kirido. Just that makes me understand how good of a guy Karasuma is—</p>
<p>“Rather, no way I’d let the class madonna be alone with a guy!”</p>
<p>…I take that back. He might have just wanted to get close to Kurashiki.</p>
<p>I heaved a sigh, and seeing me like that, Kurashiki brought her face nearer.</p>
<p>“Come on, liven up! Since it’s such a gloomy academy! We should be cheerful when talking together as friends!”</p>
<p>She’s right. In this academy life ruled by school regulations, it’s gloomy as-is. We should at least be bright when with frien—friends? Huh, when did I become friends with these guys?</p>
<p>Could friendships form so naturally without me realizing? As that doubt crossed my mind, deliberately voicing it would just worsen the mood.</p>
<p>Without interfering, I prompted her to continue. Kurashiki took out an A4 sized paper.</p>
<p>“Ta-da! A list of things to teach Amamori-kun! I thought up lots of stuff during class! It’s a secret from the teachers!”</p>
<p>On the back of a familiar printout were all sorts of things written in cute handwriting. To think she made something like this during class… Wait a second?</p>
<p>“That important document Ms. Sakaki handed out…”</p>
<p>“Don’t fuss over minor details!”</p>
<p>Saying that, she sat down at the long table set up in the lounge.</p>
<p>Karasuma and I also took our seats across from her. She passed that printout to us.</p>
<p>“Here! Ms. Sakaki’s talk, this covers most of it!”</p>
<p>And so I looked over the printout she handed me—</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>Top 5 things I want to tell Amamori-kun!</p>
<p>⓵ First!</p>
<p>I heard we get a living allowance paid monthly at this school! It’s based on stuff like your daily behavior and grades! The next payment’s a month away though, so let’s use our money wisely! Oh, and if you want a part-time job, you have to pass the school’s really strict interview! Ms. Sakaki said it’s “tough”!</p>
<p>⓶ Second!</p>
<p>It’s about the esper abilities at this academy! Abilities are divided into around four types. Normal abilities like Amamori-kun’s and Kirido-kun’s are fourth-rank. Names with ‘King’ are third-rank, and with ‘Blessing’ are second-rank! Asahina-san’s [Blessing of the Thunder God] is like the strongest at school! It’s got a god’s name and all!</p>
<p>⓷ Third!</p>
<p>There’s no class shuffling over the 3 years here! So we’ll stay as Class 2-C, Class 3-C, and so on! Oh, and there are rumors Class A has the most excellent students gathered each grade! Though it’s just a rumor so it’s better not to mind it!</p>
<p>⓸ Fourth!</p>
<p>Looks like we aren’t allowed to leave school grounds after all. Since outside communication is impossible too, we can’t do stuff like post on SNS if anything happens! Looks like we can’t have a normal youth! Did you use stuff like Twitter, Amamori-kun?</p>
<p>⓹ Fifth!</p>
<p>Sorry for laughing at your esper power at first!</p>
<p>I just have a very weak physical enhancement, so we’re the same with fourth-rank powers!</p>
<p>Everyone in class also said sorry for laughing at you! They’re too scared to say it in front of Kirido-kun, but they really did, so I want you to believe that! Looks like you’ve got quite a lot of allies!</p>
<p>Presented by Kurashiki Hotaru!</p>

<p>“what’s this”<br /> <br />Was my first impression after reading the printout. Glancing beside me, Karasuma looking over the printout also had a complex expression, while the one who made it was the only one puffing her chest confidently.<br /> <br />“How is it! And I wanna be a novelist in the future! Ehehe!”<br /> <br />“No way, impossible with this…”<br /> <br />Karasuma immediately replied from beside me. Kurashiki’s eyes went wide at his words. She seemed clearly shocked as she dropped her shoulders.<br /> <br />“Wha—No way… And I was so confident.”<br /> <br />Seeing the crestfallen Kurashiki, I turned my gaze to Karasuma.<br /> <br />He gave me a look like ‘Huh, I’m the bad guy!?’ but no, you’re the bad guy here. Even I read the mood. Show some consideration.<br /> <br />“While there’s lots I want to say… two things in particular. First, it says there are four types of abilities, but what’s that unwritten ‘top-ranking’ one?”<br /> <br />“Oh, that. Ms. Sakaki said it’s ‘purely hypothetical, just imaginary speculation’. A kind of urban legend. She said it’s an absolutely impossible thing in reality. Less likely than encountering thirty shiny Poke*mon in a row.”<br /> <br />“That’s… yeah, looks fine hypothetical.”<br /> <br />What ridiculous odds. Hearing that, we can consider Blessings to be the de facto top-rank right? On top of that, among them, an ability blessed by the mightiest god—Asahina’s power might be in the top five or so at this academy.<br /> <br />“So what’s that other thing you wanted to mention?”<br /> <br />“Hm? Ah… No, it’s nothing. Don’t mind it.”<br /> <br />I said that and returned the printout to her.<br /> <br />…The ‘other’ thing I wavered on asking that I really wanted to know was:……I really wanted to ask “one more thing” that I was wondering whether to ask.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“If we quit this school, will we be able to return home safely? 』<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In the past two years, several students withdrew from this academy.<br /> <br />And every one of them has gone missing… according to a rumor.<br /> <br />But seeing how this academy operates, it makes you wonder, ‘Really?’<br /> <br />Could that actually be just a rumor? The disappearances are real, and the academy covered it up?<br /> <br />I shouldn’t be the only one harboring such doubts. Surely the fact that not one student has voluntarily withdrawn proves this. …They too must have some uneasy feelings deep down.<br /> <br />—That if they left this academy, they might not be able to safely return.<br /> <br />Missing persons and the like were just ‘urban legends’ before enrolling.<br /> <br />I knew they were just rumors, and only used them to reassure myself when entering.<br /> <br />But now that I know what this school is like, they aren’t laughable information.<br /> <br />Once you’ve enrolled, there is no way to safely return until graduation.<br /> <br />I resolved myself to at least that extent when I saw the brochure.<br /> <br />…Well, not something I’d discuss here, so I’ll keep it unsaid.<br /> <br />“Thank you Kurashiki-san, that taught me a lot.”<br /> <br />“You’re welcome! …I feel like I said more stuff too, but the details can come later! Feel free to ask anytime!”<br /> <br />“Okay, question—Kurashiki-san, do you have a boyfriend or anything?”<br /> <br />“No comment on questions like that, Karasuma-kun!”<br /> <br />As those two laughed together pleasantly, I recalled the printout’s contents.<br /> <br />There wasn’t anything particularly unnatural or out of place in the wording but… leaving halfway through the most explanatory day, the first day of school life, really hurt. Maybe I shouldn’t have provoked Kirido so much.<br /> <br />As I thought about that, my gaze inadvertently left the two and glanced down the hall.<br /> <br />Idly looking towards the hall, I discovered—<br /> <br />“Wha—!?”<br /> <br />A woman peeking from the corner of the hall staring at us, sending a chill down my spine.<br /> <br />With waist-length black hair and bloodshot eyes, she wore this school’s uniform with a red ribbon. Undoubtedly a first-year… Once I calmly determined that, I finally realized—<br /> <br />“Hey, Karasuma-kun.”<br /> <br />“Huh? What’s up all of a sud—ooh!?”<br /> <br />When I pointed at the figure, Karasuma saw it and screamed.<br /> <br />But after properly looking at the person, he muttered softly.<br /> <br />“Huh, Asahina…-san?”<br /> <br />The black-haired monster reacted with a start.<br /> <br />Kurashiki looked back curiously at where we were watching, but at the same time, the black hair receded into the depths of the hall. Then fake coughs, “Ahem, ahem.”<br /> <br />A few seconds later, the flawless Asahina Kasumi emerged from the other end of the hall.<br /> <br />“Oh my. What a coincidence everyone! I just happened to pass by here!”<br /> <br />“””…Just happened to?”””<br /> <br />Karasuma’s and my voices overlapped.<br /> <br />Only Kurashiki, who hadn’t seen directly, was lost and tilting her head… No, maybe it was better she didn’t see. It was quite a horrific horror scene.<br /> </p>



<p>Uh, Asahina-san, you’re aiming to be a hero of justice… right?<br /> <br />That’s stalki—no, I won’t conclude yet. It’s only the first time. Calling her a pervert based just on this would be too hasty. Still too early. Probably. Surely!<br /> <br />“But I’m glad! It seems the necessary information reached Amamori-kun! Of course I wasn’t listening to your conversation or anything. I just happened to pass by, that’s all!”<br /> <br />“Yeah…well, sure.”<br /> <br />Unable to say anything, I gave such an ambiguous reply.<br /> <br />As Asahina sat beside Kurashiki, I clearly saw Karasuma’s cheek twitch.<br /> <br />Idiot—don’t show it on your face! Right now I’m also unsure whether this girl is the hero of justice she appears to be, or a bothersome woman with half-twisted stalker tendencies. This isn’t the time to give away information to her!<br /> <br />“Karasuma.”<br /> <br />I jabbed his side with my elbow so he’d shut up. His reaction was excessive.<br /> <br />“Ow! W-What the hell, Amamori-kun! Oh yeah, I just remembered something to do—sorry Kurashiki-san, Asahina-san, gotta go!”<br /> <br />He said that smoothly and energetically stood up.<br /> <br />I tried to grab Karasuma’s arm reflexively but he got away just a bit faster.<br /> <br />What danger-sensing ability. And that fleet-footed escape at the crucial moment.<br /> <br />Before I knew it, Karasuma had sprinted to the other end of the hall, and I grit my teeth.<br /> <br />That bastard… abandoned me as a sacrifice to get away!<br /> <br />“W-What’s wrong with Karasuma-kun…?”<br /> <br />What do you mean what’s wrong with him? It’s you. You’re the problem.<br /> <br />I put my hand to my forehead and heaved a sigh, then opened my mouth to Asahina.<br /> <br />“What will you do if Kirido sees this…?”<br /> <br />“Don’t worry. I rushed here using my power. In terms of speed, I’m invincible. No one can keep up, and they can’t even trace where I went in the first place.”<br /> <br />I see. If she uses her power, I can’t run away—is how it is.<br /> <br />“Rather, have you two eaten your lunches?<br /> <br />Saying that, Asahina took out the lunchbox she’d brought. Did she make it herself? If doing that saves on money, maybe I should try it too—and so on. My thoughts swayed in a completely different direction from the fear.<br /> <br />“Now that you mention it, I haven’t eaten yet—let’s eat, Amamori-kun.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Ah, yes.”<br /> <br />Seen from outside, a dream lunch with two of the class’s great beauties!<br /> <br />Seen from inside, a hellish lunch with a bothersome girl and another I don’t understand.<br /> <br />…Here, I made a resolution.<br /> <br />I’ll definitely get back at that Karasuma later.<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />And so time passed, and before I knew it, it was after school.<br /> <br />Having come to the stairs leading to the roof again, I turned my gaze away from the girl before me.<br /> <br />“Keep it short if you wanna talk. I’m not that free.”<br /> <br />In truth that was a lie. Amamori Yuuto has loads of free time.<br /> <br />With just Kurashiki and Karasuma as friends, even getting two friends on the second day of school life meant I was blessed with more than enough. Facing that escapist reality, the girl before me nervously fiddled with her hair.<br /> <br />“You’re right, sorry for taking up your time.”<br /> <br />What Kurashiki told me before, about ‘creating time to talk with Asahina after school’. That.<br /> <br />Weren’t we able to talk plenty over lunch? I also considered it might not be talk that could just be tacked on during lunch.<br /> <br />“Um… Are you okay, Amamori-kun? Your body…”<br /> <br />“I’ll manage, thanks to you.”<br /> <br />My body was close to fully recovered.<br /> <br />Thanks to the nurse’s first aid and the mysterious medicine.<br /> <br />And Asahina stopping it at that timing. If the fight had dragged on longer, it might have endangered my very life.<br /> <br />“I’m grateful you stopped it. Thank you for worrying about me.”<br /> <br />“It’s not like I’m in a position to be thanked but…”<br /> <br />Asahina was strangely flustered. What was making her so nervous? Watching her like that, she muttered out,<br /> <br />“S-Sorry… I’m not very eloquent right now. This is my first time with something like this, so I don’t know how I should say it…”<br /> <br />“Something like this…?”<br /> <br />I questioned, then immediately realized. It was about Kirido.<br /> <br />In elementary and middle school, I didn’t see many guys who were really warped like that. However badly they acted, even if they formed some terrifying group with their ilk, they were ultimately just a disorderly mob.<br /> <br />Not even a confession, just a girl greeting someone else was enough to make him want to beat the crap out of them—the idea of someone with such twisted thinking probably didn’t exist much in this wide world. With no backing yet… What does he think and live for?<br /> <br />Putting it into words made me seriously worry about Kirido’s mental state.<br /> <br />“Kirido-kun is probably irritated that I’m paying attention to you. And he probably thinks it would all be resolved if I didn’t talk to you.”<br /> <br />“Glad you understand quickly. Then our talk is over.”<br /> <br />Saying that, I started to leave.<br /> <br />But in the next moment, lightning streaked across the edge of my vision—and I found Asahina gripping my arm.<br /> <br />…With speed like that initially, at top speed she might even approach natural lightning speed?</p>

<p>Even just two days into school life without full control, considering her potential that power is fearsome… Though well, whatever, it’s not of particular interest.<br /> <br />As I tried to shake her off and Asahina gripped firmly, for a brief moment it turned into a contest of strength between us.<br /> <br />But I couldn’t imagine beating her when she had her esper power, so I sighed and released my strength.<br /> <br />“Didn’t I just say? Kirido likes you so he doesn’t like me, Amamori Yuuto, who you pay attention to. His dissatisfaction with you talking to me is resulting in violence against me. That’s all there is to the current situation. It’s extremely simple.”<br /> <br />“It’s not…simple at all.”<br /> <br />Her squeezed-out words. The true feelings shown by the ‘girl’ claiming to be a hero of justice.<br /> <br />“I… want to become a hero of justice. My childhood dream still has not faded. I will definitely become the kind of hero who rushes to help those in need, saving them with a smile.”<br /> <br />“It’s a splendid dream.”<br /> <br />“Yes, thank you.”<br /> <br />She expressed her gratitude without changing her expression.<br /> <br />But you know, Asahina Kasumi, in regards to this case, dreams like that are irrelevant.<br /> <br />You yourself are partially causing this.<br /> <br />Then if Asahina wasn’t the cause, everything would be resolved just by that. It’s that simple.<br /> <br />…But from the flow of conversation, it doesn’t seem it’ll be that easy.<br /> <br />“I don’t want to gloss over the problem. I want to resolve it, Amamori-kun. I don’t want to postpone the issue by not contacting you. Through discussion between you, me, and Kirido-kun, finding points we can compromise on… I’d like us to get along as classmates if possible.”<br /> <br />“It really is a splendid dream.”<br /> <br />The same response as before. But the meaning I imbued it with was vastly different.<br /> <br />“You can theoretically restrain that rampaging horse with logic and all. But that’s also ‘postponing the issue’ like you said, isn’t it, Asahina-san? With dissatisfaction just building up, nothing gets resolved.”<br /> <br />Resolving means eliminating the cause.<br /> <br />In this case, either Asahina herself, or expelling Kirido from this academy.<br /> <br />Put frankly, disciplinary expulsion.<br /> <br />Luckily, this academy’s rules have expulsion tied to them left and right. She’s not stupid enough to be unable to use those to get Kirido expelled.<br /> <br />“Or are you telling me to drop out of this school?”<br /> <br />“I-I’m not saying that!”<br /> <br />Asahina’s voice echoed, and I narrowed my eyes. Her body shrank further under my sharp gaze, but the will dwelling in her eyes didn’t waver in the slightest.<br /> <br />“I don’t want anyone, not you or I or Kirido-kun, to leave the academy, and I want to resolve all the issues. That is the first step on my path as a hero. At least until this issue is settled, I will protect you from everything else.”<br /> <br />Hearing her words, I couldn’t help but close my eyes.<br /> <br />Because to me, Asahina’s words were too dazzling.<br /> <br />Being able to speak of ideals is a splendid talent. You can strive towards that ‘destination’ you envision.<br /> <br />That is surely Asahina Kasumi’s innate gift, which nothing can replace.<br /> <br />Acquired efforts can exceed inborn gifts. She will surely become stronger than anyone someday.<br /> <br />I had that premonition… However.<br /> <br />I send this to her, fully indicating my understanding.<br /> <br />“Gonna hurl, Asahina Kasumi.”<br /> <br />I opened my eyes. She looked up at me with eyes wide.<br /> <br />“You can’t talk of reality with ideals alone. If you’re chasing dreams, you have no place in reality.”<br /> <br />Dreams are ideal, and reality is cruel.<br /> <br />Common knowledge we’ve had since birth. What anyone knows.<br /> <br />The moment you go against that common sense—I can clearly see where you’re headed.<br /> <br />Ruin, Asahina Kasumi. Alone, you will definitely be smashed to pieces.<br /> <br />“You will definitely fail soon. Clenching your teeth, unable to accomplish anything.”<br /> <br />You will grow stronger… But this time, that time isn’t now.<br /> <br />I’d bet on it. You won’t be able to resolve this Kirido issue. You can’t deal with that scoundrel. A hero of justice can’t judge their own friend.<br /> <br />You will remain completely outside—and by the time you realize, it will already be too late.<br /> <br />I turned my back on her and started walking.<br /> <br />Her gaze didn’t leave me even as I walked away, so I quickened my pace.<br /> <br />…This is also my belief, but.<br /> <br />Justice defeats evil, but enormous evil also defeats justice.<br /> <br />When hostages are taken and you lack the information to get them back, surrounded by superior enemies threatening you and such, you’re cornered.<br /> <br />Reality isn’t as sweet as fantasy. There are limits to how far pure justice takes you.<br /> <br />“Typhoons will eventually sputter out.”<br /> <br />Reality won’t move from pretty words alone.<br /> <br />What moves reality—is always ugly human ego, like mud.<br /> <br />In order for Asahina Kasumi to shine… correspondingly ugly darkness will be necessary, I think.<br /> <br />At least, Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />You should fundamentally confirm that even a hero of justice is human.<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />The next day. The third day of school life. Around when the pain was finally fading from my body.<br /> <br />Arriving relatively late, the classroom atmosphere felt a bit gloomy that day.<br /> <br />The classroom, usually filled with chatting classmates, was somehow quiet.<br /> <br />Maybe someone pulled a prank on the desks? Thinking that, I headed to my seat but the brand new, flawless desk welcomed me as usual.<br /> <br />If it wasn’t related to me… Kirido? Did he cause more trouble?<br /> <br />Puzzled, I glanced beside me and the self-proclaimed hero of justice had already arrived at school.<br /> <br />However, I again felt a sense of discomfort from the atmosphere she gave off.<br /> <br />How to put it, it was a similar air to when my power was laughed at on the first day.<br /> <br />Concisely, an aura of anger. It was rising from her entire body—<br /> <br />“Morning all—Huh!? The hell’s this!?”<br /> <br />Kirido’s huge angry yell echoed from the back of the classroom.<br /> <br />Looking back, a crowd had formed in front of Kirido’s seat in the last row by the window. Pushing through them and seeing his desk, Kirido’s face steadily twisted in shock and anger.<br /> <br />“What is…”<br /> <br />Saying that much, Kirido’s gaze captured me.<br /> <br />Great anger dwelled in his eyes, and I unconsciously tensed up at the unexpected hostility.<br /> <br />“Amamori…! It was you right!? There’s no one else who’d do this crap resenting me! You’re the only one who’d do this resenting me for punching you!”<br /> <br />“What are you suddenly…”<br /> <br />As I walked over to the enraged Kirido, his desk naturally entered my vision—I opened my eyes wide.<br /> <br />‘Idiot Kirido!’ ‘Die, violent punk!’ ‘Pick one, punk or delinquent!’<br /> <br />‘You know you’re not that cool, right?’ ‘Ugly yet acting cool, dumbass lol’<br /> <br />‘Simply annoying, disturbing our studies. Disappear, Kirido.’<br /> <br />Countless insults were carved into his desk.<br /> <br />Each line was engraved in a different handwriting, and unlike writing in permanent marker, the letters carved as if with a carving knife wouldn’t disappear without replacing the desk.<br /> <br />“What is this?”<br /> <br />“Don’t play dumb! There’s no one else in this damn class who resents me enough to do this persistent crap! Or are you saying one of you bastards did it!? Huh!?”<br /> <br />Kirido’s yelled loudly. Drawn by the volume, rubberneckers gathered from other classes, and some classmates grimaced, covering their ears.<br /> <br />Their expressions showed distaste towards Kirido.<br /> <br />From this situation, it didn’t seem a classmate had done it.<br /> <br />…But who did?<br /> <br />Stroking my chin in thought—in the next moment, a fist plunged into my face.<br /> <br />Along with the powerful impact, I was forcefully blown back.<br /> <br />“Amamori-kun!? What are you doing, Kirido-kun!”<br /> <br />I could hear Asahina’s flustered voice.<br /> <br /><em>Drip</em>, something fell onto my uniform so I looked down, and… blood was dripping from my uniform nose.<br /> <br />“H-Hold it, Kirido-kun! That’s going too far!”<br /> <br />“Punching without even evidence is just—!”<br /> <br />Two of Kirido’s followers yelled. …Looks like I got punched again.<br /> <br />“Shaddup! There’s no way anyone else in this damn class resents me enough to do something this persistent! Or are you bastards saying you did it!? Huh!?”<br /> <br />“W-Well…”<br /> <br />“N-Not exactly…”<br /> <br />Come on, give me a bit more of a fight. I’m innocent here, yet I’m getting punched. I’m starting to get irritated, though you can’t tell from my expressionless face.<br /> <br />I wiped my nosebleed and stood up, finding Asahina-san in front of me, protecting me.<br /> <br />Kurashiki-san came over and supported my body from the side.<br /> <br />“Y-you okay? Amamori-kun…”<br /> <br />“Well, somehow.”<br /> <br />It had to happen on the day my wounds had finally healed.<br /> <br />I couldn’t help but feel a bit down, but it was just that.<br /> <br />I didn’t feel like seeking revenge or even see the need for it.<br /> <br />In the end, it would be a pointless waste of effort. Because…<br /> <br />“You’re quite lively today, Kirido Hashiru.”<br /> <br />At the sound of the voice, Kirido’s shoulders jumped noticeably.<br /> <br />At the entrance to the classroom stood Ms. Sakaki, and her eyes were sharper than usual.<br /> <br />“‘Article 5. Violence towards students and teachers is prohibited. Students violating this will, unless forgiven by the victim, receive either fines according to the severity of violence, or expulsion, or other measures.'”<br /> <br />“Are you prepared for the consequences?”<br /> <br />Simply put, unless the victim forgives, there’s a fine. And with the degree of severity, at minimum a 100,000 yen fine, so if you can’t pay it means expulsion—is probably how it is.<br /> <br />“W-What the hell, I ain’t heard of that crap! No rules like that!”<br /> <br />“Whether you knew or not doesn’t change you broke the rules. Not knowing will be treated as you disregarding the rules. And unilateral violence without evidence… Be prepared for at least 200,000, Kirido.”<br /> <br />Personally the bigger thing is ‘his surname is Hashiru, huh’, but looks like now isn’t the time to be impressed by Kirido’s unsuitable surname.<br /> <br />“O-Oi Amamori! I dunno what’s goin’ on but if you forgive me the fine’ll disappear right! Say you forgive me dammit! You’re only useful for stuff like this, so at least contribute something to the class, dumbass!”<br /> <br />Wow, what verbal abuse. I almost reflexively shouted ‘Like hell I’d forgive you, dumbass!!’<br /> <br />But getting into a fight would be a pain.<br /> <br />And what Ms. Sakaki said… minimum 200,000 yen.<br /> <br />Recalling those words, I thought for a bit.<br /> <br />As a result, I sent words completely opposite my true feelings.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…Fine, I’ll let it slide this time.”</p>

<p>My words left the class dumbfounded.<br /> <br />Even Ms. Sakaki, who was full of intent to punish him, was surprised. Asahina had such an idiotic look of shock. …Though only on the inside since my face doesn’t show expressions.<br /> <br />“Alright! That’s what I’m talkin’ about! Oi Amamori! I’ll remember you did that crap to my desk later, got it punk!”<br /> <br />And with that Kirido returned to his seat.<br /> <br />The graffitied desk was swapped with follower A’s desk, so unfortunately follower A would have to use that bullied desk for class from now on. Don’t mind, no sympathy though.<br /> <br />“Oi… Amamori. I thought you were insane when I heard your self-introduction, but… What are you really thinking? Or are you just stupid?”<br /> <br />“That’s awful phrasing… but I won’t deny it.”<br /> <br />Somehow she’d come over nearby and was supporting my body from the opposite side of Kurashiki… Though if possible, I want her to dote on me more. Don’t keep calling me stupid. It pierces deeply since it’s true.<br /> <br />“You should have wrung 200,000 out of him, leaving just 100,000, squeezed him with this and that until he crumbled, then watched happily as he weakened.”<br /> <br />“You have an awful personality, don’t you?”<br /> <br />I retorted to her deranged line. I deeply breathed out.<br /> <br />“But… seems Kirido is being bullied, doesn’t it?”<br /> <br />Muttering that, surely they heard it within earshot.<br /> <br />Luckily Kirido didn’t hear since he was yelling at his followers, but still no one answered my words.<br /> <br />But with just that line, doubt had surely arisen in everyone’s hearts.<br /> <br />[Kirido is disliked by someone in class]<br /> <br />It would continue smoldering as a dark flame in each of their hearts, and the next time Kirido caused trouble again, it would elevate to negative feelings towards him.<br /> <br />Well, with him shouting and making a racket in class now, there might already be students thinking ‘I don’t like him’.<br /> <br />“Well whatever.”<br /> <br />Kirido Hashiru. The number one problem child in class. The unstable element of Class 1-C. Getting in my face every chance he gets, obsessed with Asahina Kasumi, repeating self-centered words and actions without considering others. That dumbass.<br /> <br />Thinking that far—I sneered.<br /> <br />“Nn…”<br /> <br />I heard Ms. Sakaki swallow her breath beside me.<br /> <br />I wonder if I’m properly smiling right now?<br /> <br />Well, I’m fully aware of that already so…<br /> <br />Don’t really care either way, but Kirido.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–You’ve gone a bit overboard.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It would have been fine if you just had feelings for Asahina.<br /> <br />If you had just punched me that first time in class then left it at that, it still would have been fine.<br /> <br />But acts of violence against unrelated third parties for reasons you’re completely unaware of—to be frank, I can’t overlook that. It’s started grating on my ears and eyes.<br /> <br />He’s still shouting even now.<br /> <br />Haven’t you played around quite a bit? Wallowed in school life however you liked?<br /> <br />It’s fine already Kirido. I don’t think you’re that bad, but.<br /> <br />I think it’s about time I crush you… and it’ll be fine right?<br /> <br />But don’t worry. I’m much ‘kinder’ than Ms. Sakaki.<br /> <br />I won’t say cruel things like 200,000 yen.<br /> <br />I’ll just sneer and tell you to come closer.<br /> <br />I’ll permit you resisting.<br /> <br />So go ahead and do as you please. And I’ll freely finish you off.<br /> <br />Put simply, that’s all there is to it.<br /> <br />“Amamori. Come to the teachers’ office at lunch. I need to talk.”<br /> <br />Looking down at me with an unusually serious face, Ms. Sakaki.<br /> <br />“What a coincidence. I also… had things I wanted to ask you, Teacher.”<br /> <br />She tensed her expression at my reply. With a glance at Kirido, she soon sighed as if giving up on something.<br /> <br />“Fine. I hope for a peaceful talk.”<br /> <br />Don’t worry, Teacher.<br /> <br />I’ve never once hurt another person in my life.<br /> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />And so at lunch break that day, I was called to the teachers’ office.<br /> <br />However, it was a school-wide broadcast. And the content was terrible.<br /> <br />‘Ah, testing, testing. Year 1 Class C’s Amamori Yuuto. Year 1 Class C’s Amamori Yuuto. I will not permit rejection on the grounds of aching cheeks from continual punching. I have investigated and confirmed you have no friends to eat with at lunch. Come to the teachers’ office as soon as possible. I repeat—’<br /> <br />And it repeated about five times.<br /> <br />I ran into the broadcast room next to the teachers’ office around the sixth repetition, forcibly stopped the broadcast, then was shown to a reception room in the corner of the teachers’ office.<br /> <br />“Out of pity for your loneliness I invited you to lunch. You should weep in gratitude.”<br /> <br />“Yes, I nearly cried several times on my way here.”<br /> <br />The ongoing slandering of me as I headed to the broadcast room.<br /> <br />And piling on more and more groundless lies each time, the later parts were a storm of verbal abuse that made me want to cover my ears, and even with a straight face I definitely cried inside a little. No actual tears but I definitely cried mentally.<br /> <br />“So, what business? I was planning to come even without the broadcast.”<br /> <br />Asking while opening the bread I bought from the school store.<br /> <br />Looking over, she had… I envy her, must have ordered delivery. Noisily slurping ramen, soup was splattering all over her pure white lab coat. It bothered me how it got dirty sometimes but Ms. Sakaki, you’re a woman, pay a little more attention to your appearance!<br /> <br />“I just… wanted to find out your true motives. Oh, this isn’t the school’s stance, just my personal interest. So no matter how much you badmouth the school, I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it. I swear that much on my mother and sister.”<br /> <br />“Haah…”<br /> <br />How trustworthy are your mother and sister? My true intentions…?<br /> <br />I simply want to live inconspicuously, without getting involved with anyone, peacefully yet freely.<br /> <br />Nothing really comes to mind beyond that.<br /> <br />“If forced to say… Aren’t the rules too harsh? They’re strict to begin with, yet breaking just one means at least a 100,000 yen fine… Did the Headmaster lose his mind?”<br /> <br />Telling her bluntly, she smiled wryly.<br /> <br />“Don’t ever say that outside. And I can neither affirm nor deny it. The Headmaster —Yagumo Sento is at the pinnacle even among teachers, the so-called [Academy’s God]. The supreme, greatest [Absolute] in this place. Even we can’t defy him.”<br /> <br />“Oh, the Headmaster is…”<br /> <br />I gave a short reply and bit into the bread…. Yeah, cheap stuff, my mouth’s all dry.<br /> <br />As I looked to her hoping she’d at least give me a drink—<br /> <br />“Hm? You want to eat, the ramen?”<br /> <br />“Don’t need your half-eaten stuff.”<br /> <br />What misunderstanding made her say that?<br /> <br />Somehow… I really don’t understand this person well. Does she want to dominate the students as a teacher, or does she have some resentment towards the academy, or maybe she’s just not thinking anything at all, or perhaps—<br /> <br />“Well… I’ll answer anything about my true intentions, but before that, can I ask just one thing?”<br /> <br />Prefacing that, I bluntly said to her.<br /> <br />“Ms. Sakaki, actually there’s one thing I want to borrow money for.”<br /> <br />“Something you want to borrow? Is it my belonging, or the academy’s property?”<br /> <br />“The latter. It’s in this school building.”<br /> <br />I glanced around. There were presences but they kept their distance, and no sign any were eavesdropping… Well, even if they heard it wouldn’t particularly matter.<br /> <br />“Actually—”<br /> <br />And so I proposed it.<br /> <br />As she listened to my words, Ms. Sakaki’s expression tensed up.<br /> <br />In these three years, had any student ever made a proposal like this at this time?<br /> <br />No, I’d assert there definitely hadn’t been any. With information on the academy still insufficient early on, the standard play would be to use your funds prudently. Anyone would think that way.<br /> <br />But certainly having close to 500,000 yen on hand early on was also a huge initial advantage.<br /> <br />If you avoided the initial fine.<br /> <br />You could live for about a month even after some huge spending.<br /> <br />“So, can you lend it to me?”<br /> <br />“I think it’s possible… However, it’ll be 300,000 yen.”<br /> <br />“That’s not expensive. I’d still have 180,000 left.”<br /> <br />She sighed in amazement at my retort.<br /> <br />“Fine. I think you’re insane, but I’ll take care of the procedure. You should be able to use it without issue starting tomorrow morning. I’ll deduct it from your balance.”<br /> <br />“Thank you very much. You’re a great help.”<br /> <br />Not necessarily essential but… there’s a big difference having it versus not.<br /> <br />Having gotten her pledge, I carefreely brushed off her questions afterwards as well, at times asking some questions myself, spending a rather meaningful time.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />And before I realized, it was already the end of lunch break.<br /> <br />The time was already right before 1st period in the afternoon. If I hurried I could still barely make it for start of class… cutting it extremely close.<br /> <br />As I hurriedly stood, Ms. Sakaki before me stopped me.<br /> <br />“Hold it, Amamori. You entertained my talk. I’ll turn a blind eye to your rule violation this time.”<br /> <br />At those words I felt greatly relieved.<br /> <br />After splurging big, I would have been on the verge of expulsion with a fine.<br /> <br />It’s great how it says ‘in principle’ in the rules. Wonderful.<br /> <br />I get the feeling I can get by if I suck up to Ms. Sakaki.<br /> <br />That’s what I thought, but—there might be students who don’t think that way.<br /> <br />For instance… Yeah. Strong sense of justice-type heroes?<br /> <br />“Now then, time we headed to class. It would reflect poorly on me as the teacher to be 5 or 10 minutes late. I’d probably get verbally defeated by the likes of Asahina.”<br /> <br />“As if you’d get defeated, Teacher.”<br /> <br />I can’t even imagine her getting logically refuted.<br /> <br />Exchanging such banter, the two of us headed to the classroom.<br /> <br />Class had already begun in the surrounding rooms, and as we passed Class 1-A and 1-B, I could feel curious gazes stabbing at us from inside the classes.<br /> <br />Ugh, feels like we stand out…<br /> <br />As I thought that while peeking into Class A and B… one student caught my eye. Blindingly bright hair, eyes like the purest gemstones. It felt as if only the area around her existed in a separate space, with such unsullied air floating around the girl.<br /> <br />…Maybe I’m mistaken? She looked kinda familiar but for now I’ll pretend I didn’t see her.<br /> <br />“Well, hope I’m not scolded for being late.”</p>

<p>Before I realized, we had arrived at Class C. …It was already over 10 minutes past the start of class.<br /> <br />She smilingly opened the door, and gazes collectively stabbed at us.<br /> <br />A bit surprised by the looks like what’re you bastards doing coming late, but my face probably looks the same since I’m expressionless, I figured indifferently. The inconvenience of being expressionless.<br /> <br />“Now then, though late, let’s start class. Amamori, take your seat.”<br /> <br />“Yes…”<br /> <br />Obediently replying, I sat as she opened the textbook.<br /> <br />5th period today was math. I was scared I’d have PTSD of her giving me incomprehensible questions like before, but if that happened, Asahina or someone would probably help me again.<br /> <br />That’s what I was thinking—when at that moment.<br /> <br />“Teacher, I have a question, if I may?”<br /> <br />The one who spoke sharply was my neighbor, Asahina Kasumi. Raising her hand primly in picture-perfect posture, seeing her, Ms. Sakaki’s smile deepened and she nodded.<br /> <br />“Ah, I was the one who was late. If hearing one question settles your discontent, I don’t mind.”<br /> <br />She’s looking down on me no matter what, huh. Is she incapable of kinder wording? As I thought that, Asahina opened her mouth.<br /> <br />“Amamori-kun didn’t make it to class in time just now, but was he penalized for violating school rules?”<br /> <br />The instant I heard those words, I realized.<br /> <br />Asahina had noticed the loophole in the rules. A question asked after noticing… no, confirmation.<br /> <br />Ms. Sakaki had an amused smile and gave a blunt answer to Asahina’s question.<br /> <br />“He ‘didn’t’ receive one. It would be wrong for a teacher who caused the rule violation to then push responsibility onto the student. A truly simple, easy answer, Asahina Kasumi.”<br /> <br />Asahina did not falter at Ms. Sakaki’s words. The flame of unshakable justice still burned in her eyes, and Ms. Sakaki also didn’t drop her smile even while directly receiving that gaze.<br /> <br />The two glared at each other for a few seconds.<br /> <br />Then amidst the painfully deep silence, Asahina struck the heart of the issue.<br /> <br />“So… the teacher’s word takes priority over the rules. In other words, am I correct?”<br /> <br />Murmurs rose in the class.<br /> <br />Asahina’s quick-witted too. Until now her thoughts must have been occupied with Kirido and me but… With this incident, she had finally arrived at that problematic point.<br /> <br />“I-In other words…?”<br /> <br />“What’re you two saying…”<br /> <br />“What do you mean, Asahina-san…?”<br /> <br />The majority of the class was confused, unable to follow the conversation. But looking around the class, some had difficult expressions. They had probably already realized what Asahina was trying to say.<br /> <br />That was probably—<br /> <br />“I’ll ask concisely. No matter how much we follow the rules, if a teacher says ‘expel’, at that point we would be expelled, correct? Is that possible?”<br /> <br />“Obviously, but what of it?”<br /> <br />Not just the question but the answer was also shocking.<br /> <br />For students completely unaware, it was like a bolt from the blue or out of left field. I’m just randomly using words that seem to fit so not sure if they make sense, but anyway, I imagine they were quite surprised.<br /> <br />“W-Wait a sec!”<br /> <br />The first to speak was, as always when saying something Kim*tae-like, Kirido.<br /> <br />“T-That’s messed up! The hell, we get expelled just cause a teacher said so! What’re you thinking, are your heads screwed on wrong!?”<br /> <br />“Oh? Can I take that as disparaging the academy, Kirido? I get the feeling I’d be allowed to discretionarily expel you this time.”<br /> <br />“Kh… Don’t mess with me!”<br /> <br />And Kirido was forcibly silenced by Ms. Sakaki.<br /> <br />Teacher, Kirido has so little time left to live, so go easy on him please.<br /> <br />“Isn’t that… abuse of authority?”<br /> <br />“What are you saying, Asahina? This is a rule officially recognized by the Headmaster himself. It should have been in the student handbook too. That teachers and the academy are absolute.”<br /> <br />“…Even exceeding the school rules?”<br /> <br />“Exactly. Talking to such dimwits is tiring. If you were clever, you would have realized it when I let Amamori skip the first day, Asahina.”<br /> <br />Instigating, instigating. Ms. Sakaki, you’re really riling them up. At this point it’s like a drawn out villain speech, so I smiled wryly inside, while visible anger swelled in the provoked students.<br /> <br />“If they spout this crap, then quit this school—”<br /> <br />“And after quitting, what then?”<br /> <br />Asahina questioned Kirido’s words.<br /> <br />…There might be nothing after.<br /> <br />The rumors of past incidents, and the current state of the academy.<br /> <br />It stops the students’ momentum as the worst possibility.<br /> <br />The students who fell silent with blue faces. Among them, only Asahina kept facing forward.<br /> <br />“I cannot overlook such absurdity.”<br /> <br />“Society is made of absurdity. In the face of that, you can’t overlook it…? When you enter society and face absurdity, will you appeal directly to your boss? Complain to the company president? Honestly, kids are so troubling. If you want to dream, you can cling to your parents.”<br /> <br />Ms. Sakaki’s sneer had somehow turned into ridicule.<br /> <br />“Look, hero of justice. This is reality, a microcosm of modern society.”<br /> <br />What she said was probably logical too.<br /> <br />And what Asahina said was also logical.<br /> <br />Personally I want to ignore stuff like that and just go ‘Aren’t the rules too harsh?’ but when emotions get involved, it won’t go smoothly in a straight line.<br /> <br />“I… understand. So that is the school’s stance, correct?”<br /> <br />“Right. No matter which teacher you ask, you’ll get this kind of answer…. Though there were students in the past who charged ahead when told that and got expelled on the spot.”<br /> <br />A maximum threat from Ms. Sakaki. However, Asahina Kasumi didn’t waver, the flame of justice burning in her eyes.<br /> <br />Her figure was hope itself, a great light for the students.<br /> <br />And to the students, the academy probably looked like ‘an utterly insane evil’.<br /> <br />“….”<br /> <br />Losing interest in the flow of conversation, I turned my gaze out the window.<br /> <br />The spring sunshine was still warm, cherry blossom petals danced in the wind.<br /> <br />It was spring, when everyone is hopeful and looks ahead, yet<br /> <br />All that lingered in the classroom was a sense of despair.<br /> <br />“Now then,”<br /> <br />I muttered, inaudible to anyone.<br /> <br />Taking out my phone without Ms. Sakaki noticing, I sent a message to someone.<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />If describing the person Amamori Yuuto in one word—<br /> <br />I pondered for a bit, but the conclusion would be the single word [Liar].<br /> <br />Always clad in lies, spewing them recklessly from my mouth. All the impressions others have of me are mistaken, even I myself no longer know what the real me is.<br /> <br />Even so I strongly assert my views, clearly stating my dislikes.<br /> <br />Troublesome things. Roundabout things. And things that restrict my freedom.<br /> <br />Among those, this time I’ll discuss the waste of time.<br /> <br />The detestable problem right before my eyes I want to cover up.<br /> <br />…This late in the game I’ll state it clearly, it’s about Kirido.<br /> <br />Up to now, I kept observing him. Maybe he’d be useful somehow. Keeping him around might rein in the other classes too. That fool made me ponder all sorts of ways he could be used.<br /> <br />And in conclusion—there were none. Not a single redeeming factor.<br /> <br />In that case, I should promptly end it right?<br /> <br />“Sorry… to call you out to a place like this too.”<br /> <br />I spoke while turning around to the student standing before me.<br /> <br />If I had the power to immediately end him, hypothetically.<br /> <br />I’d surely end him the instant I could confirm his demise. The moment I was certain of his end, I’d finalize it.<br /> <br />…Otherwise it’d just be entertainment.<br /> <br />I don’t feel amusement at kicking others down, I haven’t sunk that low as a person.<br /> <br />Well, being unmoved at driving someone to hell could be said to mean I ‘have’ sunk low in a sense.<br /> <br />Anyway, it’s about time I made my move too.<br /> <br />The teacher’s twisting of the rules. Kirido’s incomprehensible conduct. The embodiment of justice, Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />Plus, there were still two others in other classes who avoided rule violations.<br /> <br />When they stood in Class C’s way as enemies, we’d have no leeway to worry about internal discord.<br /> <br />In other words, what I want to say is—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Eliminate Kirido. Lend a hand, Kurashiki.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I told the girl before me that.<br /> <br />“…………Huh?”<br /> <br />After a long silence, she let out a surprised voice.<br /> <br />Her eyes were opened wide as if seeing something unbelievable, and her mouth repeatedly opened and closed.<br /> <br />After school. I’d messaged Kurashiki and called her out to an unused classroom.<br /> <br />Of course, no beating around the bush as usual. I got straight to the main issue.<br /> <br />“W-What are you suddenly saying…”<br /> <br />“That’s enough of the pointless acting.”<br /> <br />I cut in sharply, and her face tensed just slightly, by a hair’s breadth.<br /> <br />Kurashiki Hotaru. The class representative. A bright, energetic moodmaker.<br /> <br />She prioritizes others over herself, scattering kindness without discrimination. Yet she was fairer than anyone, taking the lead in speaking to teachers; she was truly suited to be the ‘class representative’.<br /> <br />Of course I’d been saved by that kindness too, and her always nursing me when I got punched repeatedly did seem the conduct of a wonderful virtuous person.<br /> <br />However.<br /> <br />“Your ‘perfection’ is slightly too much. To me it reeks of lies.”<br /> <br />At my words, Kurashiki’s shoulders jerked.<br /> <br />The first time I noticed her existence was when I peeked into the classroom.<br /> <br />The class rep-like one. A model honor student… My first impression was like that.<br /> <br />It changed to clear interest when I divulged my esper power.<br /> <br />At that time, there were only five I could confirm who didn’t laugh after hearing my power.<br /> <br />One was Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />The second and third were male students who, same as me, kept straight faces.<br /> <br />The fourth was a female student who had been vigilantly eyeing me the whole time.<br /> <br />And the last one was—<br /> <br />“Why didn’t you laugh at my power?”<br /> <br />Yes, this person, ‘Kurashiki Hotaru’.<br /> <br />As if thinking up an excuse, she opened her mouth with the perfect smiling mask.<br /> <br />But sorry. I don’t plan to continue some tedious Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>“When Ms. Sakaki told you to reveal your real or fake power, you were hesitating if I remember right. No honor student should hesitate at a scene like that.”<br /> <br />“You’re… really observant, huh.”<br /> <br />Somehow Kurashiki managed a reply.<br /> <br />Her shoulders trembled slightly, but it probably wasn’t from fear of me.<br /> <br />“You pondered it. The lie you were considering revealing. The ‘lie’ you were threatened by the teacher it’d be found out and you’d lose credibility if you revealed. Yet you went and blatantly revealed that right from the start.”<br /> <br />A fool would laugh. Look down on it with scorn.<br /> <br />But the wise would doubt, doubt first that it was a lie.<br /> <br />Well, our Asahina went with justice in her heart or whatever before doubting, and I can’t judge if the three expressionless ones are fools or wise, but—this one was extremely clear.<br /> <br />“—You doubted, didn’t you?”<br /> <br />That’s right, she doubted.<br /> <br />The ‘lie’ I had been considering.<br /> <br />The ‘lie’ that I was threatened not to use by the teacher, warning me that it was not a wise move and that it would cost me trust if I got caught.<br /> <br />Without hesitation, I decided to reveal it from the very beginning.<br /> <br />Well, whether my ability is real or fake, she probably questioned my sanity, along with my ability. That’s why she didn’t have time to laugh. She couldn’t afford to in the atmosphere that surrounded us.<br /> <br />“The climax was when you lingered in the infirmary. No matter how perfect a class president you are, you wouldn’t risk staying there until the end, not even with the risk of a fine. Kurashiki Hotaru, you really went overboard with that.”<br /> <br />It might become a fine. Given that choice after being told that, it would only apply to someone who has something more important than the risk of a fine on their mind. In your case, it’s determining who I am, right?<br /> <br />In the battle with Kirido, I lost without even having the chance to activate my ability. Or rather, I had no intention of showing it. That’s why this woman couldn’t be sure. She couldn’t confirm if my ability was real or not.<br /> <br />That’s why she tried to make sure.<br /> <br />Whether I’m a thoughtless idiot or something else entirely.<br /> <br />…So, Kurashiki, have you decided to have a serious conversation with me yet?<br /> <br />I look at Kurashiki.<br /> <br />Under my stern gaze.<br /> <br />Kurashiki, who had been taken aback.<br /> <br />Right after that.<br /> <br />She suddenly broke into laughter.<br /> <br />“Ahahaha!”<br /> <br />…Laughter.<br /> <br />It was as if she had gone mad.<br /> <br />High-pitched, eerie, and unsettling.<br /> <br />Her voice had the opposite qualities of being likable.<br /> <br />She was laughing.<br /> <br />Holding her stomach.<br /> <br />Wiping the tears that had gathered at the edges of her eyes.<br /> <br />But immediately after that.<br /> <br />Her smile disappeared completely, and an expressionless Kurashiki Hotaru stood there.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“You really are something else, Amamori-Kkn.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Her appearance looked like a ghost to me.<br /> <br />As if something precious had completely slipped away from her soul…<br /> <br />Because I had seen the usual Kurashiki Hotaru. What I saw now was surreal and dreamlike.<br /> <br />But her footsteps reminded me, “This is reality.”<br /> <br />She turned around and began walking towards the door.<br /> <br />There was no usual energy in her back.<br /> <br />I gazed at her back like that, and in the next moment, I was awakened by the sound of the door locking.<br /> <br />“In an empty classroom, just the two of us.”<br /> <br />If you hear just that, doesn’t it sound quite youthful?<br /> <br />But the eyes that looked back at me were icy and clear, completely different from the ‘class president’ from earlier.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Well, there’s no need to hide anymore, Yuuto Amamori.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Just to be clear, the one who said this manly line was undoubtedly the girl right in front of me, ‘Kurashiki Hotaru.’<br /> <br />She let down her tied-up hair.<br /> <br />Her orange hair fell down.<br /> <br />And her sparkling eyes, which had been shining, were now clouded like muddy water.<br /> <br />“You passed, Yuuto. I was investigating you. Somehow, you smelled like a big liar, just like me. So, what are you, exactly? How much can you do? What kind of true nature are you hiding, and what is your purpose? I was investigating all of that.”<br /> <br />Her eyes, staring at me, seemed to tremble with delight.<br /> <br />And without any hesitation, she stated,<br /> <br />“Now, your ‘ability,’ it’s a lie, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />My ability – to ‘impair vision.’<br /> <br />Well, I won’t deny it or confirm it. If you want to think it’s a lie, feel free. There doesn’t seem to be any advantage or disadvantage either way.<br /> <br />“…You’re not denying it? Well, I’ll take it the way I want to. After all, during that match, you could perfectly see Kirido’s movements, but you still got beaten up. There’s no way someone with normal nerves would hide their power like that. So, I thought, what if you’re pretending? And what if it’s just an act?”<br /> <br />“Is it a joke? I think I just lost normally.”<br /> <br />“…Stop with the pointless acting. I’ll return your words, you lying scumbag.”<br /> <br />Acting? Well, acting. I think it’s more like what you call a ‘lie’ rather than acting, but there’s no point in dwelling on that.”<br /> <br />“Whatever. I won’t ask about your power for now. No point when I can imagine you won’t say. Just answer me this at least, Amamori.”<br /> <br />Her stern voice echoed.<br /> <br />And then in an instant, her figure vanished as if erased.<br /> <br />A slight single step so fast I thought she’d really disappeared.<br /> <br />I only grasped everything after my body was slammed against the wall.<br /> <br />The shock forced all the oxygen in my lungs to backflow. Amidst voiceless screams leaking out, her eyes peering at me from point-blank range as she grabbed my collar.<br /> <br />“Just what’s your aim?”<br /> <br />My aim… The first time I’ve considered it after being asked.<br /> <br />Ms. Sakaki had asked me something similar too. What were my true intentions.<br /> <br />If I think about it, in the depths of my heart I’m extremely simple, tragically pure.<br /> <br />“To… live freely, I guess you could say?”<br /> <br />“Freedom, you say?”<br /> <br />Anger swelled from her body at my words.<br /> <br />She probably thought I was messing with her.<br /> <br />Whatever, but if you’re going to listen, I want you to hear me out to the end.<br /> <br />“I extremely hate being bound. This academy makes me want to hurl. I want to destroy the condescending teachers and academy binding me.”<br /> <br />Nonstop lies spew from my mouth. Lying as easily as breathing.<br /> <br />Or rather, to be accurate they aren’t lies, but—not my true motives and reasons either.<br /> <br />In response to my words. Looking down at me now. For the first time, her body stiffened.<br /> <br />I only ever speak lies. Continuing to walk the furthest from sincerity.<br /> <br />But even so.<br /> <br />I can’t go wrong with just the place I should aim for.<br /> <br />No matter what happens, no matter what I have to sacrifice,<br /> <br />I will surely accomplish that one goal.<br /> </p>







<p>“I want to destroy this academy, you see.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Yes, I smiled.<br /> <br />My face showed not a shred of emotion. Yet even so, it alone reflected a single one—delight.<br /> <br />A wide smile twisted by cold madness.<br /> <br />I wonder what kind of eyes I looked up at her with.<br /> <br />Looking down on me were the trembling eyes of Kurashiki, filled with fear of me.<br /> <br />“Didn’t I tell you I was dangerous? Just as I said, Asahina Kasumi has realized that at this academy, ‘teachers’ hold more power than ‘rules.’ And now, through her words and actions, the entire class – no, potentially the entire grade – will come to understand this fact. As a result, her sense of justice will ignite the class, shaking the entire academy in a coup.”<br /> <br />She has just that much charisma and latent ability.<br /> <br />Even after spitting out abusive language to incite her classmates, they still one-sidedly adore her. That alone makes it clear to even amateurs how overflowing with charisma she is.<br /> <br />And one day, she will unite the class and raise the flag of rebellion against the academy.<br /> <br />That’s no longer a future prediction that can be averted.<br /> <br />It will happen soon, although that ‘soon’ is still more than half a year away… When it happens, those who disturb the class harmony are, honestly, unnecessary in the extreme.<br /> <br />“So we prune the unnecessary. We eliminate them preemptively from behind.”<br /> <br />Furthermore, to put it bluntly—<br /> <br />“We become the [darkness] behind the [light]. We bury in darkness the unnecessary that Asahina Kasumi cannot judge.”<br /> <br />At those words, Kurashiki releases her grip on my collar.<br /> <br />Her eyes overflow with astonishment, fear, and a hint of delight.<br /> <br />The corners of her mouth naturally turn up.<br /> <br />“You’re totally warped. No doubt about it.”<br /> <br />“Oh, I know,” I replied.<br /> <br />I feel nothing at kicking others down.<br /> <br />For example, even if I ripped someone’s mind to shreds for my own purposes, leaving only their face and name, and discarded them like a filthy rag, I probably wouldn’t feel anything. No, I couldn’t feel anything.<br /> <br />It’s possible I’d even forget about it a few days later.<br /> <br />What sane person could call someone who could trample over others’ lives and then live on innocently a ‘normal’ human being?<br /> <br />“Basically, we’ll leave bringing down the academy entirely up to Asahina Kasumi. Well, if she turns out to be too useless, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, we’ll secretly get rid of that guy without involving Asahina Kasumi.”<br /> <br />What’s needed for this is a talented individual relatively close to Asahina and who has the full trust of the class. And, the one behind Asahina Kasumi… the role of ‘Yuuto Amamori’s decoy.’<br /> <br />Well, the latter will be selected from within the class later on.<br /> <br />“I get it from what you’ve said. No matter how much we try to manipulate things, Asahina Kasumi doesn’t want Kirido removed. So, she won’t get involved in this case. We’ll secretly take care of him ourselves.”<br /> <br />All the necessary conditions are in place. We understand his thinking thoroughly, and the thought manipulation has already been done.<br /> <br />So, all that’s left is to… crush him.<br /> <br />“If it’s just taking down Kirido alone, I’m more than enough on my own. However, considering what lies ahead, someone as useful as you will be necessary.”<br /> <br />Having disclosed her underlying intentions like this, the woman is determined to pull her onto our side no matter what. We can’t have her simply ankle-deep in the mud; she needs to be immersed headfirst.<br /> <br />I grip her hand and pull her closer.<br /> <br />Kurashiki, who can’t react in time. Ignoring her anxiousness, I peer into her eyes from an extremely close distance.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Kurashiki Hotaru, I need you. Lend me your strength.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Just where will this madness end up?<br /> <br />I don’t know, but for now,<br /> <br />I’ll start here and charge ahead as far as I can go.<br /> <br />—That is my mindset.</p>

<p>“You know, my goal is to make this school right,” Kurashiki says with her usual smile on our way back to the dorm.<br /> <br />After leaving the classroom where we’d held our meeting, I was walking back to the dorm with her beside me.<br /> <br />At a glance, her ‘true’ self has already withdrawn. Unlike earlier, the her now is flawlessly playing the part of Student Council President, to the point that even I can’t see through her act.<br /> <br />I was worried that after exposing her true side so easily and becoming my accomplice after just a few days here, she might not be reliable, but…it seems I was anxious over nothing. This girl had deliberately exposed parts of her true self.<br /> <br />At this point, I can’t even tell whether Kurashiki or I was the one who took the other’s bait.<br /> <br />“Right…make it right?”<br /> <br />“Yup. I want to live an easy life. I’ll make any effort to live easily. To live easily, I don’t mind pretending to be someone I’m not. I honestly believe that.”<br /> <br />So she says simply, to make it right.<br /> <br />“Because it’s annoying, isn’t it? Having classmates badmouth you, or getting oppressed by school rules on a whim. So I hide my thorny personality—Yuuto, I’ve decided to assist you in what you’re trying to do.”<br /> <br />As agreed, we formed a temporary, provisional cooperative relationship.<br /> <br />However, it too was only temporary. She had given me corresponding conditions as well.<br /> <br />“That said, this is on the assumption that Yuuto has the power to speak of ideals. I’ll say this in advance, but Yuuto—the moment you lose even once, I’ll cut you off.”<br /> <br />The meaning of ‘cut off’…well, it means she’ll abandon me.<br /> <br />It’s quite a difficult condition. I’m a small fry who would lose even to Kirido.<br /> <br />“Oh, but I’ll allow intentional losses, ‘kay? I honestly think it’d be shameful to lose to trash like that…but Yuuto is the type who gets excited by losing, right?”<br /> <br />“Please don’t lump me in with the likes of them.”<br /> <br />That line gave me goosebumps. As I rubbed my arms, I averted my gaze from her.<br /> <br />In my peripheral vision, her retied ponytail swayed.<br /> <br />However, the voice I heard was terribly cold:<br /> <br />“Luckily, your goal is fairly close to mine. Cooperating isn’t reluctant in the least….However, don’t get the wrong idea. I’m not your comrade. I’ll always be ready to betray you anytime I see you as useless.”<br /> <br />That’s great. I don’t plan anything but using and wringing her dry unilaterally either.<br /> <br />I never had any sense of camaraderie to begin with. No need for trust or bonds.<br /> <br />All we need between us is a cooperative relationship, nothing more.<br /> <br />As I gazed at the evening sky, the student council president persona Kurashiki spoke to me:<br /> <br />“So, what’s the plan from here, Yuuto? Use force?”<br /> <br />“Don’t be stupid. There’s no way I could beat Kirido in a direct confrontation.”<br /> <br />“You can say that right after I telling you I’d cut ties if you lost?”<br /> <br />Well, no matter how much you tell me that… After all, I’ve lost once already.<br /> <br />Without exaggerating, I think Kirido is strong. Despite being in a position like an attack dog in the opening of a novel, his physical abilities are top class in our grade. And in just a few days here, his skill at manipulating his abilities is impressive. If it weren’t for his personality issues…<br /> <br />“But you could win if you used your real powers, right?”<br /> <br />“…I told you, I have no ‘real’ powers or anything like that.”<br /> <br />I’m not lying about my abilities. Probably. Though this line might be a lie too.<br /> <br />Oh, right. I forgot one or two things I wanted to say.<br /> <br />As I rummaged through my pocket, I returned my gaze to Kurashiki.<br /> <br />“Come to think of it, you graffitied Kirido’s desk, right?”<br /> <br />“Huhhh? No idea what you’re talking about!”<br /> <br />Her reaction confirmed it. You jerk…because of you I got punched again!<br /> <br />When my nose bleeds it stains my uniform, you know? At least pay the cleaning bill!<br /> <br />I thought that while handing her the item I took from my pocket.<br /> <br />“Also, this is an anti-wiretapping device. Going forward, when necessary, plug it into your smartphone before calling. It’ll disable any and all wiretapping.”<br /> <br />“Huhhh, Yuuto can make stuff like that?”<br /> <br />What I handed her was an anti-wiretapping device disguised as a mobile charger.<br /> <br />Just plugging it into the power socket temporarily prevents wiretapping.<br /> <br />“You can only use the provided smartphones for contact. Of course, you should assume all communications are monitored by the academy. I’ll conduct any important talks over the phone from now on too. Won’t use email at all.”<br /> <br />“Whoa. I hadn’t planned on using sketchy phone calls or anything anyway…Oh well. Gotta make use of anything that seems handy! Thanks, Yuuto!”<br /> <br />Kurashiki says that cheerfully.<br /> <br />Hey, you. Don’t forget that you graffitied Kirido’s desk, got it?<br /> <br />Most likely, your aim was to send him at me to probe my true character. And dude, that punch hurt quite a bit! You get how much a straight punch to the face hurts?<br /> <br />Well, I nullified most of the damage in the instant of impact, so it wasn’t as bad as it looked.<br /> <br />Thinking about all that, I let out a big sigh.<br /> <br />“Sooo, what’s Yuuto’s real power anyway?”<br /> <br />“You’re persistent, Kurashiki.”<br /> <br />I scowled…or at least tried to, but I think my expression was blank.<br /> <br />Why is she so stubbornly convinced I’m lying?<br /> <br />I don’t get her reasoning at all, but even if I did have some hidden power, I probably wouldn’t use it against Kirido. The real pain is the guys who got away with not breaking school rules as the first ones in our grade.<br /> <br />One is me, Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />The other is Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />The third is unknown, but the fourth is probably…<br /> <br />“Well, no need to get involved unless necessary,”<br /> <br />I muttered, glancing at Kurashiki beside me.<br /> <br />“Kurashiki. Tomorrow at 6am, meet in the classroom from earlier.”<br /> <br />“That’s really early… Are we doing something?”<br /> <br />She looks at me curiously, and I state matter-of-factly:<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Tomorrow morning, we’ll eliminate Kirido. That’s already decided.”<br /> </p>











<p> <br />…I still dream about it sometimes.<br /> <br />I was abandoned by my mother.<br /> <br />I remember it being back in elementary school.<br /> <br />She had long black hair down to her waist, beautiful in profile as well.<br /> <br />My mother was much younger than my father, probably over 10 years between them.<br /> <br />I loved my mother, and I still dream of her beautiful back.<br /> <br />Whenever I close my eyes, the warm scenes of back then float into view.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />—I can still vividly recall the eyes of that woman who abandoned me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />5am on his fifth day at the academy, Kirido woke up.<br /> <br />Though I tried to sleep more, I just couldn’t get in the mood… Recalling the reason, I clicked my tongue in annoyance. That’s right, a guy from my class kept me from sleeping soundly.<br /> <br />“Damn…!”<br /> <br />I spit the word out briefly, sat up throwing off the futon, and kicked over the desk in my room when I saw it.<br /> <br />I was furious. Extremely so.<br /> <br />Who I was furious at was simply the individual, Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />He rubbed me the wrong way from the start.<br /> <br />Despite not being strong, instead being pathetically weak and only gifted mediocre abilities, he advertised that openly and curried favor with Asahina acting like an ally of justice.<br /> <br />…Asahina Kasumi is special. Because it’s me, I understand.<br /> <br />The other guys definitely don’t get it, but I do.<br /> <br />She’s different from the rest. That’s why I paid attention to her from the start. From the moment I saw that black hair and green eyes, that back, I decided she would be mine.<br /> <br />And that guy…<br /> <br />“Pisses me off so damn much…”<br /> <br />He laid a hand on my Asahina. At that point alone, he was worth beating to death.<br /> <br />Even though she hadn’t greeted me, hadn’t waved to me.<br /> <br />There’s someone ahead of me. That alone was reason enough for me to resort to violence.<br /> <br />I’m cunning, so I carefully devised a plan that wouldn’t raise any suspicions, and I lured that guy into the battlefield. Well, I did let my guard down a few times and took some hits, but I kept on pounding that guy as much as I wanted.<br /> <br />…But then, Asahina sided with him again.<br /> <br />Of all times, he had to catch my punches. More than the humiliation of losing to a woman, more than the irritation of getting scolded by the higher-ups… I didn’t like the fact that he was prioritized over me.<br /> <br />“Someday I’ll definitely kill that bastard…”<br /> <br />My anger at that guy overflowed inside me.<br /> <br />Kill, kill, kill, kill—For the first time in my life fighting almost every day even before entering this school, I harbored pure killing intent. I would end that guy with these hands—<br /> <br />“Oh yeah, that bastard graffitied my desk…”<br /> <br />Thinking about that guy reminded me about my desk. I had…um, swapped it with one of the mob characters’ desks. I had them read the school rules too, and there was no rule against switching desks, so it didn’t directly harm me but…I just couldn’t let Amamori get away with it unharmed. Gotta make him taste humiliation far worse than I did.<br /> <br />“Yeah…I gotta get back at his desk!”<br /> <br />Suddenly, I hit upon a great idea! That’s right, if I do the same or worse to Amamori’s desk, that’ll be perfect payback! Man, the terrible things I can think up. I’m starting to scare myself with how smart I am!<br /> <br />I immediately messaged my underlings to come to the academy right away.<br /> <br />It’s 5am, but well, they’ll see a message from me right away. Being late means a fine.<br /> <br />I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and put on my uniform before leaving my room.<br /> <br />No time like the present, as they say. I’ve gotta get back at him right now or I won’t feel satisfied. I got a sandwich for breakfast at the nearby convenience store and considered my plan again as I ate.<br /> <br />What sort of revenge should I take? Just graffiti is too naive. Oh, I know! How about I cover his desk with leftovers from the cafeteria? Now that’s a great nasty idea!<br /> <br />After spending around thirty minutes polishing my plot, I arrived at the school building a little after 6am.<br /> <br />At that time, none of my underlings were around. Maybe the bathroom or something… Either way, not coming to greet me deserves death, their deaths. Death, yeah, death—I don’t really get the nuance, but it sounds cool, right? They deserve death!<br /> <br />Vaguely thinking about that, I absentmindedly directed my gaze toward the shoe lockers.<br /> <br />And there I opened my eyes wide at the figure of someone I never imagined being there.<br /> <br />“Oh, Asahina…?”</p>

<p>And there I opened my eyes wide at the figure of someone I never imagined being there.<br /> <br />“Oh, Asahina…?”<br /> <br />By the shoe lockers was Asahina Kasumi, in the middle of changing from outdoor to indoor shoes. She still didn’t seem to have noticed me.<br /> <br />No mistake, it’s Asahina. That black hair and green eyes.<br /> <br />There’s no way I would mistake that girl…that [back] for someone else’s.<br /> <br />“Yo, Asahina! What a coincidence running into each other this early! It’s like fate!”<br /> <br />I waved my hand as I dashed over to her. On the rare day I happen to come to school early, you come early too. It really is like fate!<br /> <br />No, this is fate. It’s definitely my fate to obtain you.<br /> <br />“That’s right, Asahina!”<br /> <br />I ran up to her. To try and see her smile, I leaned in to peer at her face.<br /> <br />Before I realized it, Asahina’s figure had vanished from before me.<br /> <br />“Wha—?! Where the hell did she go?!”<br /> <br />I frantically looked around. Divine Protection of the Thunder God…isn’t that too fast?!<br /> <br />And even though I greeted her, she ignored me…or could she not have noticed me? No, it must have been that she didn’t notice. That’s for sure—<br /> <br />“Asahina!”<br /> <br />As I looked around, I noticed Asahina walking down the hallway in the distance.<br /> <br />Without even changing into my indoor shoes, I sprinted down the hallway in my outdoor shoes.<br /> <br />That’s right, Asahina, there’s no way you ignored me. You just didn’t notice me, right?<br /> <br />I caught up to her and reached out to grab her back.<br /> <br />My fingertips were about to touch her familiar black hair…<br /> <br />but once again, right before I made contact, her figure vanished.<br /> <br />“Da—, shit! Why, how—?!”<br /> <br />Clenching my outstretched hand, I ground my teeth in anger and frustration.<br /> <br />Asahina was nowhere to be seen as I looked around. My gaze naturally dropped to my feet…and I noticed a white envelope lying there.<br /> <br />Curious, I picked it up and saw the name [Asahina Kasumi] written on the back.<br /> <br />Could this be…a love letter?<br /> <br />I hastily tore open the envelope and took out the letter inside. Sure enough, the letter contained Asahina’s passionate love confession to me.<br /> <br />…What the—. So she hadn’t ignored me after all! Her unnatural behavior earlier must have been because she was embarrassed to give me this love letter.<br /> <br />As I read over the letter, I raised the corners of my lips in a grin. With something like this, I’ve got no time to worry about that Amamori bastard! I’ve gotta find Asahina right away and respond to this confession…I’ve gotta show her my power and then surely—<br /> <br />“What’s this? ‘Before homeroom, on the third floor, in the farthest unused classroom, waiting for you’… is that it? Hah, just you wait, Asahina, I’m heading there right now!”<br /> <br />I’m sure I had a creepy smile on my face. That’s how ecstatic I was.<br /> <br />Asahina liked me after all. I’m the one, I’m the one who’s prioritized above anyone else.<br /> <br />No matter what school, what place I go to, in the end, I’m the king.<br /> <br />So…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[“I’ll be waiting for you. To my dearest, Yuuto Amamori.”]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Looking at that sentence written at the end of the note, I realized that my vision was turning crimson.<br /> <br />My brain desperately tried to reject understanding the meaning.<br /> <br />But my body was honest; gripped by anger, I crumpled the note and threw it away.<br /> <br />Before even thinking, I kicked the hallway and started running.<br /> <br />“I’m gonna… kill him!”<br /> <br />I cast away reason, and from the depths of my instincts, a powerful intent to kill welled up.<br /> <br />I understood. The moment I laid eyes on Yuuto Amamori again, it would be his end.<br /> <br />I will kill Amamori. That’s a certainty. Punch him, kick him, and then punch him again, crush him.<br /> <br />I have to do that much, or this anger won’t be appeased.<br /> <br />I reached the staircase leading upstairs. I still couldn’t see Asahina.<br /> <br />Did he head to the empty classroom, take a detour… it didn’t matter.<br /> <br />Fortunately, I knew where Amamori would be coming. So, I’ll go at Mach speed, beat Amamori to a pulp, show Asahina his pathetic corpse… show my power, and then, surely…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘Ah, Yuuto-kun, I… I really loved you, after all.’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I heard hallucinations in my head. Why is this voice… no, why is Asahina making such a voice!<br /> <br />Even in my imagination, I’m the only one who should hear such a sweet voice!<br /> <br />I shout that, but the hallucinations never stop.<br /> <br />[‘—Yes, I love you too, Yuuto-kun.’]<br /> <br />[‘I fell in love at first sight. Completely smitten.’]<br /> <br />[‘Eh, Kirido, Run? Who was that?’]<br /> <br />[‘That’s what his name was. To be honest… I almost forgot because I have no interest.’]<br /> <br />[‘He’s extremely annoying, isn’t he? That guy, does he really think he’s liked?’]<br /> <br />The disgusting hallucinations won’t stop.<br /> <br />It’s like, voices whispering in my ear as if some kind of ability is activated.<br /> <br />In Asahina’s voice… in Asahina’s voice…<br /> <br />[‘—I really hate you. I don’t even want to see your face.’]<br /> <br />That voice.<br /> <br />It overlapped with my mother’s voice from back then in my head.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />[I hate you. I don’t even want to see your face]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That voice<br /> <br />overlapped with my mother’s voice in my mind.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Amamori aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa—!!”<br /> <br />I screamed. I couldn’t think about anything else now.<br /> <br />My mind was blank. Aside from the intent to kill him, there was nothing else. I couldn’t think anymore.<br /> <br />I started running. I used my Ability [Momentum Burst] at full power to blast off.<br /> <br />The location was the farthest room on the third floor.<br /> <br />That’s where…he was. That Amamori bastard was waiting.<br /> <br />“Kyaa—?!”<br /> <br />I heard a shriek as I sprinted down the hallway.<br /> <br />A sharp pain remained in my arm but I didn’t care.<br /> <br />I could also hear unknown screams and pained groans from behind.<br /> <br />But whatever, I didn’t care…!<br /> <br />“Ame—miya—!”<br /> <br />I could already see my destination. The farthest room on the third floor.<br /> <br />In my line of sight—Asahina was just entering the classroom.<br /> <br />On her face was an unclouded joy. A maiden’s expression before meeting her beloved.<br /> <br />That smile, a smile she’d never shown me, made me—!<br /> <br />“Asahina—! Damn you—!”<br /> <br />I screamed with all my might. But Asahina didn’t so much as glance my way.<br /> <br />She should be able to hear my voice! Why wasn’t she looking my way, why?!<br /> <br />—…Why was she looking at me like that.<br /> <br />A past memory crossed my mind.<br /> <br />Me trying to punch Amamori, my fist stopped right before impact. Amamori looking at me expressionlessly as he stopped it.<br /> <br />—And Asahina, sending her cold gaze at me.<br /> <br />It was a gaze like those of just allies looking at ‘evil’…the worst gaze.<br /> <br />Recalling that Asahina, that time, I let out a scream with all my might.<br /> <br />Look at me, just me! Asahina, look only at me!<br /> <br />Don’t look at me with a gaze like that. A gentle gaze like you do at Amamori.<br /> <br />Look only at me…!<br /> <br />“Damn you—!”<br /> <br />Asahina’s figure disappeared as soon as she entered the classroom.<br /> <br />I arrived at the classroom door right after her.<br /> <br />Chasing after Asahina’s retreating back, I kicked down the door and barged into the room—<br /> <br />And my eyes opened as wide as they could go.<br /> <br />“Oh, the guest I expected has arrived.”<br /> <br />Inside was Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />He was sitting atop a desk looking down on me, and next to him was…why was Kurashiki Hotaru here too? But Asahina, who I’d just seen enter the classroom, was nowhere.<br /> <br />“Wha…what is…”<br /> <br />The words I squeezed out.<br /> <br />Hearing them, Amamori Yuuto laughed loudly.<br /> <br />The expressionless guy showed an expression for the first time. …That smile was eerily distorted, giving off a brutally insane feeling. It made my spine run cold with how—ruinous it was.<br /> <br />“—Kirido. I will eliminate you.”<br /> <br />Those words were definitely not from the ‘Amamori Yuuto’ I knew.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />That place was the empty classroom I had used to meet with Kurashiki before.<br /> <br />The room’s curtains were tightly shut, and the interior was filled with darkness.<br /> <br />The small lanterns scattered around the classroom were the only light source, and thanks to Kirido kicking down the door, it had gotten considerably brighter.<br /> <br />As I spun my thoughts while sitting atop a desk, I told Kirido before me:<br /> <br />“—Kirido, I will eliminate you.”<br /> <br />I stood up from the desk I’d been sitting on.<br /> <br />Kirido, who had unilaterally slaughtered me before…had he been overwhelmed by the atmosphere? For some reason he seemed afraid of me, visibly shaking.<br /> <br />“Wha…what the hell…you…!”<br /> <br />“Can I take that as your will? I’m short on time and want to finish you off soon.”<br /> <br />I cut him off sharply as he began shouting.<br /> <br />It was 6:30am. Even though it was early, some students may have already started arriving at school. I definitely didn’t want anyone seeing me crushing Kirido.<br /> <br />“You…Amamori!”<br /> <br />Kirido glared at me in what seemed like rage…but his feet didn’t step forward from where they were. Overwhelmed by the atmosphere, gripped by fear, the current Kirido was like nothing more than a frightened puppy.<br /> <br />Tormenting such a puppy is mentally unsanitary, so let’s wrap this up quickly.<br /> <br />“Hey, hey, Yuuto! Kirido looks scared, but there’s really no need to bother with him right? It’s obvious at a glance he’ll disappear on his own soon enough, right?”<br /> <br />With a broad grin, Kurashiki taunted him.<br /> <br />“Ku, Kura…shiki…? You too, what are you—?!”<br /> <br />A small shriek escaped Kirido’s throat at Kurashiki’s words.<br /> <br />But all that came in return was a click of the tongue.<br /> <br />—And then, Kurashiki’s body suddenly accelerated.<br /> <br />“Don’t you dare call me by name, vermin. It taints my image.”<br /> <br />The next voice came from behind Kirido.</p>

<p>When Kirido turned around in shock, she was there carrying the broken door in one hand.<br /> <br />…There’s no way someone of her slim build could exert that kind of force. Her astounding mobility and strength to lift the door one-handed, her Ability was doubtless physical enhancement.<br /> <br />Kirido seemed dumbfounded as he watched Kurashiki use the broken door to block the entrance.<br /> <br />“Sakaki said it on the first day. Abilities have a ‘hierarchy’.”<br /> <br />If I recall correctly, that was something the outer Kurashiki told me about. Fourth-rank ‘Nothing’, third-rank ‘King’, second-rank ‘Divine Protection’, and the phantom first-rank ‘Sequence’ that only appeared at astronomical probabilities.<br /> <br />“There’s one problem. What do you think my Ability is? Mr. Fourth-Rank.”<br /> <br />“A King Skill I guess? Clearly a cut above the rest.”<br /> <br />“I won’t hear that from fake bottom-rank trash like you. Shut up. Are you looking down on me?”<br /> <br />Since she called me fourth-rank, I took a guess, but it seems I was wrong.<br /> <br />Kirido’s face was blue as he shook, and Kurashiki’s unbelievable about-face, along with being told ‘You’re looking down on me thinking I just have a King Skill’ seemed to give him an awful premonition.<br /> <br />“Se…second-rank—’Divine Protection’.”<br /> <br />At those words, I clearly saw Kurashiki raise the corners of her lips.<br /> <br />Divine Protection, in other words on the same level as Asahina Kasumi…amazing, I might not be able to win.<br /> <br />While absentmindedly thinking that, I returned my gaze to Kirido.<br /> <br />Kurashiki’s ‘Resistance is futile’ demonstration should be about wrapped up.<br /> <br />“—Now then, let’s get to the main issue.”<br /> <br />The real reason I called Kirido here.<br /> <br />For some inexplicable reason, he had a face like he’d seen an illusion of Lady Asahina, but I’ll write off his warped vision as an issue with his eyes, and the auditory hallucinations can be dismissed with ‘Go to an ENT’. However—hey Kirido, I can’t overlook everything else scot-free.<br /> <br />“Let me tell you the premise. I didn’t mind if you and Asahina became a couple, and if it raised her motivation I planned to cheer you on. If tranquility waited beyond that, it would have been fine. So no matter how terrible you were, I observed silently for at least these past few days.”<br /> <br />There was a chance it was my misunderstanding, that I just lacked insight.<br /> <br />Are you fit to be by Asahina’s side? Are you a person who could benefit this class going forward…I watched and listened to you closely.<br /> <br />“Conclusion—you are unnecessary. So I will crush you. I eliminate waste from my vision.”<br /> <br />“Heh…quit messing around…! Just who the hell do you think you are?!”<br /> <br />Who I think I am, huh. It would be nice if I had the sense to arrogantly say ‘Me’ here, but with my expressionless face, saying stuff like that would just be lame. And in the first place, the pronoun is different so I can’t use it.<br /> <br />But well, who I think I am doesn’t really matter.<br /> <br />Right, it doesn’t matter. I’m crushing you because you’re an annoyance.<br /> <br />I’m trampling your life because I feel like it.<br /> <br />“It’s no different from what you’re doing, after all.”<br /> <br />You and I, we’re doing the same thing.<br /> <br />That’s why no matter what you did to me, I wasn’t angry. It would be strange as a human to dislike having done to you what you do to others.<br /> <br />That’s why—hey Kirido, don’t say it’s unjust.<br /> <br />You and I are essentially the same, comrades.<br /> <br />“So don’t complain when it ends here, Kirido Hashiru.”<br /> <br />A large image was projected onto the blackboard at the front of the classroom.<br /> <br />Squinting at the burst of light, Kirido turned his gaze toward the image.<br /> <br />—I’ll say his expression then was truly a sight to behold.<br /> <br />[Heh, I can just imagine Amamori dragging his feet to school…]<br /> <br />What was projected was none other than Kirido himself. The location was this school building’s entrance. The time was early morning when the sun had just risen. In the dim lighting, he was cramming large amounts of drawing pins into someone’s indoor shoes.<br /> <br />Seeing it like this, it really makes you look like an idiot.<br /> <br />I vaguely thought that as the scene transitioned to the next.<br /> <br />It was a photograph of Kirido with a disturbing grin, carving cuts into a desk with an x-acto knife.<br /> <br />The impact seemed greater than before, as Kirido cried out in shock.<br /> <br />“Wha—?! Don’t mess around…! There’s no way…I didn’t do this!”<br /> <br />“Now now, calm down Kirido. Please watch through to the end first.”<br /> <br />At the same time I snapped my fingers, what was shown next was—a photo of Kirido rummaging through leftover food in the cafeteria’s trash, and a photo of him dumping it on a desk. The two images were split left and right. They gave off the impression of candid shots taken by a smartphone. Anyone who saw them would be convinced of his crimes—except.<br /> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/00021.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>




<p> <br />“Stop messing around! There’s no way I did this stuff! Really!” His agitation was beyond the norm.<br /> <br />Even an amateur could tell, he wasn’t lying.<br /> <br />That’s right, this is scenery you were planning to create in the future.<br /> <br />There’s no way these photos could have been taken at this point in the timeline… However, Kirido.<br /> <br />“Strangely, the photographs remain,” I muttered, showing him the camera and surveillance camera I had placed on a desk.<br /> <br />These were purchased privately by me and Kurashiki yesterday after school at an electronics shop. They were reasonably pricey, but I think I managed to buy some guaranteed quality items.<br /> <br />“You bas—!”<br /> <br />Kirido yelled—and in the next instant, his figure accelerated.<br /> <br />The two devices disappeared from my hands. Looking back, Kirido was there smashing the cameras onto the ground, stomping them into dust.<br /> <br />“Like hell…I’ll let this slide!”<br /> <br />“Sadly, reality can be cruel. It really exists, Kirido.”<br /> <br />As I said that, I operated my smartphone.<br /> <br />[I’ll kill him, I’ll definitely kill him!]<br /> <br />It played back the violent words I’d heard from Kirido before. Kirido, startled, looked back, then as he grasped the situation, his face flushed red. What filled his eyes was intense hatred.<br /> <br />“You bas—!”<br /> <br />“Sadly, this doesn’t violate school rules. However, if I say I was punched by you alongside this recording and that I ‘definitely can’t let this slide’… Oh Kirido, I’m worried about you. I’m terrified you’ll end up expelled.”<br /> <br />When I taunted him in a flat voice, a clear vein bulged on Kirido’s forehead.<br /> <br />There was a hard thud from somewhere.<br /> <br />—In the next instant, Kirido’s figure sharply and quickly charged at me.<br /> <br />It seemed his limiter had come off from his outburst, allowing full acceleration.<br /> <br />In terms of speed alone he could compete with Kurashiki who had a Divine Protection Ability—but.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“Didn’t I tell you I was eliminating you…through normal means.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Right after, Kirido had collapsed before me.<br /> <br />He fell down not understanding what had happened, and seeing that, Kurashiki, who had been silent until now, let out a long whistle. Looking that way, cold sweat was streaming down her cheek.<br /> <br />“…Yuuto, just now, were you as fast as…no, faster than Asahina?”<br /> <br />“Well, I don’t feel like comparing.”<br /> <br />Since it was a foolish question I answered ambiguously without thinking.<br /> <br />Asahina Kasumi’s [Divine Protection of the Thunder God]. I don’t know how I could surpass Divine Protection with an Ability that [Ruins Eyes], but if Kurashiki says so, it may be true.<br /> <br />“Hey, you’re lying about your Ability right?!”<br /> <br />“Hm? Don’t worry Kirido, I won’t use my power on the likes of you.”<br /> <br />Even if I did have some hidden power. No matter what ability I had.<br /> <br />Come on, I couldn’t use it against you. After all, my opponent is Kirido.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“That just now was pure physical ability. Using my Ability too would just be cruel, don’t you think?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I smiled at him with utmost goodwill. Though expressionlessly.<br /> <br />In contrast, Kirido’s face was deep blue, and Kurashiki was grinning hard enough to distort her cheeks.<br /> <br />Seeing their reactions, I looked down on Kirido.<br /> <br />“I won’t retaliate against you. You’ll disappear from this academy unharmed.”<br /> <br />I nodded slightly at Kurashiki. Then, though with a somewhat unpleasant expression, she came over to me and—slammed her fist into my face.<br /> <br />“…!”<br /> <br />Her blow with a completely different weight from Kirido’s fists.<br /> <br />It vigorously blew my body all the way to the window, the sound of shattering glass echoing through the classroom…no, the whole school. I barely managed to catch the window frame to avoid falling, then deliberately spat out the blood filling my mouth onto my uniform’s chest. I signaled Kurashiki with my chin.<br /> <br />Then, as if it were a hassle, she took out a mop from the lockers. And using her knee, she snapped the mop’s handle in two with a satisfyingly crisp sound. Still not understanding the insane situation, Kirido stared blankly as the ringing sound echoed through the classroom.<br /> <br />“Here, Kirido-kun, this is for you.”<br /> <br />What the student council president persona Kurashiki handed Kirido was one half of the snapped mop.<br /> <br />Kirido blankly looked down at the mop half he’d reflexively accepted.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Kurashiki vigorously smashed the remaining mop down on her own head.<br /> <br />“Ugh—?!”<br /> <br />…That looked painful. Though I thought that indifferently, as if watching someone else’s matter.<br /> </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/00004.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Blood was streaming from Kurashiki’s forehead. Me, punched by an ally, and Kurashiki, punching herself. Given the unbelievable situation, Kirido stood up holding the mop half in one hand.<br /> <br />“Hey, just what the hell have you guys been doing since earlier?! What exactly are you trying to—”<br /> <br />” ‘Fifth clause: Violence against students and teachers is prohibited. Students who break this clause must pay a fine or face suspension or expulsion depending on severity, unless forgiven by the victim.’<br /> <br />‘Sixth clause: Destruction of others’ belongings is prohibited. Unless forgiven by the victim, students who break this clause must pay full compensation for all damaged items and a 100,000 yen fine, or face suspension or expulsion.’<br /> <br />‘Seventh clause: Using others’ belongings without permission is prohibited. In principle, those who use or take others’ belongings without the owner’s consent must pay a 100,000 yen fine or face suspension or expulsion.'”<br /> <br />I recited the school rules over him.<br /> <br />Hurried footsteps could be heard coming from outside the classroom.<br /> <br />They came all the way to our classroom, then kicked down the broken door and appeared.<br /> <br />“Amamori! To think you suddenly borrowed an empty classroom, just what are you doing—?!”<br /> <br />…At this academy, teachers are absolute.<br /> <br />If a teacher says it’s allowed, then it’s allowed.<br /> <br />If a teacher says ‘You can borrow a classroom,’ then it’s possible.<br /> <br />Even if it means losing 300,000 yen over the course of a year.<br /> <br />In the early stages of having nearly 500,000 yen, none other than Teacher saying it’s ‘possible’ means one empty classroom can definitely be borrowed.<br /> <br />“…Kirido, what are you doing.”<br /> <br />Teacher Sakaki’s voice was endlessly cold.<br /> <br />Behind her was…unexpected. Staring at us with eyes wide in shock—the black-haired girl, Asahina Kasumi. Seeing that, Kirido raised a twisted grin.<br /> <br />“Hey, listen to me, both of you! These guys are weird! They had photos of stuff I never did, suddenly started hitting each other… And their way of talking is totally different from usual! Yeah, they’re pretending to be someone else! So in order to frame me, these guys—!”<br /> <br />“—Quiet down a bit, Kirido.”<br /> <br />Teacher Sakaki’s voice remained cold.<br /> <br />The video from Kurashiki’s smartphone was still being projected on the blackboard.<br /> <br />Glancing at it and assessing the situation, Teacher Sakaki opened her eyes thinly and smiled wryly at me, then walked over to Kurashiki and gently touched her forehead.<br /> <br />“The current situation is clear without needing your excuses. In short, you were rebuked after being caught red-handed in your crimes, but instead you became enraged, resulting in the current situation. That’s not mistaken, is it Kirido.”<br /> <br />“Wha—?! Don’t mess with me, Sakaki! No matter how you look at it, this is—!”<br /> <br />“It looks like you beat Amamori and when Kurashiki tried to help, you hit her with the mop. That’s how it appears.”<br /> <br />At those words, Kirido froze without a voice.<br /> <br />Of course, our side’s situation of in-fighting and self-harm had been brought about.<br /> <br />But even so, Kirido’s tight grip on the mop half, his usual conduct, and the potential crime photos and videos of him emphasized Kirido Hashiru’s ‘evil nature’.<br /> <br />Even if that ‘evil’ had been fabricated.<br /> <br />“Ah, Asahina! You, you’ll believe me right?! I belong to you! Hey Asahina, you…you’re the only one who understands me—!”<br /> <br />“…What are you saying?”<br /> <br />Asahina’s shoulders shook as she muttered briefly.<br /> <br />Along with yellow lightning, she dashed to stand before me.<br /> <br />Hesitantly reaching out to touch my cheek, regret swam in her eyes.<br /> <br />“…I’m sorry. Even though I promised to save you. Even though I swore to protect you…When you needed me most, I couldn’t even be there—!”<br /> <br />An intense grinding sound.<br /> <br />I saw Asahina clenching her teeth in front of me, rather than Kirido as I’d thought.<br /> <br />“No way…right? Hey, Asahina! Why are you by Amamori’s side! You, you belong to me, me alone—!”<br /> <br />“—Have shame, Kirido Hashiru.”<br /> <br />The sharp voice that rang out was Asahina’s.<br /> <br />It burned with anger. Much sharper and colder than when I first met her, yet rumbling with fiery rage—strong words.<br /> <br />Unlike the anger directed at the whole class before, this time her emotions were focused entirely on Kirido as an individual.<br /> <br />Even if his body was unharmed. Even if he felt no pain.<br /> <br />The blade of words from someone he adored accurately pierced Kirido’s heart.<br /> <br />“Even though he only wished to live in peace, you insulted him countless times, and even raised your hand against Kurashiki-san who had no involvement… How despicable, how evil… I’m ashamed I ever thought there could be reconciliation with you.”<br /> <br />Right now in this moment, the one standing there wasn’t some ally of justice.<br /> <br />She was just an ordinary high school first-year, the girl Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />That’s why it resonated.<br /> <br />Now that she had fallen from a heroine to just a girl and boy.<br /> <br />Being clearly rejected by the one he admired was surely most painful for Kirido.<br /> <br />“Hey Kirido-kun…this is the first time I’ve said this line to someone else.”<br /> <br />“Asahi—!”</p>







<p><br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“I hate you. I don’t want to see your face ever again.”<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It sounded like his heart was breaking. …Kirido crumpled to his knees.<br /> <br />His eyes were empty, containing not a shred of light.<br /> <br />Only nothingness spread, and Teacher Sakaki’s voice rose toward that Kirido.<br /> <br />“Kirido. I recognize your violations of school rules and will punish you. The relevant clauses are the fifth, sixth, and seventh clauses of the school rules. The violations are violence against a student, along with destruction of a student’s belongings, and unauthorized use of academy possessions borrowed by a student. The destruction of the academy’s possessions borrowed by a student will be treated as a ‘duplicate violation,’ necessarily doubling your punishment.”<br /> <br />And thus, Kirido Hashiru’s end arrived.<br /> <br />Property damage in the classroom x 11. Plus theft of belongings x 3. Violent acts x 2.<br /> <br />“From the extent of the injuries and the current situation, I will decide your fine for the fifth clause, violence, based on my personal discretion. Your fine for violence against Amamori Yuuto will be 200,000 yen. And your fine for violence against Kurashiki Hotaru will be 400,000 yen.”<br /> <br />The difference was likely because one victim was male and one female.<br /> <br />A boy getting some facial injuries isn’t a big issue.<br /> <br />But for a girl, it’s different. Her face getting injured is no joke.<br /> <br />So it was an acceptable decision.<br /> <br />In addition to compensation for the many damaged items, the fines for theft and violence were added.<br /> <br />…Yeah. I feel like this might be going overboard, but well, all’s well that ends well.<br /> <br />[Kirido Hashiru violated school rules clauses 5, 6, and 7. As punishment, 236,612 yen will be deducted from your account… Error. Insufficient funds confirmed. Therefore, in accordance with clause 1 of the school rules—]<br /> <br />The information sounded from his smartphone as I recalled clause 1.<br /> <br />[First clause: All of the following school rules are absolute principles during academy life. Those who violate the rules and are unable to pay the fine will be uniformly expelled.]<br /> <br />It was a sentence that couldn’t be appealed no matter how you struggled.<br /> <br />But because of that, it brought relief.<br /> <br />I deeply exhaled and closed my eyes.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Kirido Hashiru is expelled.]<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Those were absolute words that surpassed even god within the academy.<br /> <br />Refreshing wind flowed in through the broken window glass.<br /> <br />It was spring. A season for filling your chest with anticipation and celebrating your new start.<br /> <br />Cherry blossom petals danced in the wind, falling onto my head.<br /> <br />My heart was as clear as the spring sunshine.<br /> <br />—In stark contrast to the classroom air.</p>

<p>Kirido Hashiru’s expulsion.<br /> <br />The first incident since the academy life began, centering on that student.<br /> <br />Well, it wasn’t big enough to be called an ‘incident,’ but this is its modest follow-up.<br /> <br />Kirido Hashiru was expelled.<br /> <br />That fact seemed to spread through the academy in an instant, and its victims, me and the girl sitting beside me—Kurashiki Hotaru, naturally became the talk of the school, so to speak.<br /> <br />It was gym class the day after Kirido was expelled. Pressing an ice pack to my cheek, Kurashiki with her head bandaged, the two of us exempted from participation due to ‘observation’ after our injuries from the other day, sat side by side silently watching our classmates’ combat training.<br /> <br />“So in the end, what really was Yuuto-kun’s Ability?”<br /> <br />“[Eyesight Ruiner] like I said.”<br /> <br />I gave the same answer to the same question I didn’t even know how many times this was.<br /> <br />“I’m sick of that obvious lie! Like Kirido-kun said right? He saw Asahina-san enter the empty classroom. Heard Asahina-san’s auditory hallucinations. Amamori is definitely hiding his real Ability!”<br /> <br />“The ravings of a madman. Seriously listening will rot your ears, Madam President.”<br /> <br />I told her, but the President’s expression was less than pleased.<br /> <br />“To be honest, I still don’t really get it… Especially those photos and videos framing Kirido-kun. I wasn’t involved at all. If Kirido-kun didn’t know either, that means you, Amamori-kun, disguised yourself and took them alone… But those photos, there’s no way a single person could take them at those angles like that.”<br /> <br />She peered into my eyes. While her tone was that of the fair student council president, the gaze with which she looked at me was as sharp as a bird of prey’s.<br /> <br />“Say, Amamori-kun, are you collaborating with Asahina-san behind the scenes?”<br /> <br />As she said that, she turned her eyes toward Asahina receiving class in P.E.<br /> <br />“[Divine Protection of the Thunder God]. I think that Ability’s greatest terror lies in its speed. With that speed, maybe Amamori-kun could react, but normal people wouldn’t be able to right? That’s probably faster than we could react no matter how enhanced we were.”<br /> <br />If it was Asahina’s speed, it would explain all the hallucinations Kirido saw.<br /> <br />And if I was disguised as Kirido in that video, the mystery of the photos would be solved too.<br /> <br />But Kurashiki. The most important part is missing from your deduction.<br /> <br />“…That Asahina would cooperate with someone like me?”<br /> <br />“Yeah…I knew that much already.”<br /> <br />At my words, Kurashiki readily backed down, surprisingly.<br /> <br />That I’m collaborating with Asahina behind the scenes.<br /> <br />Let me state it clearly, the possibility is zero. Absolutely impossible.<br /> <br />No matter what, this is pure and simple fact.<br /> <br />…Well, anyone would realize that considering her personality.<br /> <br />I’ll ignore that Kurashiki indirectly called me ‘inhuman’ just now.<br /> <br />“Then I can only think you already have some other collaborator… Ahh, I misread you didn’t I, Amamori-kun, thinking you were a hopeless communication disorder loner…”<br /> <br />“Hey, don’t say sad stuff.”<br /> <br />It’s not that I can’t talk to anyone but you. I just don’t need to talk.<br /> <br />If I wanted to talk, I could talk to anyone. I could probably even talk to some random upperclassman girl I passed in the hall. What would happen after talking to her is another story though.<br /> <br />“Well, I’ll pry the identity of your other collaborator out of you another time…”<br /> <br />Prefacing with that, she returned her gaze to me again.<br /> <br />“My current guess is, Amamori-kun’s Ability is—a transformation Ability.”<br /> <br />“You seriously don’t listen do you.”<br /> <br />It makes me want to be the one to crack, seriously.<br /> <br />Thinking that, I deeply exhaled and swept my gaze around.<br /> <br />Let’s see, anyone who seems to be eavesdropping… Other than Asahina training in the distance, I don’t see anyone. I can’t understand at all why she’s so interested in me, but…well, she definitely can’t hear from this distance.<br /> <br />“…Yeah. Your guess isn’t wrong.”<br /> <br />“Oh, you’re gonna tell the truth?”<br /> <br />Kurashiki sidled right up to me. Meanwhile in the distance, Asahina’s body shook as she started glancing this way more frequently than before. What’s with these girls.<br /> <br />I heaved a single sigh, then confessed my ability again.<br /> <br />“My real Ability is [Transformation]. Commonly known as fourth-rank…a small fry Ability with no traits.”<br /> <br />Hearing my answer, Kurashiki made a very uninterested face.<br /> <br />Her expression said ‘That’s a lie too.’ I pretended not to see it.<br /> <br />“I disguised as Asahina to provoke Kirido right by his side. That’s the answer.”<br /> <br />Rather than disguise, I thoroughly ignored him. I figured that would make Kirido angrier.<br /> <br />On top of that, that fake love letter—you wrote it for me Kurashiki. It definitely had great effect based on Kirido’s screams I could hear faintly.<br /> <br />“But Amamori-kun, you were in the classroom with me the whole time right?”<br /> <br />“Was I? Maybe I’m having trouble remembering clearly after the shock of you punching me.”<br /> <br />“Maybe I should’ve punched you harder.”<br /> <br />At my flippant reply, she leaked words tinged with irritation.<br /> <br />“…Well, there’s no need for you to know me. As long as I don’t pry into you.”<br /> </p>







<p><br />Like I said before, she doesn’t need to know or trust me.<br /> <br />I just need her to listen to the plan and carry it out.<br /> <br />We’re merely cooperating and using each other in the end.<br /> <br />I think, you move. Our relationship is built on each exploiting the other—a warped relationship.<br /> <br />Yet even so, we can joke around like this…how strange.<br /> <br />Feeling an unpleasant presence approaching, I turned my gaze forward.<br /> <br />“Ah, uh, umm, Ame, Amemo, Amemo, Amamori-kun!”<br /> <br />Before me was Asahina stuttering as she gazed at me, and our classmates’ warm looks made me strangely uncomfortable.<br /> <br />“Cl-Classmate Asahina! I-If you want, let’s stretch toge—”<br /> <br />“Sorry, I’m recovering right now.”<br /> <br />“I won’t do it—I knew that already. Yes, I knew, Asahina Kasumi… Of course you’d refuse.”<br /> <br />Naturally rejected.<br /> <br />I had no intention of interacting with her in the first place. I was fully intent on using her as a piece too, but still, being clingy in daily life is a bit different. Maybe very different.<br /> <br />So I stick to the attitude, ‘You said you’d protect me from Kirido but didn’t protect me. You broke your promise so I’ve lost trust in you. Please don’t talk to me anymore?’<br /> <br />It doesn’t matter that Kirido is gone.<br /> <br />No matter how much you go ‘Mmm…’ it’s useless, Lady Asahina. I won’t cheer you up even if you’re depressed. I don’t want to talk to you, understand?<br /> <br />“Bu-But Amamori-kun! It’s because you’re injured now that stretching is especially important! After all, when injured you tend to get insufficient exercise! Non-strenuous stretching is optimal, I think! I won’t lose!”<br /> <br />However, Asahina didn’t seem to plan on giving up either.<br /> <br />Well, that last line, she was definitely pouring out her true feelings, but what is this girl saying?<br /> <br />When injured, be obedient and rest. That should be an ironclad rule.<br /> <br />Just as I started to reject her again—Asahina’s voice echoed over me.<br /> <br />“I-I couldn’t protect you… That won’t change, I don’t intend to change it. I don’t plan on making any excuses either. It’s my fault you were injured so many times. That fact absolutely won’t change. That sin will never disappear in my lifetime.”<br /> <br />“What are you saying—”<br /> <br />“That’s why—!”<br /> <br />Asahina’s voice echoed. This girl doesn’t seem to intend to let me get a word in edgewise.<br /> <br />Beside me, Kurashiki was laughing under her breath.<br /> <br />Asahina’s face flushed with tension as she clenched her fist before her and made her declaration.<br /> <br />“No matter how much I’m rejected, I won’t give up on you! This time for sure, I’ll stand by your side and protect you so you can live in peace! Even if it costs me this life!”<br /> <br />It was Asahina Kasumi’s declaration.<br /> <br />To protect me. I wondered if it was just big talk for a heroine of justice who would protect everyone, but even Asahina probably wouldn’t declare something like that thoughtlessly.<br /> <br />In the end, it must have been the answer she arrived at after consideration.<br /> <br />She gazed down straight at my eyes.<br /> <br />…Fine, Asahina Kasumi. If you’re saying that much, I have thoughts of my own too.<br /> <br />I stood up and stared Asahina straight on in return.<br /> <br />Surely the flame of determination must dwell in my eyes.<br /> <br />Seeing something in my flame-filled eyes, Asahina’s expression brightened—<br /> <br />“Um, please don’t talk to me, you’re annoying.”<br /> <br />—Asahina vomited blood.<br /> </p>
