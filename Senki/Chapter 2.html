<h1>Chapter 2: Helping My Sister’s Online Game Wife</h1>

</strong></p>



<p>It was Sunday, the day after making the costumes.</p>



<p>“Haaaru-nii! Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>Somewhere past 10 PM, as I diligently tackled a math workbook in preparation for the final exams, Kotomi knocked on my door with a sense of urgency.</p>



<p>“Come on in,” I called out through the door. She barged into the room with a burst of energy. Her expression was filled with impatience.</p>



<p>It was most likely emergency. However, Kotomi being in a rush was practically an everyday occurrence. In an instant, my mind went through four possible scenarios upon seeing that face. The most likely being—</p>



<p>“Are you having trouble with the sewing?” </p>



<p>Yes, it must be about sewing.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I coached her thoroughly until the date changed, and she managed to complete an all-white dress. Although the stitches were a bit rough, it was a world of difference compared to the crumpled fabric she started with. With newfound confidence, she expressed her determination to finish the rest on her own.</p>



<p>But clearly, she had hit a snag and sought help.</p>



<p>“No, it’s going fine for now.”</p>



<p>“Then, do you want help with your studies?”</p>



<p>The other day, Dad had declared that for every ten-point drop in her grades, he’d cut her allowance by ten percent. Kotomi, with teary eyes, tried to rely on me, but Dad insisted she figure it out on her own.</p>



<p>Still, after encountering a difficult problem, she turned to me for assistance.</p>



<p>“I want you to teach me math, but this time, it’s not about studying.”</p>



<p>“Is there a bug?”</p>



<p>“No. I can sense it, but until I see it, it’s the same as not being there.”</p>



<p>In a blink, three scenarios were debunked. That left only one option.</p>



<p>“Is it about Mahorin?”</p>



<p>She once rushed in with a similar distressed look, but back then, she was diligently studying according to Dad’s order. That’s why I didn’t expect it to be related to an online game this time.</p>



<p>“That’s right! It’s about Mahorin!”</p>



<p>Apparently, she decided to take a break from studying and indulged in online gaming. I hoped she just needed a breather and not her giving up on studies. Seriously, Dad’s genuinely concerned…</p>



<p>“Momoi-san is calling! We need to hurry!”</p>



<p>“A call for me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah! She said she’d call in ten minutes! And there are only nine minutes left!”</p>



<p>“No need to panic. Even if she calls, I can just say my battery’s dying and call her back later. Or is there some urgent reason to talk exactly in nine minutes?”</p>



<p>Perhaps she wanted to discuss our thoughts of an anime starting in nine minutes while watching it live? It could be a problem for anime that required prior information, but with my current otaku experiences, I’d somehow manage.</p>



<p>But, nine minutes from now would be… 22:18. It didn’t seem likely that an anime would start at such an odd time.</p>



<p>“It’s not exactly that, but…”</p>



<p>“Then calm down. If Dad finds out you haven’t been studying, you’ll be in trouble. Worst-case scenario, Mom might step in.”</p>



<p>Mom was scarier than Dad in our house. Dad was still being lenient towards Kotomi, but Mom never hesitated to scold her.</p>



<p>“O-okay…”</p>



<p>After taking a few deep breaths, Kotomi composed herself and spoke in a calmer tone.</p>



<p>“Takase-san might be an otaku.”</p>



<p>“Takase? Otaku, as in an anime otaku?”</p>



<p>There were various types of otaku—idol otaku, cooking otaku, health otaku, history otaku, and more. I never pegged Takase as an anime otaku, but Kotomi nodded.</p>



<p>“Momoi-san mentioned it. When she and Takase-san stopped by the convenience store today, Takase-san got a clear file of ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>.’”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it a promotional campaign? If you buy two ice creams, you get the clear file, right? Maybe she’s not into anime and just grabbed it because it’s free.”</p>



<p>“Momoi-san said the same thing.”</p>



<p>Takase didn’t give off the vibe of an anime enthusiast. Even when I visited Takase’s room the other day, I didn’t spot any anime merchandise.</p>



<p>But maybe she got into anime afterward. And if it was ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>,’ the reason would be…</p>



<p>“Maybe it all started when I brought plushies.”</p>



<p>“Does Takase-san have an interest in plushies?”</p>



<p>“It didn’t seem that way at first, but looking back, when I showed her the clear file image, she looked really focused.”</p>



<p>“Then it’s definitely love at first sight! I mean, it’s a god-tier illustration!”</p>



<p>Kotomi looked extremely happy. </p>



<p>I could understand her joy. She’d been looking for a chance to get closer to Takase, even going so far as to switch her bento to a basketball design.</p>



<p>When the other person was an otaku, it would naturally create a sense of familiarity. If they could bond over a shared interest for ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>‘, they should be able to chat more comfortably in the future.</p>



<p>Back to the matter at hand…</p>



<p>“What does Momoi want?”</p>



<p>From the gist of what I had heard so far, it didn’t seem urgent. The conversation could had easily concluded through chat without the need for a phone call.</p>



<p>“She wants your help to check if Takase-san is an otaku.”</p>



<p>“Help? How?”</p>



<p>“She’s going to explain that over the call… Phew, I’m glad I made it in time.”</p>



<p>Kotomi breathed a sigh of relief after having delivered the message before the time limit.</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll handle Momoi’s request. You focus on studying.”</p>



<p>“Huh? But I’m done for today…”</p>



<p>“It’s barely past 10pm. You can push for another hour.”</p>



<p>“B-but, math is so difficult…”</p>



<p>Was she asking for help with studying, or was it a pleading tone to seek comfort?</p>



<p>“I’ll teach you tomorrow. Focus on memorization for tonight. If you memorize before sleeping, it sticks in your brain while you’re asleep.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, I’ll try… I want to do lots of otaku activities with Momoi-san this summer…”</p>



<p>She had to put in effort here; her allowance would suffer otherwise. Despite wearing a pained expression, Kotomi mumbled her resolution and left the room.</p>



<p>Not long after that, the electronic tone of my smartphone filled the air. As soon as I answered the call, I heard a clear voice.</p>



<p><em>“I’m sorry for calling so late.”</em></p>



<p>“It’s fine. I was planning to stay up until midnight anyway.”</p>



<p><em>“That’s good. So, about Naru-chan, do you think she is an otaku?”</em></p>



<p>“It’s still hard to say. Does Takase often go to the convenience store?”</p>



<p><em>“When we go out, we usually stop by.”</em></p>



<p>“Did she ignore the anime merchandise during those times?”</p>



<p>Those campaigns weren’t a new thing. I wasn’t interested, but I knew about them. </p>



<p><em>“I remember she didn’t take any even though I thought it was a shame. However, this time, she happened to want the clear file and took it…”</em></p>



<p>“But using that at school isn’t practical, right?”</p>



<p><em>“Yeah, exactly. Even if Naru-chan intends to use it at home, she’s not the type to use clear files.”</em></p>



<p>True, Takase looked like the type to lose her printouts and wonder where she put them. Maybe that’s the reason she decided to use clear files after learning from past experiences. </p>



<p>Either way, it was all speculation.</p>



<p>“It’s best to ask the person directly…”</p>



<p><em>“Sorry, but that’s impossible for me.”</em></p>



<p>“Yeah, I figured…”</p>



<p>To ask if she liked ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>‘ was akin to revealing Momoi’s otaku side. It was method that couldn’t be executed by the closet otaku Momoi.</p>



<p>“I could ask, but it’d be weird that I know about the clear file when I wasn’t there…”</p>



<p>Even if I said I heard it from Momoi, Takase would still wonder why Momoi told me that information.</p>



<p><em>“Yeah, that’s why I’m considering another way.”</em></p>



<p>“Another way?”</p>



<p><em>“Karaoke<sup data-fn="a1e158d0-a912-4e9e-b386-e40d4326c396" class="fn"><a href="#a1e158d0-a912-4e9e-b386-e40d4326c396" id="a1e158d0-a912-4e9e-b386-e40d4326c396-link">1</a></sup>.”</em></p>



<p>“Karaoke? Do you mean taking Takase to karaoke to check if she would sing anime songs?”</p>



<p><em>“Not quite. Let’s sing a song from ‘Passionate Warrior Princess’ in front of Naru-chan and gauge her reaction. The opening from the first season has anime footage, so if she’s interested in the series, she should react.”</em></p>



<p>“That’s a solid plan, but won’t that expose you as an otaku?”</p>



<p><em>“That’s why I want Haruto-kun to sing it.”</em></p>



<p>“I see! That makes sense!”</p>



<p>My excitement rose, and my voice bounced with it.</p>



<p>Going to karaoke with Takase was beyond awesome! I really wanted to hear Takase sing! What songs would she choose I wonder… I bet she would look cute while singing!</p>



<p><em>“Will you help out?”</em></p>



<p>“Absolutely! But, is Takase actually going to join?”</p>



<p><em>“Club activities are on break starting tomorrow. And since Naru-chan loves karaoke, she’d come if I say we’d go there to lift our spirits.”</em></p>



<p>Alright! If that’s settled, I needed to wear a mask tonight! I better hydrate my throat and deliver a stellar performance!</p>



<p>“Will it just be us and Takase?”</p>



<p><em>“If possible, I want Kotomi-san to come too. She’d be less nervous if we all play together.”</em></p>



<p>I could tell Momoi was considerate of Kotomi in her own way. Momoi truly was a good friend. I was glad that Kotomi’s first friend was her.</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll ask her to join us.”</p>



<p><em>“Yes, please. I’m going invite Naru-chan as well. Please talk to Kotomi-san once we know Naru-chan’s answer.”</em></p>



<p>“Sure. I’ll be waiting for your update then.”</p>



<p>After ending the call and anxiously waiting, the incoming call tone chimed again. Why call when a message would do? She must have something else to discuss.</p>



<p>“Hello? How did it go?”</p>



<p><em>“Naru-chan is up for karaoke.”</em></p>



<p>Yes! Karaoke with Takase confirmed!</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll try inviting Kotomi now.”</p>



<p><em>“Thank you. Oh, and tomorrow, we’ll meet directly at the venue. Let’s gather at Manekineko in front of Kinjo Station.”</em></p>



<p>“Are you guys not stopping by anywhere?”</p>



<p><em>“No, we’ll head straight from school. It’d be a problem if other students see you and me leaving together… it’s not that I dislike you, so please don’t get the wrong idea, okay?”</em></p>



<p>Her voice sounded apologetic. </p>



<p>Kotomi had built up Momoi’s favor toward me as her gaming husband. But even without that, Momoi didn’t dislike me. The man-hating character she portrayed at school was a facade; in reality, she had mentioned before that she didn’t dislike any guys.</p>



<p>“I get it. We wouldn’t want any jealousy from the girls.”</p>



<p>I wasn’t a ladies’ man. Girls wouldn’t be jealous just because I was friendly with Momoi. However, if some guys started to approach Momoi because they thought they had a chance, it could trigger some jealousy from girls.</p>



<p><em>“I didn’t want to be the target of jealousy, but causing trouble for my friend would be even worse.”</em></p>



<p>In this case, ‘friend’ likely referred to me…</p>



<p>“Trouble?”</p>



<p><em>“The guys will get jealous if you walk home with me.”</em></p>



<p>Choosing different paths from school was her way of showing concern for me. She was really considerate.</p>



<p>“Jealousy won’t bother me much.”</p>



<p><em>“Why’s that?”</em></p>



<p>“Because there won’t be real harm. Think about it. I’m a 182-centimeter tough-looking guy.”</p>



<p>Even if they got jealous, no one was going to mess with a guy like me. Moreover, there were no losers in our class who would bully someone just for getting along with a cute girl.</p>



<p>Momoi probably understood that, but because of her past experiences with bullying in middle school, she became sensitive to such matters.</p>



<p><em>“True, Haruto-kun does have a tough look, but, oh, I mean it in a good way, of course!”</em></p>



<p>She hastily added, and I chuckled.</p>



<p>“Is there even a good thing for having a tough look?”</p>



<p><em>“It is. Lately, there’s been an increase in manga aiming for gap moe in the underworld. Like ‘Florist Yakuza’ or ‘Thug Librarian.’ And, of course, the one you recommended, ‘Otaku Gangster’!”</em></p>



<p>Suddenly, we dove into otaku talk, and my heart raced. I had absolutely no recollection of the titles she mentioned.</p>



<p>I wanted to ask Kotomi for help, but discussing it over the phone would make Momoi hear it. I had to somehow manage this on my own!</p>



<p>“Y-yeah! There has been an increase lately! That ‘gap moe’ in the underworld is awesome!”</p>



<p><em>“Yep! Starting this fall, we’ll have ‘Otaku Gangster,’ and the protagonist is none other than the veteran Saeki-san, you know? It’s bound to have an incredible gap!”</em></p>



<p>“Y-yes, Saeki-san! He’s great! Such a gap!”</p>



<p><em>“The PV looked promising too! That scene around the 30-second mark, I replayed it so many times!”</em></p>



<p>“Y-yeah, that scene! Great stuff there! I can’t wait for the fall season!”</p>



<p><em>“Me too! I’m looking forward to the fall season!”</em></p>



<p>“Definitely!”</p>



<p><em>“By the way, any recommendations from you, Haruto-kun?”</em></p>



<p>“Me!? Uh, let me think. There are quite a few. It’s tough to pick one.”</p>



<p><em>“You can exclude ongoing series.”</em></p>



<p>“Even then, there are still so many. Hey, isn’t the fall season… abundant?”</p>



<p>Please, let it be abundant! Let the god-tier anime lineup be overflowing! Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to smooth things over!</p>



<p><em>“Indeed! It’s quite abundant!”</em></p>



<p>Alright! It’s abundant!</p>



<p>“See? It’s just so abundant that it’s hard to narrow it down! I’ll think about it and let you know next time we chat!”</p>



<p><em>“Sounds good. I’ll be counting on you.”</em></p>



<p>Phew… I managed to get through that.</p>



<p>“By the way, for karaoke, is Kotomi going with me or with you and others?”</p>



<p>While exhaling relief, I steered the conversation back on track.</p>



<p><em>“I think it’d be better if she goes with you. You can catch a slightly later train, so take the chance to chat with Kotomi and help her relax.”</em></p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll check with Kotomi and send you a message once it’s confirmed.”</p>



<p>The call ended with her saying thank-you, and I walked to Kotomi’s room. When I knocked, she opened the door with an English vocabulary book in hand.</p>



<p>I thought she would be slacking off, but it seemed she was studying diligently.</p>



<p>“Is the call over?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. We’re going to karaoke tomorrow after school. I’ll sing the opening of ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>,’ and we’ll gauge Takase’s reaction to the anime footage to confirm if she’s an otaku. Oh, and Momoi wants you to come along.”</p>



<p>“Me too?”</p>



<p>If it were just Momoi and me, she would’ve agreed instantly, but with Takase joining, there was a noticeable nervousness on her face. </p>



<p>Still, overcoming this hurdle would bring her closer to Takase. Though it wasn’t confirmed that Takase was an otaku, playing together could help ease some tension. Taking the first step might be scary, but I hoped she’d gather the courage.</p>



<p>“If singing is embarrassing, you can just listen, and if the conversation stalls, I’ll step in. How about giving it a try?”</p>



<p>Kotomi looked hesitant, but…</p>



<p>“If Haru-nii is there, I’ll give it a shot.”</p>



<p>She clenched her fist tightly and nodded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The next day, as soon as the bell rang, Kotomi and I left the school.</p>



<p>As we strolled down our familiar route, Kotomi halted her steps when we deviated a bit.</p>



<p>“Are we taking a detour?”</p>



<p>“Just in the mood for a change of scenery.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t this a longer route?”</p>



<p>“No problem. We’ll still make it in time for the meetup.”</p>



<p>Even if it meant being one train behind, I already got Momoi’s permission. To ensure Kotomi enjoyed karaoke, I needed to ease her worries.</p>



<p>“That’s good then. It’d be bad if we were late.”</p>



<p>“If we all went together, there’d be no worry about being late.”</p>



<p>“True, but if you and Momoi-san go together, she will become even more popular.”</p>



<p>Kotomi knew that Momoi’s apparent dislike of guys was an act. At the amusement park, Momoi told her,<em> “Although I act cold at school, it’s not like I hate your brother.”</em></p>



<p>“More than that, I’m looking forward to karaoke!”</p>



<p>I beamed with enthusiasm. Emotions were contagious. If I could make my heart dance in joy, maybe Kotomi would start to feel excited too.</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to it, but… aren’t you nervous, Haru-nii?”</p>



<p>“Not at all. Momoi and Takase are both friends.”</p>



<p>While I wasn’t sure if Takase considered me a friend, she did invite me to her study group at her place. At the very least, she should saw me as more than just an acquaintance.</p>



<p>“How about you, Kotomi… still nervous?”</p>



<p>“A bit. I like karaoke, but I usually do it alone. Singing in front of people makes me really nervous…”</p>



<p>“But, back in middle school when we went on a family trip, you did karaoke.”</p>



<p>“That’s different. Family is family. Even if I’m out of tune, they wouldn’t make fun of me…”</p>



<p>Kotomi was overly concerned about others’ opinions. She could confidently perform in front of family, but with strangers, she worried about being judged if she made a mistake, causing her to shrink back and feel powerless.</p>



<p>“Well, there are people in the world who might make fun of someone for being tone-deaf, but Momoi and Takase aren’t like that. They’re both kind and won’t mock you. Don’t get discouraged just because you’re not good.”</p>



<p>Kotomi raised her eyebrows with a slight pout,”I-It’s not like I’m bad at it. I can easily score 90 with my signature song.”</p>



<p>“Really? That’s impressive. Then you should let Takase hear it.”</p>



<p>“But, it’s an anime song… it won’t be as fun if she doesn’t know it. I read online that singing unfamiliar songs can kill the mood.”</p>



<p>Since we were planning to go karaoke with Takase and the others, Kotomi had apparently researched about what people shouldn’t do at karaoke online.</p>



<p>“Don’t take internet info too seriously. If you’re with friends, you can have a blast even with unknown songs. Look, we have a guy named Yamada in our class, right?”</p>



<p>“Yamada-kun? Isn’t he Haru-nii’s friend?”</p>



<p>“That’s the one. He always sings obscure Western songs, but he sings with so much energy that it lightens up the mood. It’s always fun when we go together.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think I can sing with that kind of enthusiasm… I’d definitely get nervous.”</p>



<p>“In that case, leave the hype to me. You just focus on finishing a song. And little by little, you’ll get you used to singing.”</p>



<p>“Okay, I’ll focus on that.”</p>



<p>“And when Takase sings, make sure to listen attentively. It makes her happy when someone genuinely listens to her.”</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll listen carefully.”</p>



<p>“And if she talks to you, try to respond more than just nods. If you feel stuck, I’ll jump in and help.”</p>



<p>“I’ll try my best to talk.”</p>



<p>“That’s the spirit. With me around, you don’t need to worry about a thing. Let’s have a great time at karaoke!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s enjoy it!”</p>



<p>As we chatted, Kotomi seemed to loosen up, her face brightening. We eventually reached the station and boarded the train.</p>



<p>We arrived at Kinjo Station after about ten minutes. After we exited the station, we were greeted by a cluster of buildings.</p>



<p>Kinjo Town was an office district. It was a place less frequented by students, but for Kotomi who was an otaku, it could be considered a second home.</p>



<p>We walked along a bustling street and reached a multi-purpose building with seven floors. it housed various shops like anime, manga, card shops, internet cafes, karaoke, and more. Kotomi referred to this place as the “otaku paradise.”</p>



<p>“Remember, Kotomi, just relax.”</p>



<p>“Relax, relax…”</p>



<p>“…Are you ready?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah, I can do this.”</p>



<p>I rode the elevator with Kotomi, heading up to the third floor. As the doors parted, we saw two girls stood in front of the karaoke joint.</p>



<p>“Here they are! Hey, over this way!”</p>



<p>We hurried over to Takase who was energetically waving her hand.</p>



<p>“Sorry for making you wait.”</p>



<p>“We just got here too.”</p>



<p>“Did we take the same train?”</p>



<p>“Nope. We took an earlier one. But we got held up by someone trying to hit on Maho-chi.”</p>



<p>“Although you’re in school uniform, you’re still getting hit on? Was the guy also a high schooler?”</p>



<p>“More like a college student. Even if I were in casual clothes, it’s obvious I’m a high schooler. It’s ridiculous.”</p>



<p>I could understand the impulse to make a move since encountering a blonde high school girl with blue eyes wasn’t an everyday occurrence. Even so, I nodded in agreement with Momoi.</p>



<p>“Weren’t you scared?”</p>



<p>Kotomi asked with concern. Momoi responded with a cheerful smile.</p>



<p>“Not at all. I’m used to it by now.”</p>



<p>“That’s amazing. That’s what they call adult composure…”</p>



<p>“Maho-chi gets hit on all the time. When we went to the beach last year, it was crazy.”</p>



<p>“Even if I turned them down, different guys kept coming… I bought a new bikini, but I ended up wearing a rash guard halfway through.”</p>



<p>“Was it effective?”</p>



<p>“Better than nothing. I couldn’t enjoy the beach fully even though I bought a cute new bikini.”</p>



<p>If that was the case, hire me as a bodyguard for the next time you go. I’d gladly carry your stuff or whatever if it meant I got to see Takase in a swimsuit.</p>



<p>“Now, shall we hit the karaoke?” Momoi suggested, trying to change the subject.</p>



<p>We entered after passing through the automatic doors, and a female staff member greeted us with a smile.</p>



<p>“Welcome. A group of four?”</p>



<p>“Yes, four people.”</p>



<p>Momoi, the original planner, responded on our behalf.</p>



<p>“How long would you like to use the room?”</p>



<p>“Is two hours good for everyone?”</p>



<p>We all agreed, and Momoi said, “Two hours, please.”</p>



<p>After receiving microphones and glasses, we walked to the drink bar. As I was about to pour orange juice, my school uniform’s hem was tugged.</p>



<p>It was Takase.</p>



<p>“I want to talk with you alone, so stay here.”</p>



<p>Before I could say anything, Takase reached up and whispered. Her breath brushed my cheek, heating up my face.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010438.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p>“Would you both like some juice?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, sorry. I’m still deciding.”</p>



<p>“Me too. It’s hard to choose with so many options. You two go ahead first.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Momoi and Kotomi then walked towards the room. Once they were inside, Takase leaned in to speak quietly.</p>



<p>“You haven’t told Fujisaki-san that you’re dating Maho-chi, have you?”</p>



<p>Was she worried about that? Indeed, whether Kotomi knew or not could affect how Takase behaved.</p>



<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>



<p>If I said we were dating, Kotomi would feel hesitant to join our otaku activities with the three of us, thinking she’d be intruding on our dates.</p>



<p>But I couldn’t exactly pretend we weren’t dating either. If I blabbed about it, I’d betray Momoi’s trust.</p>



<p>“Why not tell her?”</p>



<p>“Because it’s embarrassing. Takase, could you tell your family if you got a boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“Hmm… When you put it that way, it does seem embarrassing.”</p>



<p>“See? So, let’s keep it between us and move on if you’re okay with that.”</p>



<p>“Wait, there’s something I want to ask, Fujisaki-kun.”</p>



<p>That was the main topic. Takase looked at me with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“Go ahead, tell me.”</p>



<p>“Thanks. I’m really counting on you.”</p>



<p>“Sure. What is it?”</p>



<p>“I want you to help me improve my relationship with Fujisaki-san. This is the first time I’ve been treated with caution by someone, and I don’t know what to do…”</p>



<p>“Takase, you’re not being treated with caution. That’s just her being shy, she even gets like that with kindergarten kids.”</p>



<p>“She’s that shy?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. When we were in middle school, we did a workplace experience at a kindergarten and she was super nervous. Instead of helping out, she ended up being taken care of by the kids. You don’t need to worry.”</p>



<p>“But she’s getting along fine with Maho-chi. Maybe the problem is my attitude…”</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. You’re actually really nice And… by the way, have you heard how the two of them became friends?”</p>



<p>I was about to mention their shared hobbies, but I rephrased my words.</p>



<p>Momoi and Kotomi became friends on a Sunday in early June. Since then, they started having lunch together with Takase and she just accepted it as if it were natural.</p>



<p>I didn’t know the details of how it was explained, but Momoi must have told Takase beforehand that Kotomi would be joining them from the next day.</p>



<p>“I’ve heard about it,” Takase nodded, “Maho-chi got harassed at the station, and Fujisaki-san, who happened to be nearby, called them out. After Maho-chi thanked her, they opened up to each other.”</p>



<p>Although the details about the amusement park and otaku stuff were left out, it was mostly accurate. That incident marked the beginning of their real-life friendship.</p>



<p>“After hearing that, I also wanted to become friends with Fujisaki-san. It’s scary to confront someone like that, but she gathered the courage for Maho-chi’s sake.”</p>



<p>“Kotomi will be happy to hear that. Honestly, she’s been wanting to be friends with you too.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. But she’s still nervous. If you push too hard, she might clam up… So, just be yourself and let things flow naturally. </p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll leave it to you, Fujisaki-kun.”</p>



<p>As if she trusting me, Takase gave me a refreshing smile and poured orange juice into her glass. I did the same and headed to the room with her.</p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting!”</p>



<p>Even though they hadn’t started singing, they seemed to be having fun discussing anime. I sat next to Kotomi, while Takase sat next to Momoi.</p>



<p>“Now then, shall we sing?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Who’s going to sing first?”</p>



<p>“Why not start with Maho-chi?”</p>



<p>“I still can’t decide what to sing. Oh, Haruto-kun, you look like you’ve already made up your mind.”</p>



<p><em>What kind of look is that? Well, I have, actually.</em></p>



<p>While I hoped Kotomi and Takase could become friends through this, the purpose of coming here was to confirm whether Takase was an anime fan or not. And that couldn’t start until I sang.</p>



<p>“Is it okay if I sing first?”</p>



<p>“Of course! Here you go.”</p>



<p>I accepted the tablet from Takase. The song I’d be singing was “Passionate Princess”. It was the opening theme from the anime series “<em>Passionate Warrior Princess: First Season</em>.” As soon as I selected it, the title appeared on the monitor.</p>



<p>Now, let’s see Takase’s reaction!</p>



<p>“Pa-sho-na-te…”</p>



<p>Ah, that’s the reaction of someone who didn’t know this song.</p>



<p>“It’s ‘<em>Passionate Princess</em>.’”</p>



<p>“Is it a Western song?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s Japanese.”</p>



<p>It was clearly a reaction from someone who didn’t watch anime. It seemed unlikely that Takase was an anime lover. Despite resigning to this fact, there was no backing out now since I already selected the song.</p>



<p>I gripped the microphone as the upbeat intro began to play. The anime character began appearing on the monitor.</p>



<p>It showed Hot Blood-chan in casual mode. She dashed toward a cliff and jumped off with her arms spread wide. When her whole body glowed, she transformed into the Passionate Warrior Princess and soared into the sky, with the title logo appearing against the blue backdrop.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the song started, and I began to sing the opening theme with fervor. I glanced at Takase, who was subtly swaying to the rhythm.</p>



<p>After I finished the song, everyone applauded.</p>



<p>“You’re good, Haruto-kun.”</p>



<p>“Great job, Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>“So, Fujisaki-kun also likes Passionate Warrior Princess, huh?”</p>



<p>I wasn’t the only one surprised by that statement. Kotomi and Momoi were also staring at Takase intently. If Takase said ‘also’, that would mean…</p>



<p>“Takase, do you also like the series?”</p>



<p>“I don’t know the story, but I think the characters are cute.”</p>



<p>“You don’t watch the anime?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“Then when you said ‘also,’ who else were you referring to?”</p>



<p>“I meant Fujisaki-san. Remember when you were sewing dresses for Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan plushies the other day? You said it was for Fujisaki-san, but it turns out Fujisaki-kun also likes them.”</p>



<p><em>Ah, I see. That explains it.</em></p>



<p>“Wait, Haruto-kun, you did that?” Momoi interjected with surprise.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be a present from Kotomi to Momoi, so I didn’t want to reveal my involvement. But now that it was out in the open, there was no helping it.</p>



<p>“Yeah. Kotomi asked me to do it.”</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-kun is amazing! Even though he pricked his fingers multiple times, he was determined to finish it by the end of the day for his sister!”</p>



<p>“He’s really kind,” Momoi looked impressed.</p>



<p>“And you know, if he’s putting in that much effort, it means you really love that character, right, Fujisaki-san?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah. I love it…”</p>



<p>“Exactly. That’s why I got the clear file.”</p>



<p>With a smile, Takase took out a clear file from her bag. It featured an illustration of all the characters from “<em>Passionate Warrior Princess.”</em></p>



<p>As she handed it over, Kotomi looked bewildered.</p>



<p>“W-why are you handing it to me?”</p>



<p>Takase scratched her cheek shyly, “Um, I just… want to get closer to you. I wasn’t sure what would make you happy, but I thought you might like this. So, here, consider it a token of our friendship.”</p>



<p>She handed it over with a smile, and Kotomi accepted it with a bashful glance. Holding the clear file close to her chest, she stammered;</p>



<p>“T-thank you… for wanting to be friends with someone like me. I’m not really good at talking, and I’m kind of a loner…”</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s talk a lot from now on.”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah. I want to chat with Takase-san too… But I don’t know what to talk about… We don’t have any common topics…”</p>



<p>“What are your hobbies, Fujisaki-san?”</p>



<p>“Anime, manga, and games. And you, Takase-san?”</p>



<p>“Sports, fashion, and foreign dramas.”</p>



<p>While they didn’t seem to have any overlapping hobbies, there were still a common topic to discuss. They probably hadn’t realized it themselves, and if I were going to throw them a lifeline, this was the moment.</p>



<p>“If it’s common topics you’re looking for, I’ve got one.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Haru-nii, tell me.”</p>



<p>“Both of you are really bad at studying.”</p>



<p>Takase looked at Kotomi with surprise.</p>



<p>“Eh, Fujisaki-san, you’re bad at studying? But you’re Fujisaki-kun’s sister, I thought you must be super smart.”</p>



<p>“I’m not smart at all… I ranked 30th from the bottom on the last test.”</p>



<p>“Eh, 30th from the bottom!? I was 31st from the bottom!”</p>



<p>“R-really? You’re one rank above me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah! Well, that makes us rivals! I’ll beat you next time!”</p>



<p>“I want to cheer you on, but I can’t afford to lose either. There’s a reason I can’t lose!”</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s a cool line! What’s the reason?”</p>



<p>“My allowance gets cut by ten percent for every ten places I drop…”</p>



<p>“A maximum cut of 30% must hurt… We better give it our all!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s do our best! But since we’re here at karaoke, I kinda want to forget about studying for now.”</p>



<p>“I get it! Me too! Let’s sing a lot today!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, let’s sing! Though I only know anime songs…”</p>



<p>“That’s fine. Let me hear them!”</p>



<p>Being encouraged to sing anime songs, Kotomi’s face brightened with joy.</p>



<p>“Can I sing next?”</p>



<p>“Sure. Sing your heart out!”</p>



<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>



<p>Kotomi took the touchscreen and began selecting an anime song. Momoi then looked at me with an expectant gaze.</p>



<p>“Haruto-kun, shouldn’t you stand up soon?”</p>



<p>“Stand up?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re the type who starts doing otagei when you hear anime songs, right?”</p>



<p><em>I totally forgot about that setup!</em></p>



<p>“W-What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“The other day when we went to karaoke, you suddenly started dancing when anime songs leaked from the next room. It was so hilarious!”</p>



<p>“I wanna see that, I wanna see!”</p>



<p>It was embarrassing to show otagei to my crush, but since they were looking at me with such expectation, I couldn’t just sit still.</p>



<p>“I want to dance, so hurry up and play an anime song!”</p>



<p>I ended up having to show off the otaku moves because Kotomi said something unnecessary in the chat. Perhaps feeling apologetic, Kotomi was hesitant about choosing a song.</p>



<p>“Okay,” Kotomi said, finishing her selection.</p>



<p>She chose the opening song of <em>“Passionate Warrior Princess Season 2.” </em>As the intro played, Kotomi started singing, and at the same time, I vigorously shook my hips and spun my arms at high speed.</p>



<p>“Hahaha, you’re good, you’re good!”</p>



<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s funny. The contrast between your appearance and your movements… hahaha.”</p>



<p>Takase and Momoi laughed amusingly, and even Kotomi burst into laughter. It was super embarrassing, but if they were having fun, then that’s all that mattered.</p>



<p>And so, amidst the lively atmosphere, we all enjoyed karaoke to the fullest.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010446.png" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After our two-hour karaoke session, we left ManekiNeko. </p>



<p>Despite it being past 7 PM, the sky was still bright. Office workers finishing work, shuffled along the streets, creating the same bustling atmosphere as during the day.</p>



<p>“Ah, singing our hearts out was so much fun!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it was a blast. I think I overdid it. My throat feels hoarse.”</p>



<p>“Me too. Oh, right! Fujisaki-san, how about we exchange contact info?”</p>



<p>“Sure! I’d like that too.”</p>



<p>“Awesome! Also, can I call you Kotomi-chan?”</p>



<p>“Of course! It gets confusing since I have the same last name as Haru-nii.”</p>



<p><em>Please call me Haruto-kun too! And while we’re at it, exchange contact info with me too! Ahh, I’m jealous of Kotomi!</em></p>



<p>But just being envious wouldn’t progress things with Takase. Asking her to call me by my first name would be strange when we weren’t even dating, but at this point, it shouldn’t be odd to suggest exchanging contacts.</p>



<p>“Hey, how about exchanging contacts with me too?”</p>



<p>Once they finished exchanging contacts, I brought it up.</p>



<p>“Huh, with Fujisaki-kun…?”</p>



<p><em>What’s with that reaction? It’s not like she’s repulsed… but she looks hesitant..</em>.</p>



<p>Did I overstep my bounds? Maybe I should have taken it slow and steady to deepen our relationship…</p>



<p>It was too late for regrets now. I needed to come up with a valid reason to exchange contact info even if it was an afterthought!</p>



<p>“Um, you know, in case you ever need help with studies, it’d be handy to have each other’s contact info, right?”</p>



<p>“It would be handy, but…”</p>



<p>Takase furrowed her brows and glanced briefly at Momoi.</p>



<p>“Is there something on my face?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s not that… Maho-chi, can I talk to you for a sec?”</p>



<p>Takase beckoned, and Momoi headed over to where she was. Takase leaned in and whispered something to her.</p>



<p>Momoi, who had a serious expression, suddenly burst into laughter.</p>



<p>“You really don’t have to worry about that.”</p>



<p>“But… aren’t you bothered?”</p>



<p>“I’d rather you didn’t hesitate like that.”</p>



<p>“Really? You’re not being considerate, are you?”</p>



<p>“Not at all. If you want that, feel free to do so.”</p>



<p>“Alright. Then I’ll do it.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing words like “don’t worry,” “bothered,” and “hesitate,” I could sense what was going on. Takase must have hesitated because she was afraid that exchanging contact information with me would make Momoi worried or suspect me of cheating.</p>



<p><em>Phew, so it’s not that she doesn’t want to… </em></p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting! Let’s exchange contact info!”</p>



<p>“Okay.”</p>



<p>After a year and three months of unrequited love, I finally got Takase’s contact info!</p>



<p>The beginning was crucial for things like this. If you neglected to keep in touch, it would be harder to send messages later. When I got back, I should send a greeting and build an atmosphere where we could chat casually.</p>



<p>After exchanging contact info, we headed to Kinjo Station.</p>



<p>“I’ll take a taxi home then.”</p>



<p>After arriving at the station, Momoi said this. It seemed like she lived in Kinjo Town. She also had taken a taxi home the last time we went karaoke.</p>



<p>“Oh, wait. There’s something I want to talk to you about, Momoi-san.”</p>



<p>“To me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. If you’re busy, we can talk on the phone… but it’s something important, so I thought it’d be better to talk face-to-face.”</p>



<p>“That’s fine.”</p>



<p>“The train’s coming soon, so I’ll head off first.”</p>



<p>“Okay. Bye, Takase-san, see you at school.”</p>



<p>“Make sure not to rush onto the train!”</p>



<p>“Later, Takase.”</p>



<p>While waving goodbye, Takase hurried into the station.</p>



<p>As for why I didn’t follow Takase, it was because Kotomi had grabbed the hem of my uniform. Apparently, the conversation they were about to have was relevant to me. Or maybe she just didn’t want to go home alone.</p>



<p>“So, what’s this about?” </p>



<p>Seemingly nervous about the serious conversation, Momoi’s face tensed slightly.</p>



<p>“Um, you see, the plushies that Haru-nii was making wasn’t actually a gift for me, it was a gift from me to Momoi-san.”</p>



<p>Kotomi decided it would be better to come clean about the plushies since my involvement had been revealed.</p>



<p>“A gift… like a birthday present?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I actually wanted to make it myself, but I’m really clumsy… and Haru-nii isn’t good at it either. So we ended up asking Takase-san for help. Haru-nii learned how to sew from Takase-san and then taught me…”</p>



<p>Her clumsy friend was working hard on making plushies for her. I thought Momoi would be excited, but she seemed perplexed. And for some reason, she was looking at me instead of Kotomi.</p>



<p>“So, does that mean you hurt your fingers because of me, Haruto-kun?”</p>



<p>“Well, when you put it like that, I guess so. But don’t worry, it wasn’t deep and it’s almost healed by now.”</p>



<p>“But… didn’t it hurt?”</p>



<p>“It just stung for a moment.”</p>



<p>“But you pricked yourself multiple times, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I did.”</p>



<p>“And you didn’t mind?”</p>



<p>“Not at all.”</p>



<p>I got to spend time with Takase, keep my promise to help Kotomi, and make a birthday present for Momoi. I would never give up halfway just because I pricked my fingers with a needle.</p>



<p>Momoi fidgeted with her thighs. <em>Does she need to go to the toilet?</em></p>



<p>“Why did you go to such lengths for me?”</p>



<p>“Because I want to make you happy.”</p>



<p>“Is making me happy beneficial to you?”</p>



<p>Was it surprising that I’d put in effort for Momoi? …Maybe it was. Unlike other guys, I didn’t have romantic feelings for her, so there was no need for me to butter her up.</p>



<p>However, just because there were no romantic feelings didn’t mean there was no affection. To maintain our friendship, it would be best to be clear about my feelings.</p>



<p>“It’s not about gain or loss. I like you as a friend and care about you. I just want to see you smile. That’s all.”</p>



<p>“Is… is that so? Huh…”</p>



<p>Her blue eyes blinked, and her fair skin gradually flushed red. <em>Hey, don’t react like that. It’s making me embarrassed too.</em></p>



<p>But since she was smiling happily, I didn’t intend to take back my words.</p>



<p>“If you care about me that much… I’ll let you join the celebration too, Haruto-kun,” Momoi said, blushing as she turned away.</p>



<p>“Can I come too?”</p>



<p>“Yes. We’re having a party at Ran-chan’s café from 1PM on July 2nd. Naru-chan and Aoi-chan will be there too.”</p>



<p>Momoi looked at Kotomi with concern and added, “I know it can be nerve-wracking with everyone there, so I was thinking of inviting you to the café on a different day… But if you’d like, would you join us, Kotomi-san?”</p>



<p>“I’d love to.”</p>



<p>“Even though Kotobuki and Aoki will be there, are you okay with that?”</p>



<p>“I’ll be nervous, but I want to celebrate with Momoi-san.”</p>



<p>Kotomi… she had really grown. If she kept this up, overcoming her shyness and maybe improving her grades by about 70 places, our parents would surely be relieved.</p>



<p>Momoi was also happy, perhaps because she knew how shy Kotomi was.</p>



<p>“Thank you. There will be a delicious cake too, so look forward to it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Oh… Momoi-san, are you keeping your otaku interests a secret? Won’t everyone find out you’re an otaku once I give you the plushies? Especially since Takase-san knew about the <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>.”</p>



<p>“That’s where you can use wrapping paper or a box and say ‘<em>open it later</em>.’ Or better yet, just come clean about being an otaku.”</p>



<p>I didn’t want to force Momoi, but it was a good opportunity to tell her close-knit group that she was an otaku. I wasn’t suggesting she started talking about otaku stuff at school, but revealing her hobbies to her friends should make her feel more at ease.</p>



<p>“I’m scared to come clean, but… to be honest, I want to sing anime songs too.”</p>



<p>“You should have sung then. Takase was smiling when she listened to anime songs, right?”</p>



<p>Some people might look down on otaku hobbies, but at least Takase wasn’t one of them. She accepted anime songs and became friends with Kotomi even after knowing she was an otaku.</p>



<p>“I wonder if Ran-chan and Aoi-chan will accept it…”</p>



<p>“They will. After all, the plushies were made at Kotobuki’s house. And Aoki even invited me to the club. If she can accept my thug face, there’s no way she wouldn’t accept her friend’s hobbies.”</p>



<p><em>So go ahead and tell them, </em>I encouraged her. </p>



<p>Momoi looked at me with a hopeful gaze. In a voice that sounded almost like a plea, she asked;</p>



<p>“…Would you also come clean about being an otaku with me, Haruto-kun?”</p>



<p>“Me?”</p>



<p>“Do you… not want to?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind. I’ll come clean for your sake, Momoi.”</p>



<p>Even if I came clean with her, the three of them would react the same way. But if Momoi’s feelings changed, that was a different story. If that gave her courage, then I had no hesitation.</p>



<p>“So, what do you say?” I asked.</p>



<p>Momoi nodded decisively.</p>



<p>“I’ll give it a try.”</p>
