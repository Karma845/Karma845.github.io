<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_18">Chapter 57: Rescue – Part two</h1>

	<p class="block_2">I gasp.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m at a loss for words.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“A-are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila is the first to come to her senses.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Her words also bring me back, and I follow her.</p>

	<p class="block_2">What we see are two women with deathly pale faces, who are struggling to even breathe.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Their bodies are covered in blood, and it hurts to even look at them. It looks like after it assaulted them, it crushed the eyes of one of them.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila, who was approaching them, sees this, and stops dead in her tracks. Her outstretched hand stops too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Leila, please move aside.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I approach the two women and cast Heal on both.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Did we make it in time?</p>

	<p class="block_2">Their wounds heal quickly, but they don’t really react. Did they lose too much blood?</p>

	<p class="block_2">If the blood splashed all around this room is all theirs, they lost a lot.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I can heal wounds with Heal, but that doesn’t bring back lost blood.</p>

	<p class="block_2">What do I do?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look at Leila, and she’s crying while holding their hands and praying.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Their breathing isn’t stabilizing, and it’s getting weaker.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I…</p>

	<p class="block_2">Call out to Alchemy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look through the list of transmutable items, and find something.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I take two dead orcs out of the Item Box.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila looks surprised by this sudden development. She’s about to say something, but I have to ignore it and hurry.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I carve their bodies and retrieve their magic stones.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The materials I need are magic stones and blood. At first I worry about blood types and stuff like that, but there are universal hematopoietics too, so I don’t think that’s a problem. The description doesn’t mention anything like blood types either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I drip my own blood into a magic stone, and infuse it with magic energy. After doing the same to the other, I feel like I’m the one who’s about to collapse from anemia.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I manage to stay on my feet, and hand one of the completed items to Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Have one of them drink this.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Normally, it should be injected or transfused, but having them drink it should be fine. As for the taste… I don’t know about that, but I wouldn’t want to drink it. They’ll just have to bear with it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hold one of the women, and place the vial near her mouth before I start pouring.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I do it slowly, being careful not to make her choke.</p>

	<p class="block_2">By the time the hematopoietic in the vial is half gone, color starts to return to her face. Maybe it’s just my imagination, but I feel like her breathing is stabilizing too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">After being very careful, I manage to have her drink the whole thing. It looks like Leila is done too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What was that!?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila yells as I put away the dead orcs.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hey… They’re resting. Let’s be quiet.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hum, how you made that thing that looked like a potion. And the thing itself too.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s a weird way to put it, but I get it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“The answer to the first question is alchemy. And what I made were hematopoietics.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Alchemy? Hematopoietics?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Think of it as something to replenish lost blood. Haven’t you seen alchemy before?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Not that I’ve seen other people use alchemy either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I-I see. I didn’t understand because it was different from the way an alchemist I know does it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">So my method really isn’t ordinary.</p>

	<p class="block_2">If she asks me to tell her more about it, I’ll have to say that’s just the way I was taught.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Let’s just take them out of here for now. Can you wake them up?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“They’re fast asleep, so I don’t think so.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then we have to carry them. It’d be better to take it easy, but we’re in trouble if the orcs that left return.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">From what I can see on Map, we should be fine, but we would be in trouble if they show up while the two sleep. Especially if they blocked the exit.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, we should get away from the cave.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">It’s a good thing neither woman is big.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We head for the exit through the same path we took when we came here.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Sora, can you close this hole?</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s also to destroy the place where the orcs will come back to, but apparently monsters have a tendency to make places like caves their lairs, so leaving them be is dangerous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I use Earth Magic to destroy the entrance, and make sure they can’t dig their way in.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Afterwards we take a break, and about an hour later we head back to the village.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I-I am fine.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She doesn’t look fine.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Let’s end it here for today. I’m sure you’re tired too. We’d be in trouble if you pushed yourself too much and couldn’t walk any more.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Not to mention that she’s carrying a woman on her back through the forest, and she was tired before we began. It’s a wonder she made it this far.</p>
	<p class="block_2">I flatten the ground with Earth Magic, and start getting ready to camp.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila looks kind of astonished, but I ignore it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I spread a sheet on the ground, and we lay the two women on it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">While I’m at it, I heat up a pot and start making a simple soup. I haven’t drained the blood yet, so I can’t use orc meat, but I use the wolf meat and vegetables I have left. Should I make it taste like consommé? I’ve been experimenting with seasonings every day, but it’s still far from what I want.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Eat a little and sleep. We’ll keep walking after that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Very well. But we should take turns keeping watch.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m sure her stamina is reaching its limit. She doesn’t argue with what I said, but she’s worried about monsters attacking. It makes sense, we are camping in a forest after all.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I have monster repellent, so I’ll use that. Let’s just rest for now.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">To be honest, I’m still tired from fighting too. I lost quite a bit of blood too. I need to replenish my nutrients and rest in preparation for tomorrow.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I check our surroundings with Map.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The orcs that left have almost reached the wagons, but haven’t gotten there yet. I’m sure they’re planning to attack.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The group that went to Hikari and the others isn’t moving. They’re pretty close to the village, but obviously they can’t just walk in.</p>

	<p class="block_2">As I’m thinking about this, I start hearing the sound of someone sleeping.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It was a nerve-racking day. Leila was assaulted by drowsiness the moment she laid down. I put a sheet over her, and go to sleep too.</p>
