	<p class="block_2">I feel like I’m floating, and then my consciousness awakens.</p>

	<p class="block_2">When I open my eyes, I see Leila’s face right in front of mine.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Her strong eyes have become quiet, as she looks at me with concern.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Our eyes meet, and Leila’s face suddenly turns red like it just caught fire.</p>

	<p class="block_2">What happened? Wait, this soft feeling on the back of my head, this position…</p>

	<p class="block_2">Maybe it’s a dream, but let’s enjoy it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I close my eyes, and relax my body.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But then I’m shaken and forcibly brought back.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She asks with a worried tone.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. What happened after I passed out?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I try to get up, but pain runs through my body.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I check my status, and see my HP has fallen to critical levels, I’ve recovered quite a bit of MP for some reason, and my SP is also critical. But I’m slowly recovering, thanks to Natural Recovery Boost.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“The orclord has been defeated.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila’s face twists. I then notice that both her hands are burned.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Your hands.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“These are badges of honor.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I use People Appraisal on Leila, and see her level has gone up by more than ten.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Does that mean she finished it off? With that hot mithril sword?</p>

	<p class="block_2">She tells me what happened after I passed out, and just as I thought, she ended the orclord.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila was unsure of whether or not the orclord was even conscious at that point, but she pulled out her mithril sword, and cut off its head.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“T-that’s surprising. I figured you were scarred or something since you wear a mask, but, hum, you’re pretty.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">What is she saying? It’s cute how she’s a little embarrassed as she says it, but…</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hn? Mask?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I put my hand on my face. The mask is gone. Did Lloyd punch it away!?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It’s because apparently my black hair and black eyes stand out. Hum, I’d appreciate it if you kept quiet about this.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I say because I’m unable to find a good excuse.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. No, you are probably correct.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I thank her and get up. I’m guessing the mask has fallen near Lloyd.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look that way, and see its head on the ground.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Its face is burned, and has a ghastly expression. Looking at it directly creeps me out.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I pick up the mask and put it back on my face. That feels better… Not really.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m still dizzy. I’m recovering, but I did run out of MP, so my body feels heavy and languid.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The mithril sword is also on the ground. I can feel the heat coming from it when I get close.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I pick it up to see if it will burn me too, but while I do feel some heat, it doesn’t burn me. Is it because it’s my magic?</p>

	<p class="block_2">But Leila can’t use it like this. I make magic energy flow, while imagining the sword cooling off.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I use Appraisal to see if it’s all right, and see it’s become a level two mithril sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hm… I’ll pretend I didn’t see that.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Don’t overexert yourself. I honestly thought you died at first.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. And you looked after me?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">What’s wrong? Is her face getting red again?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’m all right. Oh, and show me your hands.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">My stock of potions is almost depleted… I should save what I have left in case something happens.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Instead, I cast Heal on Leila’s hands.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The burned palms heal like time is being rewound. It’s still strange to look at no matter how many times I see it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“How do you feel?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“G-great. Thank you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hand her the mithril sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She fearfully takes it, probably because she’s remembering when it burned her.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What do we do with the orcs?”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“What do you mean?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Aren’t we going to take them back with us?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“There is no item bag that can fit all of this. The pouch I’m carrying gets full when I put my equipment and items into it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. Then I’ll take them.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I approach them and start storing them in the Item Box. Hikari will be happy about this, but I need to make sure to share the spoils with everyone. Apparently orc meat goes for a good price.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I store twenty four of them, but there’s still room because the spent potions left a lot of empty space.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“W-w-what? Is this storage magic?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Ah… And it’s also kind of a secret.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Usually I pretend I’m taking things out of a pouch or an item bag, but an item bag that could store so many orc corpses would have to be a very efficient, and very expensive one.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“We should go back. Casey and the others must be concerned.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Wait. Let’s check the back.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">I point to where Lloyd came from.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Map is showing me two people there.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s right. There should still be people there.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila and I walk to the back. I’m recovering, but it’s still hard to walk. I’m not feeling tired, I feel languid, so I’m guessing the Walking skill doesn’t cover it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We keep walking silently. It’s awkward.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m not a good talker to begin with, and Leila seems kind of fidgety. I see her about to start talking, but immediately stopping. It’s kind of suspicious actually.</p>

	<p class="block_2">This indescribable mood continues until we reach the room at the end.</p>

	<p class="block_2">No, that mood is completely blown away the moment we get there.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s a bizarre sight, colored bloody red.</p>
