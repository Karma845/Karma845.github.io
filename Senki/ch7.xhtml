<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see it too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was on lunch break, the day after meeting the daughter of the Duke of Auguste. As usual, I was eating in the courtyard with Elt-san, who had nudged me with a rather pale face. He looked like a mouse who had come across a starving feline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of food, the marron cake from the other day was incredibly delicious. I had to settle for berry cake, but I was able to get a bite of Elt-san’s. In direct contrast, Arina-san had memorably declared that she would never share hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see it, indeed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered my coworker’s question while keeping my line of sight as inconspicuous as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if my face was as pale as his, but I felt strangely chilly. But when my hand brushed the sword at my side, I began to calm down, and my heart rate gradually normalized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to Elt-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She… Uh, why are you looking at me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It has to be your fault somehow. She can’t see me at this angle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, I don’t know. Maybe she’s a big fan of yours and just wanted to see you in person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I doubt it. I’ve seen her many times before, and she’s never approached me. I mean—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He glanced at the tree in the corner of the garden and muttered fearfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess, could you really be staring at me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked in the same direction: at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A familiar girl with silver hair was staring at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not just any girl, but Her Highness. Moreover, she seemed to be looking in my direction as opposed to Elt-san’s… Oh, our eyes met. At that moment, she pouted. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s adorable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you provoke her somehow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t remember. We almost never talk… no, that’s not right. We did once, late at night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So if you did offend her, it must have been then? You should apologize as soon as possible. Cut your stomach while you’re ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d rather not. I can’t apologize if I don’t know what to apologize for! And in the first place, we still don’t know if she’s actually mad at me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My speech faltered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I peered at Her Highness, I noticed she had some sort of paper. She wrote something down, carefully reread it, and folded it and tossed it in my direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sensed magic on the paper, so I cast a spell to create a breeze, gently directing the paper in a parabola straight into my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A letter from Her Highness? What did she write?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unfolded the paper in confusion and tensed up at its contents. Likewise, Elt-san’s body stiffened, and he turned his face towards mine awkwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Please come here at a different time.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up to see the sender smiling at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, however, was panicking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was nice knowing you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elt-san put his hand on my shoulder and tried to console me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, I’m not dead yet, and I’m not going to die for a while. So stop treating me like it’s the end!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More so than my actual work, this lunch break turned out to be today’s most tiring experience…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time passed, as it always does, and soon it was midnight. The moon had risen to its highest point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I anxiously arrived at the fountain in the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is this all about? What does she need from me?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier today, I was so nervous that I couldn’t concentrate on my job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really didn’t know. I’d only ever spoken to Her Highness that one night, and I was sure I hadn’t messed up anywhere else. So then why had there been such a displeased look on her face?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I made you wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was staring at the moon, a figure approached me without notice and spoke. Of course, it was the princess. Unlike before, she was wearing a cardigan more suitable for outdoor weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feared that my anxiety would reveal itself in my voice if I responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I was late, even though I called you here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness repeated her apology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We moved towards the bench and sat side by side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An uncomfortable silence filled the air between us. I didn’t know why Her Highness wasn’t speaking. To be fair, I didn’t know what to say myself. I rarely ever dealt with women who were in a bad mood, and somehow her silence made the situation even worse.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do… Maybe I just don’t understand the delicate feminine spirit.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Yesterday, I received a letter from Lena.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lena…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, she is the eldest daughter of the Duke of Auguste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name had slipped my mind, but I remembered now. Just the other day, she had been obsessing over a marron cake to the point of having tears in her eyes. Now that I thought about it, that was a pretty impressive encounter. Just remembering the expression on her face made me stifle a laugh. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, so this letter arrived on the same day it was sent…</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this the swiftness of aristocrat mail?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said in the letter that she met you… and had a good time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I met Lena-san the other day. We had tea at the cafe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lena… Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pout was even stronger than before. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I mess up again?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you have a good time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? No, uh, I was more surprised than anything else… Well, it was fun in its own way, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Hmph.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… Is something the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness’s mood seemed to worsen the more I talked. My anxiety was building by the second. I had to do something… but I didn’t know what.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… are you and Lena-san… not on good terms?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not the case. It’s just that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess sat there, fidgeting with her index fingers. She tilted her head, parted her lips, and softly murmured a single word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Richena.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… I want you to call me by my name, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness blushed and looked away shyly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I just fell in love a little.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To call her by her name… her name… it was hard to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… well, you don’t think that would be troublesome?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, why should it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, do you mean—um, how do I say it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silent pressure. This was what they called an unstoppable force, right? No matter how hard I struggled, it was clear that she wouldn’t let me go until I called her name. She was holding my arm at this very moment. I cursed my face for blushing uncontrollably. A sensational softness was assaulting my elbow.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, there’s no point thinking about it. I just need to make a decision!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey… do you think you could let me go? …Richena-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Richena-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One last time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Richena-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t normally get nervous calling a girl by her name, but this… was something of an exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness—or rather, Richena-san— stood up with a mixture of embarrassment and joy, and bowed to me with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s getting late, so I will go back now. I’m sorry for asking you to meet at this unreasonable time…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s all right. Richena-san, it will be cold tonight, so please stay warm and rest—oh, excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood and reached out towards her. Her body trembled as my hand brushed her glowing silver hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There were a few leaves in your hair. They must have fallen from the tree. I’m sorry, suddenly approaching you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were unfocused. However, she immediately returned to reality, and with a sudden exclamation of “Excuse me!”, ran past me into the palace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched her disappear, and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Richena-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering to myself, I ambled back to my room as well.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a feeling that tomorrow will be a dreary morning.</span></i></p>
