<h1>First Part</h1>

<h3>Chapter 1: Childhood Friend Hanazono Hana</h3>



<p> <br />The first time I ate the onigiri my childhood friend made for me…I was moved by how delicious it was, I felt something welling up from my chest.<br /> <br />[Hanazono: I see you smiling now. It’s the first time I’ve seen your face like that.]<br /> <br />My childhood friend next to me was laughing at my reaction.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />The end of school bell rings. Today I finished school without talking to anyone, as usual.<br /> <br />I’m always alone in the classroom.<br /> <br />As the classroom bustles around me, I get lost in thought.<br /> <br />I, Toudou Tsuyoshi, went to a special elementary school.<br /> <br />…Due to various circumstances, I started going to a local middle school.<br /> <br />Most students at my local middle school came from the local elementary school.<br /> <br />So I wasn’t able to make any friends. Or rather, I was never taught how to make friends.<br /> <br />I made it to high school second year without having any friends.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–That weird kid with no common sense whose head is messed up.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That’s how my classmates evaluate me.<br /> <br />Some eccentric girls still approach me.<br /> <br />My childhood friend from kindergarten, the class president from my class, an energetic underclassman, and a girl from my part-time job.<br /> <br />Even if I interact with them, I know they are just using me. There’s no reason for them to treat me kindly.<br /> <br />But I don’t really care about that. My relationships with them are one of the few things that allow me to feel like I’m having a normal school life.<br /> <br />From them, I was able to learn about the school caste system, intricacies of relationships, and adolescent youth.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I walk home together every day with my childhood friend who I played with until kindergarten, Hanazono Hana.<br /> <br />When I walk home with her, we always have to stop and get a snack. I make sure to pay, reading the situation.<br /> <br />Sometimes I accompany her shopping and carry her bags. Sometimes I go with her to scary movies she can’t watch alone.<br /> <br />On nights when she can’t sleep, I stay on long phone calls with her. I’ve helped tutor her for tests and done homework together.<br /> <br />Even though I was uninterested in romance, through her I was able to understand a little about relationships between men and women.<br /> <br />If I’m not mistaken, she is interested in me. And I’m also attracted to her, I think.<br /> <br />At least that’s how I saw our relationship.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hm, it’s about time.”<br /> <br />I sense the neighboring class’s homeroom ending.<br /> <br />I stop my train of thought and stand up from my seat. I have plans to walk home with my childhood friend Hanazono again today.<br /> <br />The hallways overflow with noisy students. I don’t mind being alone among the commotion. It allows me to feel like I’m living a normal school life.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />As I go to enter the neighboring classroom, I hear voices.<br /> <br />Hanazono was talking with her girl friends.<br /> <br />“Huh, isn’t Hana-chan dating Toudou-kun?”<br /> <br />“And isn’t Hana-chan too cute for him anyway?”<br /> <br />“Yeah he’s so plain. Don’t you think she’s interested in other guys?”<br /> <br />I clearly hear Hanazono’s voice chime in.<br /> <br />“Uh, oh, um, yes! The guy I’m interested in is the basketball club’s Midosuji-senpai! Ah, a guy like him is just a convenient childhood friend I hang out with as a courtesy! He’s just a convenient boy I can use!”<br /> <br />“I knew it-“<br /> <br />“Midosuji-senpai is so cool!”<br /> <br />I knock on the classroom door, knock knock. Then I enter the classroom.<br /> <br />“Excuse me. Hanazono, shall we not walk home today?”<br /> <br />I hear Hanazono’s surprised voice yell “Ehh!?”<br /> <br />The girls stop their conversation.<br /> <br />“Ah–, uh no! I’m coming now. Um, uh, about what I just said–“<br /> <br />“Pfft, your convenient boy is here.”<br /> <br />“Idiot, he can hear you.”<br /> <br />“No way he can hear us.”<br /> <br />–I have good hearing so I heard everything. But I guess I should pretend I didn’t, like a normal student?<br /> <br />“Hey, quiet down…Jeez, I’ll see you guys again tomorrow!”<br /> <br />Hanazono waved goodbye to her friends.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono and I walk home together almost every day. She’s my childhood friend from kindergarten who I reunited with when starting middle school.<br /> <br />Thanks to Hanazono, I was able to learn about school life despite being taciturn and ignorant of common sense.<br /> <br />“Hey, um, did you hear what I said earlier?”<br /> <br />“Earlier? I don’t know.”<br /> <br />Hanazono looked into my face as she asked.<br /> <br />I guess it’s best to pretend I didn’t hear anything inconvenient.<br /> <br />That’s what a convenient boy would do.<br /> <br />And I should hide the fact that I had any feelings for her.<br /> <br />Forget about it. She likes that Midosuji-senpai guy.<br /> <br />…Human relationships sure are complicated. I don’t understand them at all. I was certain Hanazono liked me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Ah, it’s always like this. Just [Reset] the unpleasant things and re-learn.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />We walk in silence. For some reason the air feels heavier than usual.<br /> <br />Hanazono fidgets nervously beside me. It seems like she wants to say something but is hesitating.<br /> <br />Hanazono takes something out of her bag.<br /> <br />“Um, hey, this–“<br /> <br />It was a love letter wrapped in cute packaging.<br /> <br />I see, so a so-called love letter. Indeed, I’m a convenient boy. I have good intuition. Just last week a girl in class asked me to pass a love letter to Samejima-kun.</p>






<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uucjxBG.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>


<p>It must be the same. She wants me to pass it to the upperclassman she has feelings for, Midosuji-senpai.<br /> <br />For just a moment, I feel a pain in my chest.<br /> <br />I don’t understand what kind of pain it is,<br /> <br />because I’ve erased that kind of pain so many times.<br /> <br />Over and over, again and again, I’ve [Reset] and erased the pain from my heart.<br /> <br />Erasing the emotions inside me that cause a painful feeling in my heart.<br /> <br />That’s [Reset].<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I was little I got headaches because I couldn’t [Reset] well, but now I’m fine.<br /> <br />The side effect is my past memories are extremely vague….<br /> <br />But there are still some things left recorded in my head as memories.<br /> <br />I gaze at Hanazono’s face intently, burning it into my mind one last time.<br /> <br />This must have been my first love. Without even understanding feelings of love, I had opened my heart spending time with the cheerful Hanazono.<br /> <br />“W-what’s with that face…”<br /> <br />Hanazono looked away shyly. I can sense the feeling of affection, but it’s not directed at me.<br /> <br />It was aimed at someone else.<br /> <br />My chest tightened. An unpleasant feeling welled up inside me, extremely painful. This is unbearable. I really can’t live a normal life after all. I hate feeling this awful.<br /> <br />So I–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Reset all the feelings I had towards her.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“W-what’s wrong, Tsuyoshi!? Your face is completely pale!”<br /> <br />I stand still, looking up at the sky. My heartbeat returns to normal. My body temperature drops. My heart feels empty. I don’t feel anything anymore.<br /> <br />The memories I shared with Hanazono remain as memories. In an instant, I erased all the [affection] I had slowly developed for Hanazono over many long years.<br /> <br />This isn’t a metaphor or joke. It’s real.<br /> <br />I don’t have any lingering feelings left for Hanazono inside me now at all.<br /> <br />To me now, Hanazono is like a stranger.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Ah, I see. I should pass this to him? I’m often asked to pass things so there’s no problem.”<br /> <br />Hanazono stops walking.<br /> <br />She looks bewildered at my face. My tone of voice must be different than usual.<br /> <br />“Huh? Oh, what are you saying? And your face is so scary…”<br /> <br />“It’s alright. I may be unskilled at personal relationships, but I will do my best.”<br /> <br />Hanazono looks troubled but also embarrassed.<br /> <br />“Hehe…you’ll accept it?”<br /> <br />“Yes, I properly complete requested tasks.”<br /> <br />“Hm? Well, alright~! Let’s keep getting along from now on too!”<br /> <br />“Yes, pardon me, but I will go pass this to Midosuji-senpai right away. Excuse me.”<br /> <br />I run off.<br /> <br />I hear Hanazono’s scream from behind.<br /> <br />“Whaaat!? Ah, you! Wait a minute!”<br /> <br />She must be shy. But it doesn’t concern me anymore.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Because I’ve completely reset all of my feelings of affection for Hanazono–<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />After that day, I stopped walking home with Hanazono.<br /> <br />When I saw Midosuji-senpai’s face as I handed him Hanazono’s love letter, I figured it would work out successfully. He was quite a handsome guy.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />…Human relationships sure are complicated. Back in elementary school all I had to do was study and sports.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />One day, Hanazono barged into my classroom with incredible momentum.<br /> <br />When she spotted me, she glared sharply. Voice shaking, Hanazono said to me:<br /> <br />“Y-y-you! Why did you give the love letter I gave you to Midosuji-senpai! That was for you! Are you stupid!? I-it took a lot of courage to work up! A-and why don’t you walk home with me anymore…you don’t contact me either…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />…What is she talking about? I don’t understand the situation.<br /> <br />“In the classroom, I heard you talking with your friends about how you [like Midosuji-senpai]. And I heard I’m just your convenient childhood friend. So I assumed you asked me to pass it to Midosuji-senpai.”<br /> <br />“Huh!? I never said anything like that to you!! ……Unbelievable. Sniff, sniff, j-just when I thought we could be together…”<br /> <br />“I’m seen as a convenient guy. –Hanazono would suit someone better.”<br /> <br />–I also had feelings her, but I [reset] them. Now, I just see her as a classmate.<br /> <br />Exposed to the curious eyes of our classmates. If this continues, weird rumors about Hanazono might spread.<br /> <br />I bow my head firmly, sincerely apologizing.<br /> <br />“–I see. I’m very sorry. I won’t go near you again. Please accept my sincere apologies…”<br /> <br />“Wha…it was just a misunderstanding so…let’s walk home together again…okay?”<br /> <br />–The same time won’t come back. I can’t cause any more trouble because of my lack of common sense.<br /> <br />“–Understood. If you feel like it, call out to me.”<br /> <br />“Ah….could it be? Don’t tell me you did that Reset thing again…”<br /> <br />Hanazono’s face was pale. An unbridgeable distance between us now.<br /> <br />Ah, human relationships really are so difficult.<br /> </p>


<h3>Chapter 2: Classmate Michiba Rokka</h3>


<p> <br />I was even more socially inept in middle school than I am now.<br /> <br />Thanks to Hanazono being by my side, I was somehow able to get through school life.<br /> <br />My head understands. The memories remain.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[You idiot! That’s not food!]<br /> <br />[Why do you do things like that….I want to play with other kids too…]<br /> <br />[Huh? You’ve never been on a train? You’re kidding, right?]<br /> <br />[Haah, you’re not a little kid anymore so don’t play in the sandbox.]<br /> <br />[Here, I’ll apologize with you…]<br /> <br />[Cheer up! You’re my childhood friend after all. We’ll go eat ice cream on the way home.]<br /> <br />[See, you can smile properly. I was worried over nothing. …Ah, n-not that I was worried or anything!]<br /> <br />I don’t feel any emotion recalling those memories. Because I reset all my emotions.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The classroom is peaceful as usual today.<br /> <br />I don’t dislike this kind of tranquility. At least I don’t have to take tests with weird machines strapped to my head or do exercise until I feel like dying. I love a lukewarm life like this.<br /> <br />The classroom is overflowing with chatter from classmates during break time. Of course I’m not part of it.<br /> <br />“Hey, how’d you do on the test Yamada?”<br /> <br />“Seriously the worst, I totally failed!”<br /> <br />“I’m screwed! And that means I win! You’re treating me to karaoke today.”<br /> <br />“Hah? No way man, you treat me.”<br /> <br />It’s amazing they can get so worked up over tests.<br /> <br />…I want to have normal conversations with my classmates too. My unsociable self can’t take that first step.<br /> <br />Even when I work up the courage to talk to them, I always end up saying something weird….In middle school I failed over and over. Entering high school didn’t change things – when I try talking to classmates an awkward mood still arises. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong.<br /> <br />My classmates happily chat together comparing test papers. It seems so dazzling.<br /> <br />The tests at this school aren’t that hard. I intentionally fill out about half at random and leave the rest blank so I don’t stand out with a high score. So my grades are average.<br /> <br />An ordinary, harmless student with nothing notable about him. That’s how my classmates see me.<br /> </p>



<p>“Yo! Sensei, how’d you do on the test? I bet as usual you didn’t take it seriously, right?”<br /> <br />The class president Michiba Rokka came and talked to me.<br /> <br />She’s the only classmate who talks to me, the friendless one.<br /> <br />We usually only talk in the library, so it’s rare for her to talk to me in the classroom.<br /> <br />In any case, I can feel my heart lift just from her talking to me. This must be the feeling of happiness.<br /> <br />My interactions with Michiba gave me an important reason to feel like I’m living a normal school life.<br /> <br />Michiba casually puts her hand on my shoulder.<br /> <br />The friendly and cheerful Michiba is well-liked by the entire class. And most of the boys in class are tempted by how friendly she is.<br /> <br />I can’t really tell if she’s beautiful or not, but she calls herself the cutest girl in class. That must be true.<br /> <br />I often overhear male classmates say [That girl totally likes me].<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Sorry, I’m taking it seriously. …I just lack effort.”<br /> <br />“Pfft, as if. You’re definitely a genius. Hey, so, like, let’s go to class karaoke today! You’re always alone, so it’ll be good to go occasionally, right!”<br /> <br />Like other classmates, I often find myself perplexed by the closeness in Michiba’s attitude.</p>





<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f06AMw0.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Before, when Michiba was studying alone in the library during lunch break, I couldn’t stand it and ended up giving her advice on studying.<br /> <br />Since then, teaching Michiba became a daily routine for me.<br /> <br />According to Michiba, “[Toudou’s way of teaching is really easy to understand!]” is what she said.<br /> </p>



<p>In reality, Michiba improved to the top-level grades in the class. Study sessions still continue.<br /> <br />…Since there are hardly any students who go to the library during lunch break, no one knows about it.<br /> <br />Being with Michiba was bright and enjoyable. I knew that I was considered a convenient guy for teaching her, or so they said behind my back.<br /> <br />Even so, Michiba would engage in conversation with awkward me. Just that made me feel favorable as a classmate.<br /> <br />“Karaoke, huh… I’ll handle it.”<br /> <br />“Haha, ‘handle it’? You’re not an old man, you know. Oh, by the way, did you break up with Hanazono?”<br /> <br />“Why would that happen? We weren’t dating in the first place. Rather, she and I are just childhood friends. Nothing more nothing less.”<br /> <br />After a puzzled moment, Michiba smiled.<br /> <br />“Hmm, then, how about this. Hey, about karaoke… how about going together, just the two of us?”<br /> <br />“No, I’ll pass.”<br /> <br />Michiba is an important classmate. It would be troublesome if she misunderstood things. Even though I have favorable feelings, it’s only as classmates, not romantic.<br /> <br />“–Huh, ‘I’ll pass.’ That quick response is annoying… hey, if you don’t want to be alone with me, come with us after school today. If you don’t come, I won’t talk to you anymore, okay?<br /> <br />Hmm, being asked like that is troubling.<br /> <br />“I understand. I’ve never been to karaoke so I’m nervous.”<br /> <br />“Ahaha, it’ll be fine! You’ll definitely get along better with our classmates! So after school, ‘kay? I’ll contact you later!”<br /> <br />In the end, I was forcibly invited by Michiba to go to karaoke.<br /> <br />Going to karaoke with classmates after tests. I felt an emotion of my heart bouncing.<br /> <br />I was looking forward to it a little bit.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />Today was Saturday. After going home first, we were to meet in front of the karaoke box in the shopping district.<br /> <br />I decided to dress up more than usual and headed to the meeting spot.<br /> <br />I tidy my messy hair and change into going-out clothes.<br /> <br />Come to think of it, these clothes were picked out by Hanazono.<br /> <br />[You have no fashion sense!? Even if it’s not a date–no wait, it’s not a date, but when going out with a girl shouldn’t you not wear your school jersey!]<br /> <br />I was scolded like that. That day she ended up picking out clothes for me.<br /> <br />…Why am I recalling that day? I should have erased my feelings.<br /> <br />[Hmm, with your build these clothes suit you. N-not that I think you look cool or anything!]<br /> <br />What was I feeling back then?<br /> <br />Nothing comes to mind. It’s like watching a stranger’s memories.<br /> <br />My heart won’t hurt anymore.<br /> <br />–So it’s fine.<br /> <br />I switched my thoughts to karaoke and headed out.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I arrived at the meeting spot, it seemed I was early as no one else was there yet.<br /> <br />I decided to wait while observing my surroundings.<br /> <br />Since it was a karaoke place in the city center, the passersby were dressed in various styles.<br /> <br />For some reason a lot of people were glancing my way. I don’t really like when strangers look at me. But I’m looking at them too so it’s mutual.<br /> <br />The meeting time had long passed.<br /> <br />After observing people for a while, I was playing with a cat that had sidled up to my feet.<br /> <br />I pet the cat’s head. Animals are easy to interact with. There’s no risk of messing up communication.<br /> <br />“You’re alone too, huh?”<br /> <br />“Meow~”<br /> <br />“Hmm, unfortunately I don’t have any food. Sorry.”<br /> <br />From a short distance away, a different cat meowed. The cat I was petting reacted to the meow and went over to the other cat.<br /> <br />I was alone again.<br /> <br />“…It’s nice to have friends.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />No matter how long I waited, Michiba and the others never came.<br /> <br />After around two hours probably? Waiting alone is very lonely.<br /> <br />Did I get the time wrong? The place? I start feeling anxious.<br /> <br />–There’s no way I made a mistake. When I was told the time and place I immediately took notes.<br /> <br />“…Maybe I should head home?”<br /> <br />I must have made some kind of mistake. I’ll apologize to Michiba tomorrow. As I turned to head home, my smartphone loudly rang. It was a call from Michiba.<br /> <br />“Hello–“<br /> <br />“Ahh! Toudou! You went to the wrong place!! Jeez, it can’t be helped I guess. Hurry up and come here! Everyone’s waiting!”<br /> <br />The call ended. She told me a different place than my notes said.<br /> <br />…Is this a prank? Or did I make a mistake? …Either way, I need to go for smooth interactions with Michiba in class.<br /> <br />In any case, I headed to the place Michiba specified.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Arriving at the karaoke place, I entered the box she specified–inside were two male and female high schoolers I didn’t recognize, looking unfriendly and punk-like.<br /> <br />No sign of Michiba or my classmates anywhere. I’m sure I have the right room number. Perplexed, it shows on my face.<br /> <br />“The hell you lookin’ at!? Get out, wrong room!”<br /> <br />“Oh wait, Toudou? What’re you doing here? Hey, go grab some juice from the drink bar!”<br /> <br />“Huh, you know Haru?”<br /> <br />“Know her? We work together. Ah well, who cares. Tsuyoshi get some juice, juice!”<br /> <br />“Tch, then you go get it.”<br /> <br />…I have things I want to say, but for smooth interactions I decided to just go grab juice without arguing for now. Arguing would just be a pain.<br /> <br />I wander around the unfamiliar karaoke place and arrive at the juice bar.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The girl with heavy makeup there is my coworker Tanaka Haru.<br /> <br />Tanaka is my supervisor at my part-time job.<br /> <br />We go to the same school but have never talked at school.<br /> <br />Despite her gal-like appearance, she’s a very kind girl who always covers for me when I make mistakes at work.<br /> <br />Sometimes we walk home together when our shifts end at the same time. She listened when I was having trouble with Hanazono. She’s the only one who properly listens to what I say.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />…I froze in front of the juice bar.<br /> <br />I don’t know how to use this machine. Is it okay to just press buttons as I want?<br /> <br />The staff member who was serving saw me, but ignored me and disappeared to the back…. Hmm…. I need to complete the task asked of me and meet up with Michiba.<br /> <br />“Ah, looks like you didn’t know how to use it after all! Ahaha, my bad.”<br /> <br />“Tanaka?”<br /> <br />Tanaka was next to me. A soft, sweet scent drifted from her. It’s not an unpleasant smell. Very calming.<br /> <br />With a cheerful expression like at work, Tanaka started explaining to me.<br /> <br />“So, you take a glass, choose a drink you like, and just press the button!”<br /> <br />“I see, so I can just use it as I want. What a convenient machine.”<br /> <br />“Wait, have you never used one before? They’re at family restaurants too.”<br /> <br />“Is that so? I’ve never been to a family restaurant.”<br /> <br />“Huhhh!? Never!? Hey, let’s go together next time!”<br /> <br />“Uh, that’s…”<br /> <br />“If you don’t wanna it’s fine. Here, press this!”<br /> <br />“Oh, okay.”<br /> <br />I place a glass and press the button. I see, it’s simple enough a child could do it. The glass fills with carbonated juice.<br /> <br />Somehow, I felt like the unpleasant feelings floating inside me popped away like the bubbles.<br /> <br />“Alright, let’s head back!”<br /> <br />“Um, I…”<br /> <br />For now I followed behind Tanaka holding the juice.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When we returned to the room and I put the two juices on the table, Tanaka sitting on the sofa slapped the spot next to her. Her male friend looked at me too.<br /> <br />“Come on, Toudou join us for karaoke!”<br /> <br />“Hm? Rare to see Haru take a liking to someone. I’m cool with anything if it’s fine with her.”<br /> <br />Bu-but, Tanaka should be here on a date. I’d be a third wheel. Plus I have plans with Michiba.<br /> <br />“Sorry, I was invited by Michiba so I can’t join you for karaoke.”<br /> <br />“Aw really? That’s too bad but it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />I wonder if she’ll invite me again?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I want to tell Tanaka I’d like to come with her next time, but I can’t find the right words.<br /> <br />“Thanks Toudou! See you at work!”<br /> <br />“Tch, thanks. We’ll have fun without ya.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="../Images/0008_ZNDc8dm.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>The unpleasant guy takes some candy from his pocket and hands it to me.<br /> <br />…What is this? I sense something odd from him. He looks normal but his movements are efficient, no waste.<br /> <br />“Ah, thank you. I like candy so this makes me happy. Well then, excuse me. T-Tanaka, see you…next time.”<br /> <br />Tanaka waves energetically seeing me off. For some reason I’m filled with embarrassment.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I switch gears to search for Michiba and the others. Michiba isn’t in any of the boxes I check.<br /> <br />…Just when I thought I could interact with my classmates.<br /> <br />I’m bad at talking and poor at interpersonal skills.<br /> <br />Even when invited to karaoke, I hesitate thinking “Is it okay for someone like me to go?” and end up declining a lot.<br /> <br />I thought if it was through Michiba I could talk with my classmates, but they’ve probably already gone home.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I wanted to experience karaoke…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I decided to leave the karaoke place. As I dejectedly walked out, I saw my classmates and Michiba in front of the karaoke shop.<br /> <br />They were pointing at me and laughing. Not a kind laughter. It was the unpleasant laugh I’ve experienced many times, ridiculing someone.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Why?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“That guy totally fell for it. No way we’d invite a gloomy loner.”<br /> <br />“I mean, who’d go singing with someone you barely talk to?”<br /> <br />“Can’t believe he seriously waited two hours, you good?”<br /> <br />“….Was he always that type? Kinda different image in normal clothes…”<br /> <br />“It’s fine, he’s definitely into me… Heheh.”<br /> <br />“Rokka-san’s so popular!”<br /> <br />They think I can’t hear since they’re whispering.<br /> <br />But I have good hearing. And I’ve mastered lip reading. I hear them clearly.<br /> <br />–I…just wanted to go to karaoke with normal classmates. So I was really happy when Michiba invited me.<br /> <br />But in the end I just got made a fool of?<br /> <br />The warm feelings I held for Michiba as a classmate–<br /> <br />After the nice exchange with Tanaka earlier, my heart rapidly withers.<br /> <br />What I feel from them is malice. Harmless malice. They probably think it’s just a joke. I was never taught about this kind of thing at school.<br /> <br />The library with Michiba. The fun study sessions we had. Michiba reporting her test scores went up with a smile.<br /> <br />She was always bright and worried about me being alone.<br /> <br />An important classmate.<br /> <br />But to her I’m just a convenient boy who teaches her.<br /> <br />My chest hurts.<br /> <br />I thought I had made my first friend besides my childhood friend.<br /> <br />When we exchanged contact info on a messaging app, I was happy.<br /> <br />The meaningless chatter made me feel like I had a normal daily life.<br /> <br />If it hurts this much, I should just forget it all.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Reset.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />If I reset it as if it never happened, my heart won’t hurt.<br /> <br />I look up at the sky and concentrate my mind.<br /> <br />Switching gears mentally. Literally switching emotions.<br /> <br />I can let the malice from unimportant people wash over me. But malice from important people is sorrowful.<br /> <br />I rapidly recall all my memories with Michiba, ignoring the pain in my chest.<br /> <br />Condense all the emotions I felt interacting with Michiba.<br /> <br />And completely shatter that condensed essence.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I reset my entire relationship with Michiba.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The pain deep in my chest disappears instantly, and I return to a flat mental state.<br /> <br />Reset all affection to zero.<br /> <br />This isn’t a metaphor. I can completely erase affection, memories, and emotion.<br /> <br />I won’t mistakenly erase memories like when I was a kid and messed up resetting.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Now then, I’ll stop by the supermarket on the way home and buy ingredients for dinner and tomorrow’s bento. I’ll make curry today.<br /> <br />Michiba and the others run up to me giggling.<br /> <br />“Haha, Sensei! It was just a joke. Come on, let’s go to the next karaoke place! We just wanted to test you. Oh, yeah, will you teach everyone else too? If I tell them your grades secret they’ll be eager to learn– “<br /> <br />“Yeah, let’s go!”<br /> <br />“Michiba told us, right? You’re actually smart!”<br /> <br />“Let’s do karaoke!”<br /> <br />I feel no warmth at all.<br /> <br />I don’t need this kind of stupid friendship.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–Excuse me, I’m going home.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Just then, Tanaka came out of the shop. Her face looked refreshed, like she relieved stress by singing. She waves when she sees me. I wave back. Seeing that, Tanaka looks satisfied and leaves with the guy somewhere.<br /> </p>



<p>Michiba had a stunned look on her face.<br /> </p>



<p>“Uh, huh? W-Why? Are you mad? I-It was just a joke, you know? Come on, Sensei, teach me, please?”<br /> <br />“Sorry. I won’t have anything to do with you anymore.”<br /> <br />“W-Wait a minute! Everyone gathered for your sake, you know! Hey, read the room…”<br /> <br />Reading the room. A crucial skill for modern high school students. It seems my grades are at the bottom.<br /> <br />“Oh, it’s my fault for leaving without considering your circumstances… I sincerely apologize. Excuse me, Michiba.”<br /> <br />“A- Toudou! Wait a moment!! I-I apologize, okay!”<br /> <br />People tend to get carried away.<br /> <br />It can’t be helped. We’re still high school students. We’ve only lived for seventeen years.<br /> <br />That’s why we don’t hesitate to hurt others. Because we don’t truly understand how much it hurts.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Even when apologizing, I know it’s just because they want me to teach them.<br /> <br />I’m just a convenient guy for Michiba. I’ve already reset that relationship.<br /> <br />“You don’t need to apologize. I don’t feel anything even if you say that.”<br /> <br />“Wha, why’re you being so cold…You liked me, right!? That’s why you taught me, right!”<br /> <br />“Sorry, I don’t understand what you mean. When I look at you I feel nothing.”<br /> <br />“S-Sensei, your face, it’s scary…”<br /> <br />“Please don’t call me that.”<br /> <br />Michiba looks shocked hearing my words.<br /> <br />But I don’t feel anything seeing her make that face. My heart won’t hurt anymore. Because I’ve reset all my feelings for Michiba.<br /> <br />Any more interaction is meaningless.<br /> <br />I start walking, ignoring Michiba.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My mind is occupied with making a grocery list for dinner.<br /> </p>



<p>I suddenly remember the candy in my pocket. I put the candy in my mouth. It’s sweet but for some reason I taste saltiness…</p>



<h3>Chapter 3: Kind Tanaka</h3>



<p> <br />Meals during elementary school were inorganic. The taste was whatever. Just filling my stomach while getting nutrients. Any deficiencies were supplemented with pills. I recall eating alone in the classroom.<br /> <br />By then I had already lost my memories of kindergarten.<br /> <br />I didn’t learn the concept of friends until starting middle school.<br /> <br />So I was really happy when I first made friends.<br /> <br />Eating bento secretly together with Michiba in the library, for some reason it tasted more delicious than usual to me.<br /> <br />–Those feelings are already gone now.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />Lunch break.<br /> <br />I’m eating my bento alone. A homemade bento. Plum rice, chicken sashimi, and overcooked broccoli – the taste wasn’t great but it turned out well.<br /> <br />Any deficient nutrients can be supplemented with pills. My cooking skills have improved little by little. I’ll try adding one more dish tomorrow.<br /> <br />Unlike in elementary school, my classmates are in the classroom with me now.<br /> <br />Just hearing the voices around me makes my heart bloom.<br /> <br />But I’m still the only one eating bento alone…it felt a little lonely.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hey, you took my fried chicken!”<br /> <br />“Shut up, your mom’s fried chicken is delicious!”<br /> <br />“Then give me your shrimp fry!”<br /> <br />“Fine, here. Oh yeah, did you do the homework? I didn’t, lemme copy.”<br /> <br />“Buy me a doughnut later.”<br /> <br />“Nice, let’s go buy some after eating!”<br /> <br />Everyone is happily eating gathered around their friends’ desks.<br /> <br />The class was clearly divided into cliques. I’m the only loner.<br /> <br />Luckily there are no bullies in this class.<br /> </p>



<p>There’s the gamer/anime group, the quiet good student group, the active sports guys, and the socially aware cool kids group. More nuanced divisions exist but that’s the gist.<br /> <br />…Michiba-san is looking over here. She belongs to the group of people with fulfilling relationships. She’s surrounded by friends, eating lunch together. I feel glances from her since the morning. She shows signs of wanting to start a conversation with me, but I don’t feel like talking.<br /> <br />My relationship with her is gone. I don’t want to hurt by interacting with her again.<br /> <br />I know. This is just me being childish and selfish, relying on resetting. It shows my heart is weak.<br /> <br />When I finished eating my bento, I realized my lunchtime routine had disappeared.<br /> <br />With no more connection to Michiba, I have no need to go to the library.<br /> <br />I see, habits can form through connections between people.<br /> <br />I now have free time after this.<br /> <br />Now then, what to do…<br /> <br />Just as I started to stand from my seat–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Is Tsuyoshi here today? — Oh, Toudou. Ah, there you are!”<br /> <br />Hanazono came over to me.<br /> <br />If Hanazono talks to me I’ll respond, but right now I’m not in the mood.<br /> <br />Plus I’ve caused Hanazono trouble so I shouldn’t talk to her, or strange rumors might spread about her…<br /> <br />“Sorry, I’m about to–“<br /> <br />“Wait! Tsuyoshi, you stopped your study sessions with Michiba right? I heard the rumors. You don’t have plans after this right? Come hang out with me a bit!”<br /> <br />I was surprised. I thought nobody knew about my study sessions with Michiba in the library.<br /> <br />To think Hanazono knew…<br /> <br />Just as I tried to reply, Michiba came this way.<br /> <br />“You, the girl who got dumped by Sensei…I mean, Toudou…that’s Hanazono right? Haha, so clingy. I mean, we’re doing a study session now!”<br /> <br />–I don’t have any desire for that anymore. The feelings I had for Michiba as a friend are gone, reset and disappeared. Why can’t Michiba understand that? I guess it’s only natural since normal people can’t erase their emotions.<br /> <br />“Huh? Weren’t you the one who tricked and made fun of Tsuyoshi!? I can’t forgive someone like that!”<br /> <br />“I-it was just a little joke! Not like you stirring up weird romantic drama! –Hmph, at least I’m more mature than a stupid girl who says the name of a guy she doesn’t even like!”<br /> <br />“Why you–! This devious woman!”<br /> <br />“What’d you say! Liar!”<br /> <br />–I slipped out of the classroom without a trace. They’re talking about me but it feels like someone else’s business. I don’t want to get involved in troublesome stuff.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I wandered the school aimlessly. Come to think of it, I haven’t grown at all from middle school to high school. Still shy with strangers and bad at talking, without any friends.<br /> <br />The only one always beside me looking troubled is Hanazono.<br /> <br />I want to live a normal life. I don’t need to be the most popular guy in class. I don’t want to stand out. I just want a peaceful life.<br /> <br />Can I live normally? Or am I strange after all?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />While walking I ended up in the courtyard. Students who finished lunch are chatting. It’s a popular spot with lots of greenery and feels nice in the sunlight.<br /> <br />I saw an empty bench and decided to kill time sitting there, counting the flowers in the garden.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hey! It’s you, Toudou! Thanks for the juice the other day! “<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka Haru suddenly sat next to me.<br /> <br />I shift half a step away. I get nervous when girls besides Hanazono sit next to me.<br /> <br />Tanaka goes to the same school but she’s in a special class in a different building, so we rarely cross paths.<br /> <br />The blonde gal Tanaka has lots of curly clip-on hair pieces on her head. I think they’re called…ex…something.<br /> <br />She has a flashy appearance but is a very kind girl, supporting me when I’m not used to working my part-time job.<br /> <br />Our conversation at karaoke the other day was meaningful. Despite her looks, Tanaka is level-headed. When I tried to treat her to juice she got mad at me.<br /> <br />I first met Tanaka on my first day working my part-time job.<br /> <br />I had plenty of savings but chose to get a job to learn social skills.<br /> <br />When we first met, Tanaka was very cold.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />[Huh? New part-timer? Oh, I see.]<br /> <br />[What? I have to look after him? Ugh…]<br /> <br />[Don’t get too familiar with me. We just have a work relationship.]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I just focused on my work.<br /> <br />And I realized something. Groups existed at my workplace too. None of the staff tried talking to me. Besides the chef, no one taught me what to do when I didn’t understand something.<br /> <br />Despite so many people around, I was alone. The workplace formed its own little society.<br /> <br />Sometimes I would make mistakes unlike normal people. I knew they called me “weird in the head” and laughed at me behind my back.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Ah geez, you do it like this.]<br /> <br />[Hey, why Toudou is doing your job!? Cut that out, ‘kay?]<br /> <br />[Oh…it’s raining. We don’t have spare umbrellas at the shop…Hm? You’ll let me borrow yours? W-wait! Your umbrella!?]<br /> <br />[And Toudou’s unexpectedly funny y’know. Like, totally uninterested in girls right? I can tell with my woman’s intuition. Kinda like a little brother.]<br /> <br />[Here, let’s take the trash out quick so we can leave faster! Let’s get juice on the way home!]<br /> <br />[Hmm, your childhood friend Hanazono-san, right? Hey, tell me more details, that’s totally a date!]<br /> <br />I don’t know what triggered it, but Tanaka started talking to me normally at work. I still can’t talk with the other staff.<br /> <br />There were many times I considered quitting the part-time job, but I kept at it because I could see Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I rapidly recall memories of Tanaka. Yes, she’s a girl I have good feelings about.<br /> <br />“Oh, Tanaka. Hello.”<br /> <br />“As dull as ever…But hey, you had friends to go to karaoke with Toudou? Did you have fun last weekend?”<br /> <br />I try recalling what happened on the weekend…<br /> <br />That’s already irrelevant to me now. I erased those emotions so I no longer remember them.<br /> <br />The only fact is that I didn’t get to do karaoke.<br /> <br />“No, I don’t remember.”<br /> <br />“You don’t remember? Huh, I don’t get it.”<br /> <br />“S-sorry. I don’t know how to explain it. I went to the karaoke place but didn’t actually sing karaoke.”<br /> <br />“Huh? What do you mean? And Toudou, you look down. Tell me what’s up! I heard rumors you’re on weird terms with your childhood friend now too?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, Hanazono doesn’t matter anymore.”<br /> <br />“…That’s no good. I mean, you used to happily tell me a lot about Hanazono right?”<br /> <br />Tanaka stares at me intently.<br /> <br />It’s a serious expression. The atmosphere is completely different from just a moment ago. I unintentionally got captivated. Her eyes were truly beautiful.<br /> <br />Maybe it’s okay to talk to Tanaka.<br /> <br />“Well, actually–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I briefly explained to Tanaka. Trying to be as objective as possible, eliminating emotions. I wanted to convey the information accurately without my subjectivity interfering.<br /> <br />Tanaka, without interrupting my story, listens while nodding.<br /> <br />After hearing the story, Tanaka opens her closed eyes and lightly taps my head.<br /> <br />“–Ouch, Tanaka.”<br /> <br />“Even though you finally became friends, you shouldn’t just cut it off so easily… It’s lonely, you know.”<br /> <br />“But I don’t want my own heart to hurt. That’s why I [reset].”<br /> <br />“You can’t just reset your emotions. You’re just deceiving yourself.”<br /> <br />“Well, this is…”<br /> <br />“I didn’t know about Michiba-san, but you’ve been friends with Hanazono-san for a long time, right? Let’s make up.”<br /> <br />“But I already said it was my fault–“<br /> <br />“No, that’s not the point. This is something you could’ve resolved by talking it out right? Is it that big of a deal you have to completely cut ties…? Severing all relationships is lonely, for you…”<br /> <br />I’m…lonely?<br /> <br />At that time, I couldn’t leave my hurt heart as it was.<br /> <br />So I–reset my heart. Completely zeroed out all the relationships I had built up.<br /> <br />That way my heart won’t hurt. Things will go back to normal.<br /> <br />As I stay silent, Tanaka stands up and stretches.<br /> <br />“Well, I get how you feel. Everyone’s selfish…That’s why some people don’t like me, they say I make enemies easily. So like, at times like that, I let it slide off me.”<br /> <br />“Let it slide off…can I do something that skillful?”<br /> <br />“How should I know? I’m talking about me.”<br /> <br />I gaze intently at Tanaka.<br /> <br />Like I thought even at work, Tanaka is mature.<br /> <br />Her looks and inner self don’t match — it’s shocking.<br /> <br />I’m moved by Tanaka’s words.<br /> <br />“W-why’re you staring at me like that!? It’s embarrassing, ‘kay! Toudou’s plain but high quality. Discerning people will know! …Ah, I ended up saying something weird while caught up in the moment. You’re treating me to juice next time!”<br /> <br />“–Understood.”<br /> <br />“Idiot! At times like this you’re supposed to think more before answering! …Well, just stay as you are Toudou…See you!”<br /> <br />Tanaka turns her back to me. Looks like the conversation is over.<br /> <br />–I see, then.<br /> <br />“Um, thank you, Tanaka. So, I found this cafe with delicious juice, and next time, as thanks, would you…would you like to go together…?”<br /> <br />The words get stuck and I can’t speak smoothly…My face must be flushed from embarrassment…But still I force the words out.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Will you go with me, please? “<br /> </p>



<p> <br />With gratitude–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka who had her back turned looks my way.<br /> <br />Hands on her hips, chest thrust forward. Her healthy skin looks beautiful in the light.<br /> <br />With a big smile–she winks and makes a peace sign at me.<br /> <br />“Ahaha! Of course! I’ll wait for you to contact me!”<br /> <br />Tanaka runs off looking happy.<br /> <br />I feel my body growing hot.</p>





<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/H9EazmW.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>


<p>It didn’t disappear even after Tanaka left.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I thought I don’t want to reset this warm feeling.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />But at the same time, I understand this feeling can hurt my heart,<br /> <br />since I believe affection will one day disappear. I know feelings of affection generate pain in my chest.</p>


<h3>Chapter 4: The Leather Shoes I Can&#8217;t Throw Away</h3>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Lunch break was ending and I returned to the classroom, but Hanazono was already gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Michiba is chatting with her friends. She glances my way then looks away, having lost interest.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Huh? Rokka, you&#8217;re done with Toudou-kun? I thought you were kinda obsessed with him?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Hm? Oh, I&#8217;m over it. I didn&#8217;t think he wouldn&#8217;t get that joke at all. Hey, listen, that guy, on Saturday&#8211;&#8220;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Ah, ahaha, Rokka-chan you do some crazy stuff.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Well, I was totally certain he liked me. Though he was just someone who taught me stuff. When he talks he only says [I&#8217;ll take care of it] [Oh, I see] right? But when it&#8217;s studying or stuff he&#8217;s good at he&#8217;ll chatter on and on&#8211;&#8220;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;U-um, Rokka-chan…Toudou-kun is in the classroom already…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I know. We&#8217;re done right? Not like that lying girl, I&#8217;m not interested in gloomy loners. And it&#8217;s not like he can hear us.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I reset my feelings for Michiba.<br>&nbsp;<br>So no matter what she says, my heart won&#8217;t hurt. Actually I think Tanaka was right.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was just throwing a tantrum like a kid. Maybe I should&#8217;ve handled it better.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>But still, at that time I couldn&#8217;t tolerate Michiba and my classmates&#8217; actions.<br>&nbsp;<br>To think I should tolerate being treated like that just because it&#8217;s human relationships…<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;Alright, I&#8217;ll regain my composure and focus on class. Though there&#8217;s no point in being taught things I already know. I decided to properly think about how I can get along with my classmates.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, the last class finished without me coming up with any good ideas.<br>&nbsp;<br>The teacher leaves the classroom after the final homeroom session ends, and my classmates immediately start making noise.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Yo, club today?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Nice! Let&#8217;s go to the game center!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Hey, wanna stop by McD&#8217;s? Tests are done after all.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Part-time job, part-time job!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;You read that manga? It&#8217;s so good! You don&#8217;t have it!? I&#8217;ll lend it to you!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone looks like they&#8217;re having fun. …Just watching them is enough to put me in a good mood.<br>&nbsp;<br>In middle school I learned that when I try to join them, I can sense the atmosphere getting disrupted. Their gazes scared me&#8211;I didn&#8217;t know what to talk about.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite being physically close…it felt so distant.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211;That was a wall.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Also, I have no hobbies. I don&#8217;t play games or listen to music. I&#8217;ve barely read any manga or novels. When I go home I just exercise or study.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nothing in common to talk about.<br>&nbsp;<br>I recall Tanaka from lunch.<br>&nbsp;<br>…Maybe I need to try more varied experiences. But how would that help me get along with them? My classmates use polite language when talking to me. Michiba was the only one who talked to me normally.<br>&nbsp;<br>How did I become friends with Tanaka and Hanazono? It&#8217;s a mystery even to myself…<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>But is it necessary for me to get along with everyone? I have no issues living alone. Thinking about it makes me feel a little lonely though.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know, the way I am now isn&#8217;t good. I need to improve little by little. I don&#8217;t need to become one of the socially successful kids in class. Just aim for normal.<br>&nbsp;<br>While the class boisterously chatters, I leave the classroom.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Exiting the classroom…I see Hanazono&#8217;s back as she walks down the hallway with her friends.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hanazono is happily chatting with her friends. Her back gets further and further away.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211;A convenient boy, huh…<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s thanks to Hanazono that I&#8217;ve been able to live a normal school life without being bullied. But I erased my feelings for her instantly.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t regret it. Once erased, feelings don&#8217;t return.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Senpaaaaai! Toudou-senpaaai! Can you hear meeee!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>As I changed from indoor shoes to loafers and tried to exit the building to the courtyard, I ran into an underclassman acquaintance, Sasami Mimi.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Oh, Sasami. Energetic as always.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Yes sir! Of course! I&#8217;ll give it my all at club today too! Our tournament is coming up after all. Hehe, thanks to you senpai, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll win the next meet!&#8221;</p>






<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Xs94vB.jpg" alt=""/></figure>


<p>Sasami is in the track and field club.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#8217;s a girl I met while jogging in the mornings. When I passed Sasami who was running ahead of me, she got fired up and started chasing after me. At the time I paid her no mind and just kept running through my daily jogging routine. When I finished, Sasami came up to me out of breath and said:<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>[How can you run so fast!? Are you in the track club? That jersey is from that high school right? Mimi is planning to take the exam for that school too! Senpai, your form is amazing and…you&#8217;re not even out of breath! Are you a monster!?]<br>&nbsp;<br>[…I&#8217;m not in any clubs. This is just my daily jogging routine.]<br>&nbsp;<br>[No way, that speed is insane! …Um, I&#8217;m going to keep doing track in high school, so would you maybe run together with me again sometime? Please become Mimi&#8217;s coach!]<br>&nbsp;<br>[Well, I don&#8217;t mind that. ……]<br>&nbsp;<br>And that&#8217;s how my relationship with my underclassman Sasami began.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in reality it was just simply running together. After finishing running, I would check her form and muscle use, and help put together her training regimen.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I felt like I had gained a little sister.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami was always energetic and doing her best, it was cute. When she succeeded in getting into high school, I gave her a small present. It was the brand of athletic shoes she had wanted.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once in high school, Sasami steadily improved, and as a first year was able to qualify for competitions.<br>&nbsp;<br>I felt truly happy for her as if it were my own accomplishment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami, true to her simple desires, had no reservations with me her senior. Her passion for track and field was genuine.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;You have club now right? Don&#8217;t overwork yourself.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Ehehe, I know! Oh, senpai, will you come watch the meet? I&#8217;d be happy if you came!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of it…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;What kind of response is that! Please make sure to come watch!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Sasami and I converse while walking through the courtyard.<br>&nbsp;<br>Normal everyday student life. Just that feels special to me.<br>&nbsp;<br>My schedule fills up. For some reason I feel happy. Sasami will surely be able to win. She works so hard practicing after all.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly, looking ahead I see a male student in jersey clothes coming this way.<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s looking at Sasami. If I remember right, he&#8217;s…<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Yo, Sasami, what&#8217;re you doing here? Hurry up and get to club.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>The one who called out to Sasami is Shimizu Hakkei from the class next to mine. The track team ace, a handsome guy with lots of friends who&#8217;s easy to talk to, he&#8217;s a true socially successful person.<br>&nbsp;<br>I honestly think that&#8217;s amazing. People skilled at interpersonal communication are deserving of respect.<br>&nbsp;<br>For some reason Sasami looks flustered being addressed by him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;S-Shimizu-senpai!? Y-yes, I&#8217;ll go now!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami&#8217;s face is bright red.<br>&nbsp;<br>I may not be able to read the atmosphere, but I&#8217;m observant.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I see, so Sasami likes him. I should leave this place for now…<br>&nbsp;<br>Seeing Sasami look happy, I feel happy too. I want Sasami to find happiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>I signal Sasami with my eyes that I&#8217;m going to leave, but Shimizu addresses me instead. For some reason his eyes are filled with anger.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;&#8211;You&#8217;re Toudou right. …Sorry for the suddenness at our first meeting, but why did you hurt Hana-san? I can&#8217;t forgive you.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;I don&#8217;t understand what he&#8217;s talking about. We&#8217;re meeting for the first time. Why do I have to explain about Hanazono to him? Isn&#8217;t he supposed to be a nice guy? What&#8217;s with this hostility?<br>&nbsp;<br>My head spins in confusion. I don&#8217;t know how to respond.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Toudou, are you listening? I&#8217;m angry. Seeing Hana-san with such a sad face… Damn… By the way, what are you doing with our club member? Hey, Sasami what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>More than anger, I feel malice from Shimizu.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why must I be hated over Hanazono-san?<br>&nbsp;<br>He&#8217;s an outsider right? Could he be…<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Does Shimizu like Hanazono-san?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;W-what are you saying!? O-I don&#8217;t see Hana-san that way! Don&#8217;t make fun of me! You bastard, are you looking down on me!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;N-no, I didn&#8217;t mean that&#8211;&#8220;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Who do you think you are? Making Hana-san cry… And you can&#8217;t even use polite language to someone you just met?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;W-what do you mean? Shimizu and I are in the same grade, we have an equal relationship. I don&#8217;t understand…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Shut up, be quiet.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;I see, he must be a good guy after all. Only nice to his friends he thinks of as such. He shows me no mercy as his enemy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;S-senpai! Let&#8217;s go to club! Here, if we run&#8211;&#8220;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I asked what is he to you, Sasami? An acquaintance? Or could it be, your lover?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;No no no no, you&#8217;re wrong! He just&#8211;!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami is crazy about Shimizu-kun. It&#8217;s really obvious. Seeing such pure affection makes me feel the youth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br>I wanted to leave for Sasami&#8217;s sake. But Shimizu won&#8217;t stop.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;He&#8217;s just what? To be honest, I&#8217;d be disappointed if a club member was acquainted with such an unpleasant guy.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami looks at me for an instant&#8211;and sighs.<br>&nbsp;<br>She has an expression like one of resignation. I&#8217;ve seen that face before. The face people make when discarding something.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#8217;ve seen it many times. And each time, I reset.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;…Haa…Yes! I don&#8217;t know this person at all! He just called out to me a bit! I-I only have eyes for Shimizu-senpai!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Each of Sasami&#8217;s words pierces my chest.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it can&#8217;t be helped. Sasami is in the track club, this guy is the team ace and upperclassman. Power dynamics in small groups are difficult. Let alone for a first year like Sasami, it would be bad if she was disliked by Shimizu.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami must have thought saying this would defuse the situation.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I should endure. I know those aren&#8217;t Sasami&#8217;s true feelings. I recall Tanaka&#8217;s words. Let it slide off me.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;A-and he was bothering me lately! Following me to morning practice too, it was super creepy!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;What!? Should I report him to the police!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;No no no no, thanks to Shimizu-senpai I&#8217;m fine now! Here, Shimizu-senpai let&#8217;s go! I&#8217;ll definitely win the next meet! Hehe…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami with a forced smile takes Shimizu&#8217;s arm and tries to leave, pulling him away from me. All I could do was watch.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Sasami says something to Shimizu and comes back to me.<br>&nbsp;<br>With a complicated expression, Sasami stands before me.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I&#8217;m…I&#8217;m sorry. But I didn&#8217;t know senpai was disliked by Shimizu-senpai. You should have told me. It&#8217;s a little irritating. My reputation with him will drop.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Sasami…?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;And senpai, did you make a girl cry? That&#8217;s the worst.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;What are you saying…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami&#8217;s voice, unlike earlier, was low, dark, and held an unpleasant tone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seeing her change like this, I&#8217;m bewildered and can&#8217;t find any words. Then, Sasami says loudly enough for Shimizu to hear:<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;&#8211;Please don&#8217;t get close to me again!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;Sorry, Tanaka. Letting things slide off me is difficult…Teach me how sometime.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I tightly clench my fist, trying to endure the pain in my chest. I grit my teeth, trying to bear something. But the physical pain doesn&#8217;t suppress it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lowering my eyes, I see my tattered leather shoes.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>The leather shoes I bought with Sasami on a day off.<br>&nbsp;<br>[Senpai, you go to school wearing those shoes with holes?]<br>&nbsp;<br>[I&#8217;ll pick out shoes for you! Loafers are definitely cool!]<br>&nbsp;<br>[Senpai, with your style these will look good on you!]<br>&nbsp;<br>[You can&#8217;t run in dress shoes!]<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Memories of the year since meeting Sasami flash through my mind like a flip book. My leather shoes worn to shreds after one year.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was as if they represented the current state of my heart.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;I&#8217;ll buy new shoes. I&#8217;ll go with shoes this time. So I should erase all my feelings for Sasami.<br>&nbsp;<br>I close my eyes, erasing the shoes from my vision. Like scooping out the pained parts of my heart, I concentrate my mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>And&#8211;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I reset the sisterly affection I held for Sasami.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Opening my eyes, the tattered shoes I was attached to now look like meaningless shoes. The stabbing pain in my chest disappears.<br>&nbsp;<br>My emotions towards Sasami have become flat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Looking at Sasami before me, I feel nothing. My heart remains cold. She&#8217;s just a stranger.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I see. After joining your training every morning this past year, that&#8217;s a cruel thing to say… Never get close again… Sasami-san, your center of gravity was slightly off this morning too. You should stop running to protect your old injury. It&#8217;s healed already. This is my last piece of advice.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;S-senpai! Your voice is too loud! Shimizu-senpai will&#8211;!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;…I won&#8217;t associate with you again.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Huh? What are you saying!? I-it&#8217;s not like I asked you to teach me! That&#8217;s super irritating…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Shimizu approaches me. I had forgotten about his presence.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;You, you were getting close to Sasami, huh! You creepy guy.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I just gave advice. Sasami was the one who wanted to learn from me.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Like hell I can believe that! Sure, Sasami has gotten faster recently, but that&#8217;s thanks to my guidance!!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;W-Well… Th-Thanks to you, Shimizu-senpai…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Sasami had a bitter expression. She probably understands it herself. The effects of the morning training.<br>&nbsp;</p>







<p>&nbsp;<br>I tried to leave this place without saying anything.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#8217;s about people who are no longer relevant to me.<br>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s no need to get involved anymore.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Hey, I told you to wait! Toudou, right!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>I dodge Shimizu&#8217;s arm as he tries to grab my shoulder. I sprint across the courtyard heading for the field.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t even understand why I started running myself. I should have just gone straight home right?<br>&nbsp;<br>But my feet won&#8217;t stop.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like blowing off some impulse.<br>&nbsp;<br>I sense Shimizu and Sasami chasing after me from behind.<br>&nbsp;<br>I continue running unconcerned.<br>&nbsp;<br>Glancing back, Shimizu wearing his jersey and athletic shoes is seriously chasing after me.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was the long distance ace right?<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I continue running with detachment. My tattered shoes seem unlikely to withstand my running. It&#8217;s fine if they break.<br>&nbsp;<br>The students practicing club activities on the field stir into commotion.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Why&#8217;s he running in his uniform?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Shimizu-san!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Shimizu-san looks pretty serious running huh? But that guy in uniform…he&#8217;s fast?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Yo, they&#8217;re on their second lap! Get a timer!! That guy in uniform is crazy fast!!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Like tearing something away, I continue running.<br>&nbsp;<br>My heart should be flat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet&#8211;this unease won&#8217;t disappear.<br>&nbsp;<br>Should I have let Sasami&#8217;s words slide off me? Endure the pain of a wounded heart while bearing her malice?<br>&nbsp;<br>Because I reset, my heart doesn&#8217;t hurt at all. My relationship with Sasami is over.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was no room left for discussion. It ended with a unilateral declaration.<br>&nbsp;<br>There&#8217;s nothing for me to be concerned about.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>But&#8211;<br>&nbsp;<br>But I couldn&#8217;t stop running.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;No way…Shimizu is half a lap behind! That guy…competed at the inter-high meet.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Who the hell is that guy in uniform!? Anyone know him!? Why&#8217;s he running on the field!?&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;What&#8217;s his time!? &#8211;No way…Did I mistime it? Those shoes…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>If I hadn&#8217;t reset my feelings for Hanazono, maybe Shimizu wouldn&#8217;t have directed malice at me…Do accumulated interpersonal relationships shape emotions?<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks to that, my connection with Sasami was also cut. But human relationships that crumble so easily were probably unnecessary anyway.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was just using me. Even thinking that doesn&#8217;t make me feel sad. My heart is empty.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>I exit the field and head outside the school. But still I continue running.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;There was no one to stop me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#8217;t need to think about people unrelated to me anymore.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>&#8211;Tanaka, school is really difficult.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Rarely, my sweat won&#8217;t stop. Around my face.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes your physical condition is just like that I guess.<br>&nbsp;<br>My heart is calm so it&#8217;s alright. It should be alright.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh right, starting tomorrow I need to stop my early morning jogs. Even if I change my route, there&#8217;s a possibility of running into her.<br>&nbsp;<br>With composure I consider my schedule for tomorrow. I have to do that or unnecessary thoughts will pop up in my head&#8211;<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>My shoes couldn&#8217;t withstand my running anymore and the soles came off.<br>&nbsp;<br>I stop and stare at the ground.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Even though I wanted to throw them away…for some reason I couldn&#8217;t.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Chapter 5: The Girl Whose Name I Don’t Know</h3>



<p> <br />Carrying my broken shoes, I head to the shoe store in the shopping district. After walking for a while, my mind calms down. There are no more problems.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />There are students from my academy everywhere in the shopping district.<br /> <br />Students from other schools are here in large numbers too. Some delinquent-looking students with chicken-like bleached hair and blonde hair are loitering in front of the convenience store.<br /> <br />I was taught by Hanazono that they are called delinquents, and are trying to affect an outlaw image. I don’t really understand it well.<br /> <br />This isn’t a slum or anything. It’s a relatively wealthy residential area.<br /> <br />“Look, that guy ain’t wearing shoes.”<br /> <br />“Seriously lame.”<br /> <br />The delinquents’ gazes are directed my way. I probably don’t need to pay them any special attention. More than that, I want to hurry and buy some shoes…What kind should I get?<br /> <br />To be honest, I have no sense for choosing clothes and accessories. How many times did Hanazono call me unfashionable?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I happen to look at the delinquents’ feet. What’s this, they’re wearing such cool shoes! I see, I should buy shoes shaped like those.<br /> <br />I want to get a closer look at those shoes.<br /> <br />So I approach the delinquents in front of the convenience store.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hah? Whaddya want? You pickin’ a fight?”<br /> <br />“Get outta here if you know what’s good for ya.”<br /> <br />I’d like to ask where they bought those shoes. But I don’t have the courage to talk to strangers.<br /> <br />Hmm, for now I’ll memorize the design and buy similar shoes.<br /> <br />“Ignoring me, huh! Hey, you!”<br /> <br />One of the delinquents grabs my shoulder and pushes me. There’s nothing to be particularly concerned about. It’s a common occurrence. Since they took the initiative to initiate physical contact, I’ll gather my courage and ask.<br /> <br />“What’s the brand of those shoes? Tell me.”<br /> <br />“…Huh? W-What’s wrong with this guy?”<br /> <br />Communicating is indeed difficult. The delinquent won’t tell me.<br /> <br />“Hey, wait up. This guy, ain’t he that Toudou guy Hime (princess) was talking about?”<br /> <br />“Huh, this is that [Toudou]? No way, he’s a total gloomy loner!”<br /> <br />“Idiot! Doesn’t he look just like the picture Hime drew?”<br /> <br />“Now that you mention it…”<br /> <br />“Sorry, but can you tell me the brand of those shoes? I’ll give you some candy as thanks.”<br /> <br />The delinquent releases my shoulder and has a sullen look on his face. What’s going on here? Why does conversing go so poorly? Is there something odd about my face?<br /> <br />Just then, a girl in flashy clothes comes out of the convenience store. One of the delinquents calls out “Oh, Hime, hello!!” to her.<br /> <br />I don’t know how to deal with more people joining. It makes me anxious.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Shaddup, losers. I’m gonna go eat crepes while… Huh?”<br /> <br />The flashy girl and I make eye contact. She looks familiar. But I have no memory of talking with such a garish girl.<br /> <br />Then again, she could be in my lost memories.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Her makeup is thicker than Tanaka’s. Her eye makeup is perfect. I see, it’s the kind of stage makeup made to stand out even from a distance.<br /> <br />She’s wearing what I can only describe as unfathomably high fashion clothes. The exposure of skin concerns me, but if I don’t look it’s not a problem.<br /> <br />But why is her face red?<br /> <br />“Y-y-you! Toudou! I-I wanted to see you so…”<br /> <br />“Sorry, your face seems very red, do you have some medical condition? I can recommend a skilled doctor if needed.”<br /> <br />“N-no! Don’t you remember me? Though I guess it doesn’t matter! Umm, what are you doing now, Toudou?”<br /> <br />“Me? I was just thinking of buying some cool sneakers, and wanted to ask him what brand his sneakers are.”<br /> <br />“Ok, got it! I’ll help pick them out! Let’s go!”<br /> <br />Something strange is happening.<br /> <br />Why is this girl being so kind to me? The only times I get approached by women on the street are for selling dubious paintings or religious solicitations.<br /> <br />…She has a refreshing smile. She must not be a bad kid.<br /> <br />“Well then, I’ll be in your care. Is it okay to leave your delinquent friends over there?”<br /> <br />As I say that, the delinquents have already disappeared from the scene.<br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s no problem! Come with me!”<br /> <br />She grabs my arm. I can smell lavender coming from this girl called Hime. Inhaling that scent calms my heart for some reason.<br /> <br />And so, we headed towards the shoe store.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Thank you so much as always!”<br /> <br />The cool sneakers were easy to obtain. Hime has quite good taste. I was about to hand over my tattered leather shoes to the clerk for disposal, but stopped at the last moment.<br /> <br />If I fix them up, maybe I can wear them again.<br /> <br />I decided to take the leather shoes home in a bag.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After that, Hime and I continued walking around the shopping district together for some reason.<br /> <br />I’m bothered by how close we’re walking, but this must just be Hime’s sense of personal space.<br /> <br />“The sneakers look great on you! You really haven’t changed since back then…”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry, I don’t have any memory of meeting you before.”<br /> <br />“Ehhh, even after that crazy thing that happened?”<br /> <br />Hime’s expression darkens a little. Did we know each other before?<br /> <br />“You don’t remember middle school? When I got caught by some half-ass thugs and you saved me?”<br /> <br />“I’m afraid I don’t understand what you mean.”<br /> <br />“Even though your attitude was totally different, that was definitely you back then.”<br /> <br />“Are you sure you have the right person?”<br /> <br />“…Hey, did you seriously forget that we were classmates in middle school?”<br /> <br />“What…is that so.”<br /> <br />Too many sad things happened in middle school. Maybe I messed up resetting my memories and erased them.<br /> <br />I don’t remember, so I don’t remember. But that’s pretty common, so it’s likely.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Seeing my troubled face, Hime forces a wry smile.<br /> <br />Is she pushing herself? Is this my fault?<br /> <br />“No, nevermind, it’s not a big deal! Ehehe, this is just me being self-satisfied.”<br /> <br />“I see, then let’s not worry about it.”<br /> <br />“Whaaa!? You should care about it a little!”<br /> <br />“Which is it?”<br /> <br />The female mind is very difficult. Just this little bit of conversation is enough to confuse me. I can’t comprehend the meaning at all.<br /> <br />As we finished descending the slope of the shopping district, Hime and I arrived at the station front.<br /> <br />“In middle school, I could only see you as a weirdo. Watching was really painful. That’s why I did mean things too.”<br /> <br />“Back then, I understood ‘normal’ even less than now. If it wasn’t for Hanazono, things would have been much worse.”<br /> <br />“Hanazono, huh… Yeah, because of her.”<br /> <br />“We’re no longer friends, but she was a very good girl.”<br /> <br />When I said those words, Hime spat out stronger words.<br /> <br />“Huh!? Don’t tell me… That’s definitely no good! You can forget me, just not Hanazono…”<br /> <br />“Oh? It’s unrelated to Hanazono, we just broke off ties. I haven’t forgotten her.”<br /> <br />Hime looks at me with sad eyes.<br /> <br />“No, it’s sad. …… “<br /> <br />I don’t understand what that’s supposed to mean. Hime is trying to convey something important to me. But unable to find the words, she just mumbles.<br /> <br />Why is this girl crying?<br /> <br />Hime’s hand grabbing my arm is shaking.<br /> <br />But I feel nothing in my heart. I wonder why?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At that moment, a man coming out of the convenience store in the mixed-use building yelled at us.<br /> <br />“Hey you!! What are you doing!? Did you make her cry!?”<br /> <br />A man with short hair, wearing a jersey. Even through his clothes you can see high-quality muscular build. He’s the type well-versed in exercise.<br /> <br />He’s yelling at me.<br /> <br />I’m in trouble now.<br /> <br />“Um, this is…”<br /> <br />“Listen, Natsuki, don’t get the wrong idea! I’m not crying or anything!”<br /> <br />“Shaddup, you keep quiet! You’re totally crying aren’t you!?”<br /> <br />“No, I’m not crying!”<br /> <br />It seems they know each other.<br /> <br />Now the two of them are starting a fight…<br /> <br />Looks like he misunderstood and thought I made Hime cry. She must be someone precious to him.<br /> <br />The misunderstanding should be cleared up by Hime.<br /> <br />“I keep telling you! I have someone I admire! And don’t be so familiar just because we’re childhood friends!”<br /> <br />…Is she talking about me? Saying that will only make him more heated up.<br /> <br />“Huh!? I’m just worried about you!”<br /> <br />“No, you’re just jealous!”<br /> <br />“Damn it! I’m not interested in kids!”<br /> <br />Seems they have a complicated relationship. This is a pain, so I’ll try to slip away.<br /> <br />When I tried to leave, he grabbed my arm.<br /> <br />He glared at me with an expression like an ogre.<br /> <br />“You, don’t just leave as you please. I’ll play with you a bit.”<br /> <br />“No, I have to study at home. I don’t have time to play.”<br /> <br />“Just come with me.”<br /> <br />His grip on my arm tightens. I wonder what kind of game we’ll be playing?<br /> <br />Wait a second. Maybe it’s an incredibly fun game I don’t know about. If so, I don’t mind.<br /> <br />“Understood. So where should I go?”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Huh? This guy…? Ah, whatever. Come on, we’ll ‘play’ at the boxing gym on the top floor of this building.”<br /> <br />“Natsuki!! Stop it! You’re a pro!”<br /> <br />“Hah? I just said we’ll play a bit.”<br /> <br />I don’t really understand, but if it’s just playing, it should be fine.<br /> <br />“I’m not sure what this is about, but I don’t mind.”<br /> <br />“No, you can’t! Natsuki is ranked boxer in Japan”<br /> <br />“Shaddup, you keep quiet.”<br /> <br />Following his instructions, I got in the elevator and headed up.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I know of the sport boxing. I have the rules in my head. But this will be my first time experiencing it.<br /> <br />I don’t really like violent games. I understand it’s a sport, but beginners shouldn’t be put in the ring.<br /> <br />No one is here to stop us. He sees me as someone to give a trial experience.<br /> <br />I put on the gloves and stepped into the ring for the first time. The ring floor is surprisingly hard. I thought it would be small, but it’s just the right size.<br /> <br />Hime watches me worriedly from outside the ring.<br /> <br />Natsuki, the man standing across from me, has his eyes fixed on me. But from how he’s loosening up, I can tell he doesn’t intend to seriously box me.<br /> <br />“We’ll start when the next buzzer sounds.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, give me a good time.”<br /> <br />“Hey, I was thinking it’s going too far to put you in the ring. Just mess around and throw some punches at me.”<br /> <br />The buzzer sounds and he takes a stance. As I thought, he doesn’t seem to have any intention of actually punching me.<br /> <br />“Hey trial guy! Throw some half-assed punches, it’s not like they’ll hit me so try it out!”<br /> <br />The middle-aged owner yells loudly. The owner of this gym seems to have a foul mouth.<br /> <br />This always happens to me. I get misunderstood about something, do or say the wrong thing, and get anger directed my way.<br /> <br />Too many things have been happening recently.<br /> <br />The memories bring no emotion now that my feelings have been reset, so it doesn’t matter. But still, I feel something murky deep in my chest.<br /> <br />“If you’re a man, throw some punches! Sheesh, useless…”<br /> <br />Natsuki takes some steps and lightly throws a punch. Not within hitting distance. I didn’t move an inch. No need to dodge punches you know won’t hit.<br /> <br />“Hmm… strange feeling.”<br /> <br />His number of punches gradually increases, and his footwork grows sharper. But they’re not punches trying to hit me.<br /> <br />I block punches that look like they’ll connect.<br /> <br />But is it really okay for me to punch…<br /> <br />“…Experienced? Those aren’t boxing moves. …I’ll go a little harder.”<br /> <br />Natsuki’s movements are truly magnificent. Making skillful use of footwork and powerful punch combinations. It’s easy to avoid since he doesn’t intend to actually hit me.<br /> <br />Despite his earlier tone, it seems he sincerely faces boxing.<br /> <br />“Hey, Natsuki!! What’s the use if you can’t land a hit! Put in some effort!! It’s useless if you’re slacking off in practice!”<br /> <br />“Shut up!! Just stay quiet!”<br /> <br />Seems like Natsuki also has a sharp tongue. Perhaps because of what the gym’s master said, his movements become even sharper. Punches interwoven with feints. I can feel a stir in the gym. I don’t like drawing attention.<br /> <br />“Hey, isn’t something weird? Natsuki-san doesn’t seem serious.”<br /> <br />“Can you dodge that? I can’t.”<br /> <br />“Hah… pretending to be an experienced observer?”<br /> <br />“But hey, it’s Natsuki-san, right? It’s impossible unless you’re in the ranker class.”<br /> <br />“He’s definitely slacking off.”<br /> <br />“…Or, isn’t that guy’s core strength insane? He hasn’t landed a single hit since earlier.”<br /> <br />“Is he just good at dodging?”<br /> <br />It’s better to end this quickly. But when will this end?<br /> <br />…Is it only over when I throw a punch? Natsuki is earnestly training in this sport. It would be disrespectful not to face him earnestly.<br /> <br />I reflect the boxing theories I’ve had as knowledge into my body.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Switching my focus—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Ahn… Huh? Ga!?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I feel the impact of my left hand striking Natsuki’s head. I don’t particularly like violence, but this is a sport.<br /> <br />The atmosphere in the entire gym seemed to change. Even though I finally landed a hit, no one praised me. Indeed, it’s a challenging sport.<br /> <br />“Hey, we can’t see! He’s not just a visitor!”<br /> <br />“Dangerous, stop. Natsuki-san is getting serious. He’s in the heavyweight class! The difference in size is dangerous.”<br /> <br />Natsuki looked at me with a bewildered expression. But soon, the atmosphere changed.<br /> <br />Indeed, his movements are completely different from just a moment ago.<br /> <br />Natsuki unleashes a flurry of punches, evading them. In an opening, I land a punch. It’s a sport, so I must not break anything. I must not hit a vital spot.<br /> <br />I could hear his heavy breathing.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After a while, Natsuki collapsed in the ring.<br /> <br />I see, so this is the ‘playing’ Natsuki mentioned. As expected, I can’t come to like violent games.<br /> <br />“Hey! Bring the first-aid kit! He’s got a concussion!!”<br /> <br />“Don’t take him out of the ring! Lay him down and let him rest! Someone must have put something in that guy’s gloves!”<br /> <br />“Natsuki, why aren’t you wearing headgear!? And you, if you’re not an amateur why didn’t you say so first!!”<br /> <br />“Get out! Don’t mess around! What gym are you with!? I won’t forgive this!!”<br /> </p>



<p>“He has a title match next month… Natsuki, hey, hang in there… You’re going to become the champion… You’ve got what it takes to be the first Japanese heavyweight world champion…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I was just playing so he shouldn’t be too damaged. He’ll regain consciousness soon.”<br /> <br />No one is listening to my words.<br /> <br />Hostile gazes pierce me. I feel something cold within my heart.<br /> <br />Why does this always happen…? Same in middle school. When I try hard, get excited, give it my all, I get hostility directed my way. Suspected of cheating.<br /> <br />I thought it would be fine since it’s just playing.<br /> <br />Looking at Natsuki lying in the ring, I feel guilt welling up from my chest.<br /> <br />I messed up again…<br /> <br />“Natsuki!! Are you okay!? Hang in there!”<br /> <br />Hime looked extremely worried clinging close to Natsuki.<br /> <br />I’m the one who caused this situation.<br /> <br />I made Hime make that face. Even though I thought we were getting along well, there’s no chance anymore.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />I got off the ring, forcibly took off the gloves, and changed into my uniform.<br /> <br />No one cares about me.<br /> <br />With complicated feelings, I tie the laces of the sneakers Hime picked out for me.<br /> <br />Why do I always end up like this…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I quietly left the gym.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />“W-wait up! Toudo!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I got off the elevator, Hime was standing at the building entrance.<br /> <br />Drenched in sweat, gasping for breath. Did she run down the stairs to get here first?<br /> <br />“I was scared I might not see you again, so I hurried over!”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry, I hurt someone important to you.”<br /> <br />I expected Hime to yell and scream at me. That’s my daily life. No matter where, I make mistakes, get scolded, and spend my days with heartache.<br /> <br />“No, that was his fault. And I’m to blame for not stopping it too. <em>pant</em>… Sorry, Toudo.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I never expected to be apologized to, so I was shocked.<br /> <br />“You’re the injured one here. I’ll tell everyone later. Getting mad at an amateur you invited into the ring is childish.”<br /> <br />“But I was the one mistaken…”<br /> <br />“No, you didn’t make a mistake. Everyone just isn’t dealing with you properly.”<br /> <br />This has never happened before. I make a mistake, get scolded, and live my days with heartache. I thought that was normal.<br /> <br />“You need to be more confident, Toudo. You really are amazing. Hanazono realizes that too.”<br /> <br />“Why are we talking about Hanazono?”<br /> <br />“Natsuki is getting in the way of the conversation, but there’s one thing I want to say. Face Hanazono properly.”<br /> <br />“That’s none of your concern.”<br /> <br />It can’t be helped that I lack confidence. Because I’m ignorant of the world.<br /> <br />But Hanazono is a separate issue. Hime has no right to tell me this.<br /> <br />I reset my feelings with Hanazono. So now she’s…<br /> <br />“It does concern me! That’s not…! I watched you two together all that time… I really wanted to be next to you instead! I wanted to switch places with Hanazono… But I, I…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A sensation like noise running through my head.<br /> <br />I remember this voice. I remember this scent.<br /> <br />A hot summer day. Beautiful evening sunset. Walking outside the castle moat together. The crying delinquents. Me holding Hime’s hand. Running through the night city.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Unfamiliar memories surface in my mind. But they quickly vanish.<br /> <br />“I don’t really understand, but I will deal with it properly.”<br /> <br />That was the best response I could give at my limit. Perhaps if my heart grows more in the future, I may have a different answer. But for now, this was the limit of my words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Even so, Hime nods happily.<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s good! Toudo, I know you’re a really nice guy! Next time we meet, I’ll make up properly with you!”<br /> <br />Waving her hand at me while boarding the elevator, she bids me farewell.<br /> <br />There must have been something between us.<br /> <br />But there’s no need to know what.<br /> <br />After the elevator doors close, I wave my hand slightly and murmur.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…I wish you had told me your name.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I gaze at my own hand raised to the sky.<br /> <br />It feels like the cloudiness in my chest has cleared up a little.<br /> </p>


<h3>Chapter 6: My Childhood Friend</h3>



<p> <br />I headed to school today wearing my new sneakers again. The leather shoes were left in the closet. It’s been a week since that day. I make sure to wipe my sneakers every time I get home now. It’s become a new routine. As I wipe my sneakers, I feel like I can understand Hime’s feelings a little.<br /> <br />…Or at least I feel like I can, even though I really don’t understand.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It takes 30 minutes to leisurely walk from my house to the academy. I can get there in just under 5 minutes if I run.<br /> <br />I like the morning air. It makes me feel refreshed.<br /> <br />Since it was the rush hour for students commuting to school, the narrow road to school was overflowing with students.<br /> <br />I liked the atmosphere of walking to school. We’re all headed towards the same goal, the academy. It feels like orienteering. It gets me excited.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Good morning! Miki-chan, did you change your hair? It looks cute!”<br /> <br />“Hehe, you noticed? It’s more mature right?”<br /> <br />“Oh crap, I’m gonna be late for morning practice!”<br /> <br />“Zzz…zzz”<br /> <br />“Hey, did you see that drama yesterday? It was so cool!”<br /> <br />“Ugh…school…”<br /> <br />“That girl from the special class was like–“<br /> <br />Others were having lively conversations I could never mimic. Their minds must work quickly. It’s too difficult for me.<br /> <br />Come to think of it, there was one other change. I stopped my morning jogging routine on the way to school. Instead I switched to running at night.<br /> <br />I don’t need to jog slowly anymore. I don’t need to match Sasami’s pace anymore.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I was very surprised by Sasami’s change in attitude.<br /> <br />I tried hard this past week to understand her feelings, but it was futile. What exactly is affection? Is Shimizu really that charming to her…? I just don’t understand young people’s thoughts. I used to have affections for my childhood friend, Hanazono. But since I reset my emotions, I can’t recall those affections anymore.<br /> <br />In any case, it’s irrelevant now. Both Sasami and Hanazono are strangers to me.<br /> <br />Yes, my heart doesn’t hurt, my mind is as flat as always. But the princess’s words float around in my mind.<br /> <br />–“Make up with her, okay?”<br /> <br />It’s not like we had a fight. We just grew distant and our relationship dissolved.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />As I got closer to school, more and more students appeared.<br /> <br />More familiar faces showed up.<br /> <br />But even though I recognize them, we’ve never spoken.<br /> <br />Everyone is in their own groups, while I’m the only loner.<br /> <br />When did I start to feel lonely about this?<br /> <br />It makes my chest tighten.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Sasaki from my class. Tadokoro-san and Yamada. Kenzaki and Hashii-san, Saito-san and Yamaguchi. Oh, Tanaka…<br /> <br />“Hey! Toudou, you’re here early! I came way too early!”<br /> <br />“Oh, uh, good morning, Tanaka.”<br /> <br />Yawning lazily as she walked, Tanaka called out to me. I tense up at the sudden interaction.<br /> <br />Tanaka came up to me unconcerned about what others may think.<br /> <br />“So, what’s up? I’ve been waiting for you to contact me…When are you gonna take me to that cafe?”<br /> <br />“Oh…”<br /> <br />I pretend to have forgotten. Because I thought if I did that, I could preserve the warm feelings.<br /> <br />Getting closer would increase the potential damage if I got hurt.<br /> <br />Tanaka lightly knocked on my head.<br /> <br />“You totally forgot! Geez! You better get me a juice and some sweets now! I’m looking forward to it! Don’t forget okay?”<br /> <br />For some reason Tanaka feels special to me. Is it because she’s been so kind to me at my part-time job? It must be in my head.<br /> <br />I have to fulfill the promise we made.<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’ll take care of it–I mean, I’ll decide by the next time I work my part-time job. So, uh, could you give me your contact info?”<br /> <br />Just asking for a girl’s contact makes me nervous with fear. What if I phrase it weirdly? What if she finds it creepy? No, Tanaka isn’t that type of girl. It’ll be fine.<br /> <br />“Oh yeah, I guess I don’t have Toudou’s number yet! Let’s exchange! Hehe.”<br /> <br />I opened the messaging app that I rarely use.<br /> <br />I only use it when communicating with Hanazono. When I checked the app, Hanazono’s message caught my eye.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Tsuyoshi, I just want to talk to you one more time. Please, reply to me.]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I had been ignoring that message.<br /> <br />It’s okay, nothing comes to mind—yet, I felt a sense of guilt for doing something wrong.<br /> <br />“What’s wrong? Don’t you understand how to use it? Well, you know, you can exchange messages by bringing your smartphone closer—”<br /> <br />Tanaka approached me, her entire body moving towards me. Somehow, she smells really nice.<br /> <br />A gentle scent… it’s calming…<br /> <br />“Hey, are you sleeping or what!? Okay, this should be fine! Uh? Isn’t that Hanazono-san?”<br /> <br />Tanaka slowly moves away from me. I felt a slight reluctance for a moment.<br /> <br />I follow Tanaka’s gaze.<br /> <br />Hanazono was walking on the road across from us, on the other side of the commuting path. She looked pale. Her walking pace was slower than usual. It worries me whether she’s eating properly. It worries me if she’s gotten sick. It worries me if she’s injured.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />–Hanazono, why are you alone this morning? You always walked to school with your friends before right?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I stopped in my tracks.<br /> <br />“Welp, I’ll go on ahead! Toudou’s gonna go see Hanazono-san!”<br /> <br />“But, I don’t have to–“<br /> <br />“Just go, go!”<br /> <br />Tanaka looked at me gently with a smile. Like a mother. –Since I don’t have a mother, I can only imagine. I thought all adults were cold.<br /> <br />Tanaka pushed hard against my back.<br /> <br />My feet started moving towards Hanazono on their own.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“See ya Toudou! Let’s talk again! Hehe, you’ll treat me to karaoke too!”<br /> <br />Tanaka hummed a trendy song as she left.<br /> <br />… she’s a very good singer?<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />I crossed the road to the other sidewalk and came face to face with Hanazono.<br /> <br />We both met unexpectedly.<br /> <br />Hanazono had a complicated expression. Happy, sad…regretful…<br /> <br />She started to say something but closed her mouth. I didn’t say anything either.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Hey Hanazono, why are you alone? Isn’t it lonely by yourself?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I’m worried but…I don’t have affections for her anymore–so it shouldn’t matter.<br /> <br />…That’s no good. That’s why I’m still a child. My affections may be gone but…I can’t erase our history completely.<br /> <br />Hime’s words left a small crack in the shell around my heart.<br /> <br />I can still feel the sensation of Tanaka’s push against my back. I’ll take a step forward.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono and I naturally turned into the side road off the main commuting path.<br /> <br />It’s a detour from the direct route to school, so there are fewer students walking here. It’s a road Hanazono and I used to walk down a lot together.<br /> <br />“What, do you hate me now…”<br /> <br />“It’s not that I hate you. …I just reset my emotions. Why are you alone this morning, Hanazono?”<br /> <br />No, that’s not what I wanted to say. I called out because you looked lonely.<br /> <br />I was worried. That’s why I said something.<br /> <br />Why won’t the right words come out?<br /> <br />“It’s…it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it…” Then she said, “Ah, sorry. I just can’t be honest can I…Even though I know how awkward you are. <em>sigh</em>…I really am hopeless.”<br /> <br />“It’s my fault–“</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I choke on my words. It’d be easy to blame myself. But that won’t let me move forward.<br /> <br />This is an issue between me and Hanazono. Self-containment is the wrong solution.<br /> <br />I need to talk it out. Consider her feelings. Even if my emotions are reset, even if my interest is gone.<br /> <br />“What happened?”<br /> <br />“Oh it’s no big deal. I just got in a fight with a friend yesterday…I-It’s not because she said anything about you! Don’t get the wrong idea!”<br /> <br />“I see. Do you think…you can make up with your friend?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, if we talk it out properly later, it’ll be fine. We fight all the time after all–“<br /> <br />I guess they can usually work it out by talking. Just like Tanaka said.<br /> <br />“I’m glad.”<br /> <br />“I’m an awful girl, so it’s no wonder you hate me.”<br /> <br />“No, that’s not–“<br /> <br />It’s not that I hate her. My faint affections just faded away. The fond memories and warm feelings for her in my heart faded away.<br /> <br />“It’s okay. It’s my fault–I really am sorry.”<br /> <br />“No, it’s my–I reset, so–“<br /> <br />I accidentally raise my voice. There are still a small number of students walking this side road. They look at us curiously. I don’t like those gazes.<br /> <br />No, I can’t trouble Hanazono anymore.<br /> <br />Ever since middle school I’ve relied on her too much already. I can’t keep doing this–<br /> <br />“Hehe, you’re still awkward but so kind. Now I feel like there’s a huge wall between us. Like when we met again in middle school…it’s like talking to a total stranger…The distance feels terrifyingly far.”<br /> <br />Even though my affections for her were supposedly reset…<br /> <br />Somehow my chest tightens. I don’t understand what this pain is. My sadness should have disappeared when I erased my affections.<br /> <br />“You went overboard, you know. You don’t listen to others and just do things your own insensitive way. But this time gave me a chance to think…I realized–“<br /> <br />Hanazono looked at me gently.<br /> <br />Seeing her expression makes my heart beat a little faster.<br /> <br />“–I was the one dependent on you. …Because you’re so kind. You listen to everything I say and only think about me. I should have done more to help you grow…After all, I was the only one you could talk to. –Maybe I took pride in that.”<br /> <br />Grow…Have I not grown since middle school? It’s true, I haven’t changed much since then. Even in high school, I kept relying on Hanazono.<br /> <br />Just now, Hanazono denied that.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“It was my fault–“<br /> <br />“Oh come on! It’s not your fault! Because that’s just who Toudou Tsuyoshi is, and I didn’t try to change that even though I knew…<em>sigh</em>…I’m really hopeless. Resetting feelings… Haha, what is that? It’s strange, even though it’s something unusual, I understand. Well, it’s not the first time, after all.”<br /> <br />Hanazono bit her lip, looking frustrated.<br /> <br />“Sorry— I can’t explain it well, but…”<br /> <br />“Nah, don’t apologize. The frustration is about my past foolishness. I even thought a love letter… that Tsuyoshi would definitely accept it… Yeah, I was that conceited.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That’s right. I was a convenient guy. Along with my feelings, that fact had also faded away.<br /> <br />Vivid memories from the past come to my mind.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Me, looking dull and uninterested, and Hanazono with an annoyed expression.<br /> <br />“Who are you?” “Don’t remember? Hanazono. …I’m the one taking care of you.” “I don’t know you.” “Huh? Stop joking. Anyway, do you remember the promise?” “I don’t know about any promise.” “Oh, I see.”<br /> <br />We restarted our relationship from a cold start. As time passed… we nurtured our connection.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After watching a movie, we ate ice cream. When buying snacks, we exchanged and tasted each other’s choices. I caught Hanazono when she almost tripped. Because she couldn’t wake up in the morning, I called her. To improve my poor communication skills, she chatted with me a lot. She chose my outfits, being indifferent to fashion. She listened to my whims or got sulky if I didn’t. We thought together about how to interact with classmates. She helped me when I was left out during class groupings. When things didn’t go well in relationships, she comforted me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I… in an instant, erased the feelings we had developed together.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />My chest hurts. What is this pain? It’s different from when people talked behind my back.<br /> <br />It’s painful… emotions can’t be suppressed.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Didn’t I feel no regret? Wasn’t it supposed to be irrelevant now?<br /> <br />There’s no affection… still—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono’s calm expression turns into a smile.<br /> <br />That’s the face I liked. It’s stored in my memory.<br /> <br />Hanazono’s body trembles slightly, and suddenly she slaps her own face.<br /> <br />“Oww… Yeah, I’ve reset my feelings for Tsuyoshi too! If you can do it, so can I! Haha, yeah, forget all the memories… and erase the feeling I have for you… Starting fresh—”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />You can’t do something like that…<br /> <br />Resetting, is it something an ordinary person can do?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />If you’ve reset, why are you crying? Why do you have such a sad expression?<br /> <br />That’s not resetting. Resetting is erasing emotions…<br /> <br />Hanazono extends trembling hands forward.<br /> <br />Like the first time we met, she looks cold, yet there’s a gentle feeling visible.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Tsuyoshi… from scratch… Please, let’s truly become friends.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I grip my chest with my own hand.<br /> <br />I don’t feel love. But—something inside me is raging. The pain holds it back.<br /> <br />I grit my teeth. I taste the flavor of blood in my mouth—<br /> <br />Ah, frustrating. I can’t express myself well.<br /> <br />I wonder what kind of face I’m making?<br /> <br />Surely, it’s an expressionless one—<br /> <br />But, it seemed like Hanazono is waiting for my words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I reset my affection for Hanazono—no, that’s not the right word… I’ll handle it differently—no, that’s not it, I am—”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono waited patiently for my words.<br /> <br />Her body was still trembling. She gave me courage.<br /> <br />I should be more honest with myself.<br /> <br />Did I hate the lonely me? Did my chest ache seeing the lonely Hanazono?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />If that’s the case—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Again… I want to be friends.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I grab Hanazono’s trembling hand. It’s nothing special; I’m trembling too.<br /> <br />When our hands overlapped, it felt like the trembling had stopped.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Yeah, thank you. Now, I really want to let Tsuyoshi have a normal youth…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In a low voice, Hanazono mutters, “No matter how many times you reset, I won’t give up.”<br /> <br />That’s right, we’ll start from here. I’ll blow away the gossip I heard from my cherished childhood friend, reset, and start a new relationship.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Higu… Haha… Why am I… crying? I-I mean, it’s not like I, don’t like you at all… Higu… Hey, Tsuyoshi, let’s—let’s make lots of friends this time. Let’s play with everyone… Hikku…”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="../Images/0019_DZVtmVu.jpg" alt="" /><!--  https://i.imgur.com/DZVtmVu.jpg  --></div></figure>


<p>The something swirling violently in my chest–feels settled now.<br /> <br />For the first time, I was able to truly understand how precious relationships with people can be.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />With all my emotion, thoughts, determination, and gratitude–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I’ll change. –Hanazono.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It’s the moment I faced Hanazono, and others, for the first time–</p>
