<h1>Chapter 1: Working Hard for My Sister’s Online Wife</h1>


<p>It was late June on Friday.</p>



<p>The fourth period had just ended, and as the teacher stepped out into the hallway, the tension that had gripped the classroom instantly relaxed. </p>



<p>Amidst the cheerful voices of classmates, I took out my bento from my bag. Seated to my left, a girl named Takase Narumi let out a contented stretch.</p>



<p>“Ugh, finally lunchtime! Huh? Where are you going, Maho-chi?”</p>



<p>“I have something to ask the teacher. You go ahead and eat first.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, Maho-chi, you’re such a hard worker. Good luck!”</p>



<p>Takase waved her hand cheerfully before placing her bento on the desk. Suddenly noticing my gaze, she flashed a smile.</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-kun, you brought bento again today.”</p>



<p>“The cafeteria is too crowded. I get so hungry lately, I can’t stand the waiting.”</p>



<p>“I get it. By the time the second period ends, I’m always starving too. Maybe we’re both going through a growth spurt?”</p>



<p>“Could be. You seem to be getting taller too, Takase.”</p>



<p>“Really? That would be nice. Oh, maybe it’s better if you don’t grow any taller, Fujisaki-kun.”</p>



<p>“Oh… Well, too much height can be intimidating…”</p>



<p>“You’re a nice person. Even if you get taller, you won’t be intimidating.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. But you might end up bumping your head on doors ~”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see. I guess I should start training my head now to avoid that.”</p>



<p>“Haha, you’re not planning to dodge, are you? Then, I’ll prepare band-aids if you do hit your head.”</p>



<p>Despite the trivial nature of our conversation, Takase looked genuinely happy. When I watched her smile, my cheeks relaxed involuntarily.</p>



<p>Indeed, Takase was cute. Her tall, bright voice, doll-like sparkling eyes, translucent chestnut hair cascading down to her shoulders, and her petite, delicate figure—everything about her was endearing.</p>



<p>Being tall with an intimidating aura, I often found myself being perceived as scary, especially by girls. It took some time getting used to, but once people got to know me, things usually normalize. However, at the beginning, there was that initial wariness and they tended to keep their distance.</p>



<p>However, right after starting high school, Takase shattered that norm. Even though it was our first encounter, she greeted me with a friendly, <em>“Wow, you’re tall! It’s cool!” </em></p>



<p>From that day onwards, a year and three months had passed. Even so, my one-sided crush was still going strong. During last month’s seat rearrangement, I managed to secure the seat next to her, allowing us to casually chat like this.</p>



<p>Now, my goal was to deepen my friendship with Takase and hopefully exchange contact information before the end of the semester. I wanted to be able to invite her to hang out during summer break. </p>



<p>I even switched from being a cafeteria regular to bringing my own lunch, all in the hope of getting closer to her. While Takase usually started to eat right away, she was waiting for her friend at the moment. This was the perfect opportunity to strengthen our bond.</p>



<p>“By the way, how crowded does the cafeteria get?” she asked.</p>



<p>“Are you interested?”</p>



<p>“I thought I’d give the cafeteria a try for once. Does it have long lines?”</p>



<p>“It does. There’s a long queue in front of the ticket machine. Besides, the popular menu sell out quickly. I managed to get them in my first year because my classroom was close, but I haven’t been able to since becoming a second-year.”</p>



<p>“Popular menu, huh? Is it curry?”</p>



<p>“You’re close. The first syllable is <em>‘ka.’</em>“</p>



<p>“Hmm, what could it be? Carbonara, maybe?”</p>



<p>“Never seen Carbonara there. Do you need a hint?”</p>



<p>“If you’re offering, sure!”</p>



<p>“Alright, here’s your hint: The most popular item is an auspicious dish.”</p>



<p>Takase tilted her neck and crossed her arms, mumbling, “auspicious, auspicious…” to herself.</p>



<p>“Naru-chan, sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>



<p>A flashy girl called out to Takase.</p>



<p>She had a long, silky blonde hair cascading down to her waist and vibrant blue eyes—Momoi Maho. When she approached us, Takase instantly brightened up.</p>



<p><em>Is our time to chat over already?</em> I wanted to talk more… Momoi said she had a question for the teacher, but did she cut it short for Takase’s sake?</p>



<p>“What are you staring at?”</p>



<p>“I’m not staring.”</p>



<p>I quickly averted my gaze under those piercing blue eyes. Takase, as if mediating, clapped her hands.</p>



<p>“That’s right! We’re playing a game to guess the most popular menu in the cafeteria. According to Fujisaki-kun here, it’s a dish believed to bring good luck. What do you think, Maho-chi?”</p>



<p>“<em>Osechi</em> (New Year’s dish)?”</p>



<p>“There’s no <em>osechi</em> in the cafeteria.”</p>



<p>“Here’s a hint: It starts with ‘Ka.’”</p>



<p>“<em>Kamaboko</em> (fish cakes)?”</p>



<p>“Do high schoolers order <em>kamaboko</em> at the cafeteria?”</p>



<p>“You said it’s something lucky. Just tell the answer already.”</p>



<p>“The correct answer is <em>Katsu</em> Curry.”</p>



<p>“What’s lucky about that?”</p>



<p>“It brings good luck. The name has ‘winning’ <em>(katsu)</em> in it.”</p>



<p>“What is that? It’s not even a pun.”</p>



<p>“It’s a pun for good luck. Besides, why do you know that <em>kamaboko</em> is considered lucky when you don’t even know why <em>katsu</em> curry is considered lucky?”</p>



<p>“I read it in the New Year’s dishes manual. Anyway, don’t just casually talk to me.”</p>



<p>With a piercing glare, Momoi threw those words at me. However, despite the harshness, there was a slight furrow in her eyebrows, and she looked somewhat apologetic.</p>



<p>Momoi was known for her aversion to guys almost as much as for her beauty. However, her cold attitude towards guys was more of an act. </p>



<p>Even from my perspective, who had Takase’s tunnel-vision, Momoi was undeniably attractive. With her being a half-Japanese with blonde hair and blue eyes, plus the added bonus of being well-endowed and wealthy, she was the object of widespread male attention. This, unfortunately, led to bullying by jealous girls during middle school.</p>



<p>That’s why to protect herself, she kept guys at a distance and feigning a dislike for them to temper the jealousy of other girls.</p>



<p>Back when I didn’t know this situation, I just thought she was an unfriendly person. Of course, things had changed now. I knew Momoi was a good person at heart, and I had learned to brush off her coldness.</p>



<p>“Did you manage to ask the teacher your question?”</p>



<p>As soon as Takase brought up the topic, Momoi showed a warm smile.</p>



<p>“I did. Thanks for waiting.”</p>



<p>“Good food is meant to be shared with friends, right?”</p>



<p>“Kotomi-san, sorry for keeping you waiting too.”</p>



<p>Momoi turned to the girl sitting to my right.</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine…” Kotomi, my twin sister with glossy black hair tied into twin tails, muttered softly and shot me a quick glance, “Haru-nii, sorry…”</p>



<p>“It’s fine.”</p>



<p>I stood up with my bento in hand and swapped seats with Kotomi.</p>



<p>The occupant of the seat in front of me was a cafeteria regular. Since they wouldn’t be back for a while, it would be nice if Kotomi could sit there. However, my timid sister couldn’t bring herself to take someone else’s seat, even if it was unoccupied.</p>



<p>As I ate my lunch at my sister’s desk, I eavesdropped on Momoi and the others’ conversation.</p>



<p>“Oh? Kotomi-san, your bento looks different today.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s a bit smaller. Did your usual one break?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>“It was so cute; what a shame.”</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s dig in.”</p>



<p>They clasped their hands together and began their meal.</p>



<p>Kotomi hadn’t spoken much so far, but for someone who spent a long time in solitude, having a meal together was a significant progress. My sister, who was introverted and shy, used to spend her break times pretending to sleep. But now she was able to sit down for a meal with friends. </p>



<p>And it was all thanks to the offline meeting.</p>



<p>About forty days ago, it was revealed that Kotomi had an online game wife. Although they planned to meet up, Kotomi played the game under the handle name ‘Jet Black Yasha’ while posing to be an outgoing guy.</p>



<p>However, real-life Kotomi was shy and not good with words. She was worried that meeting face-to-face would make her nervous and ruin the conversation, fearing that she would be disliked by her online game wife.</p>



<p>That’s why, on the night before the offline meeting, Kotomi asked me to be her stand-in.</p>



<p>Though it was a last-minute request, the online game was a crucial emotional anchor for Kotomi. To protect her cherished space, I immersed myself in otaku knowledge overnight, attended the offline meeting, and discovered that Kotomi’s online game wife ‘Mahorin’ was, in fact, Momoi Maho.</p>



<p>Although she concealed it at school, she really was a hard-core otaku.</p>



<p>Despite being overwhelmed by her enthusiasm, the meeting succeeded without her realizing I was just a stand-in. She seemed to enjoy our offline meeting too, but she left me with a pointed remark.</p>



<p><em>—We’re just online game couple, and that won’t change in real life.</em></p>



<p>In other words, Momoi told me not to fall for her, and I responded with a simple ‘yes.’ While I couldn’t deny her beauty, my heart was set on Takase. No matter how close I got to Momoi, I wouldn’t develop feelings for her.</p>



<p>After two offline meetings, she finally believed that I, Fujisaki Haruto, wouldn’t fall for Momoi Maho. She then made an unexpected request: she wanted us to pretend to be a couple.</p>



<p>She explained that she felt uneasy being the only one without a boyfriend when her friends—Takase Narumi, Kotobuki Ran, and Aoki Aoi—had one. To avoid a messy situation, Momoi chose me who had no interest in her.</p>



<p>—Well, it turned out none of them actually had boyfriends.</p>



<p>But with the celebratory atmosphere, we couldn’t bring ourselves to say,<em> “Actually, we were just pretending.” </em>That’s why until now, we were still maintaining the façade of being a couple. Only Takase, Kotobuki, and Aoki knew about this, which allowed us to enjoy a peaceful school life without arousing jealousy from other guys.</p>



<p>“Kotomi-san, your lunch looks delicious today too.”</p>



<p>“Thanks. My mom would be happy to hear that.”</p>



<p>“Don’t you cook, Fujisaki-san?”</p>



<p>“U-um…”</p>



<p>“It’s fun to pack your favorite dishes, you know.”</p>



<p>Momoi grinned, “But Naru-chan, you pack too many of your favorites. Don’t you think so too, Kotomi-san?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, there’s so much meat.”</p>



<p>“Exactly. You eat so much meat every day, yet you maintain that figure. It’s impressive.”</p>



<p>“I play basketball every day!”</p>



<p>“Since middle school?”</p>



<p>“Though I’m a basketball fanatic now, the reason I joined was because I heard playing basketball could make you taller.”</p>



<p>“How tall were you back then?”</p>



<p>“About 140 centimeters, maybe?”</p>



<p>“And now you’re around 155, right? You’ve really grown.”</p>



<p>“Must be from all those jumps. But, I envy you, Maho-chi. You’re around 170, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“I’m not that tall. About the same as Kotomi-san, I think?”</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-san… around 165?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>“Wow. It’s nice that both siblings are tall. Are your parents tall too?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>Even though Momoi and Takase were leading the conversation, Kotomi only provided brief responses. It wasn’t just today; it was always like this. She could engage in a proper conversation with Momoi but answered Takase with mere ‘yeah.’</p>



<p>There were two reasons for this. First, the topics didn’t involve anime. Second, Kotomi was shy around Takase. If she could relax and have a conversation, like when she became friends with Momoi, things might be different. But with the otaku talk being off-limit, that was hard.</p>



<p>Of course, Kotomi had the freedom to choose her friends. If she was content being alone, she didn’t have to force herself to be friends with Takase. However, I knew my sister desired friendship, and that she wanted to be close to Takase. </p>



<p>As evidence of her efforts, Kotomi had even switched to a basketball-themed bento, hoping to catch Takase’s interest and use it as a conversation starter. But despite her best intentions, she remained unnoticed by Takase and became the usual response machine.</p>



<p>Still, today, I felt she was responding more frequently, making an effort in her own way. If she continued to grow like this, the day would come when they could enjoy lively meals together.</p>



<p>I savored my lunch, dreaming of a day when me and my sister could have a pleasant meal with Takase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>That evening.</p>



<p>Having finished dinner and a quick bath, I diligently tackled my homework, delving into the review for the first semester. Final exams were scheduled for five days in early July, and I was committed to preparing for them.</p>



<p>I wasn’t naturally inclined towards studying. Back in middle school, I was the type to cram right before exams. However, entering high school brought about a transformation in me.</p>



<p>After learning about Takase’s struggle with studying, I harbored the hope that if I showcased my intelligence, she would rely on me when in need of help with studies. With this expectation in my heart, I started studying.</p>



<p>Last month marked a significant moment for me. I had a study session with Momoi and Takase, and after earnestly teaching them, I received the compliment, <em>“Fujisaki-kun, you’re so kind.”</em></p>



<p>I managed to appeal as someone reliable last time. Perhaps this time, I could be relied upon again. Following that, I might be able to steer conversations toward post-exam plans like, <em>“Let’s have fun when the exams are over!” “How about going to the beach?” “Sounds great! Let’s go to the beach!”</em> And the image of Takase in a swimsuit—just too enticing…</p>



<p>To ensure I could spend that ideal summer, I needed to study with enthusiasm!</p>



<p>“Haru-nii, are you awake?”</p>



<p>It was around 9 PM when Kotomi’s voice reached me along with a gentle knock.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m up,” I replied through the door, and Kotomi timidly opened it. </p>



<p>Clad in an anime T-shirt and knee-length shorts, she looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong, Kotomi?”</p>



<p>“I… I need your help, Haru-nii.”</p>



<p>“Is the homework too difficult?”</p>



<p>“I do need help with that, but it’s not about homework…”</p>



<p>“Is there a bug in your room?”</p>



<p>“No, not a bug…”</p>



<p>Kotomi averted her eyes awkwardly, struggling to articulate her thoughts. I recognized this expression; I’d seen it frequently since last month.</p>



<p>“…Is this related to Mahorin?”</p>



<p>Kotomi nodded faintly.</p>



<p>“It’s about Mahorin again…”</p>



<p>“Got it. Another offline meeting?”</p>



<p>Kotomi had been playing a game called “Life of Farmer” since her second year of middle school. It was a slow-life simulation where players took on the role of farm owners and interacted with each other in the game world. </p>



<p>In this virtual realm, Kotomi married Mahorin.</p>



<p>Apparently, marriage in the game left a chat log as a record of the couple’s journey, and Kotomi enjoyed their conversations so much that she decided to get married.</p>



<p>The chat logs with Mahorin mainly revolved around anime, manga, and games. Consequently, when it came to offline meetings, discussions naturally gravitated  towards these topics. </p>



<p>However, the problem was that I had zero interest and knowledge in anime, manga, or games. Sure, I might recognize popular titles like Doraemon, Demon Slayer, or Pokémon, but that was about it.</p>



<p>Over the past month, I had acquired knowledge about anime and games like Driste, Urbat, and <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>, but it paled in comparison to Kotomi’s expertise. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, to avoid blowing my cover as a stand-in, I must be able to keep up with otaku discussions. For the success of the offline meeting, acquiring the necessary knowledge was crucial. I could accept watching anime at this point. After all, the anime Kotomi recommended turned out to be enjoyable, and it wasn’t like I hated reading manga or playing games. </p>



<p>The real issue was the timing of the offline meeting. If it was scheduled for tomorrow, I’d have to scold my sister—<em>does the word “repent” even exist in your dictionary?</em></p>



<p>“No, it’s not an offline meeting.”</p>



<p><em>Not an offline meeting?</em></p>



<p>“But it’s related to Mahorin, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, exactly.” Kotomi nodded and proceeded to explain, “You know, Mahorin’s birthday is the same as Bit Hot-chan’s.”</p>



<p>“Bit Hot-chan… the character with droopy eyes from <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>?”</p>



<p>“That’s the one! Haru-nii, you remembered!”</p>



<p>“Well, we just went to the art exhibition the other day.”</p>



<p>As for the <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em> exhibition, Kotomi and Momoi discussed going together at the amusement park, but I only found out two days before the event that I was joining them.</p>



<p>Momoi wanted to be friends with an otaku girl, and now that the two of them had become friends, I figured my role was done. From now on, Momoi and Kotomi would enjoy their otaku activities together.</p>



<p>That was what I assumed, but Momoi didn’t seem inclined to exclude me.</p>



<p>It made sense when you thought about it. I went by the name Jet Black Yasha. For Momoi, Jet Black Yasha was her first otaku friend. There was no way she would leave me out considering her friendly nature.</p>



<p>That’s why it was settled that the three of us would engage in otaku activities together. Therefore, when I heard the mention of Bit Hot-chan’s birthday and the connection to Mahorin, I braced myself, thinking it was another invitation to otaku activities. But…</p>



<p>“Just to be clear, I have no idea when Bit Hot-chan’s birthday is.”</p>



<p>“Didn’t you check her profile at the art exhibition?”</p>



<p>“I was too sleepy at that time.”</p>



<p>I was only informed two days before the art exhibition. Back then, <em>Passionate Warrior Princess </em>had aired up to the tenth episode of its third season. So I needed to catch up with the latest episodes before the exhibit.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for the trouble…”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. You’re not to blame for anything regarding the art exhibition.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Haru-nii…”</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it. Now, getting back to the point, when is Bit Hot-chan’s birthday?”</p>



<p>“July 2nd.”</p>



<p>“In nine days, huh? Since you’re talking about her birthday, does it mean you’ve been invited to a birthday party?”</p>



<p>“No, not yet.”</p>



<p>“I see. Well, Momoi will probably contact you soon.”</p>



<p>July 2nd fell on Sunday. Her three close friends would definitely be there to celebrate. While I wasn’t sure where the birthday party would be held, Kotomi was Momoi’s friend, so she’d get a call soon.</p>



<p>“By the way, I told Mahorin… I mean, Momoi-san, that I’d give her the best present ever.”</p>



<p>“Momoi will love that.”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Kotomi smiled happily, but her expression darkened soon after. “But when I thought about it, it will end up being a present from you, Haru-nii…”</p>



<p>Indeed, a present from Jet Black Yasha implied it was gift from Fujisaki Haruto. I would be the one giving Momoi the ‘best present.’</p>



<p>But that was something I could manage.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of the present.”</p>



<p>“But… Haru-nii, are you sure about spending your allowance?”</p>



<p>“Don’t sweat it. Unlike you, I’m the type who saves money.”</p>



<p>After all, Momoi was my friend too. She treated me to clothes and a wristwatch before, that’s why spending a bit for her wasn’t an issue. Although I probably wouldn’t be invited to the birthday celebration, there would be an otaku meetup eventually. I could give her the present then.</p>



<p>“By the way, what are you getting her, Kotomi?” I asked casually.</p>



<p>Kotomi’s expression turned serious. It looked like the real discussion was about to start.</p>



<p>“I was thinking of giving her a plushie.”</p>



<p>“A plushie?”</p>



<p>“A plushie of her favorite character.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like a good idea.”</p>



<p>Girls generally loved plushies, and a plushie of their favorite character would likely bring joy.</p>



<p>“I thought it was a great idea, but it’s a bit tricky…”</p>



<p>“Tricky?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. It’d be easier to show you. Come with me.”</p>



<p>Following her request, I followed Kotomi to her room. Even though I helped her clean it recently, it was already messy again.</p>



<p>“You should ventilate the place occasionally, or you’ll get sick.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be fine.”</p>



<p>“Get a professional to clean your air conditioner. You haven’t cleaned it once since you bought it, right? Want me to ask Dad for you?”</p>



<p>“I’ll do it sometime.”</p>



<p>Kotomi was always like this. I wasn’t sure if she didn’t like others entering her room or if she was embarrassed about her figures and tapestries, she avoided the question every time.</p>



<p>“So, what is it that you want to show me?”</p>



<p>“Um…”</p>



<p>Kotomi carefully approached the desk, making sure not to kick the cardboard boxes. She picked up two plushies – one with sharp red hair and determined eyes, the other with soft blue hair and a dreamy gaze.</p>



<p>“So, these are…”</p>



<p>“Are these Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan?”</p>



<p>“You get that!? Yes, exactly! This one is Hot Blood-chan, and this is Bit Hot-chan! Phew, I’m glad Haru-nii got it! With this, even Momoi-san should understand, right?”</p>



<p>“I get it, but… why are you so happy?”</p>



<p>She’d bought plushies of Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan, so knowing the character names was a given.</p>



<p>To my perplexed expression, Kotomi proudly declared, “I made these!”</p>



<p>“Really? You, Kotomi?”</p>



<p>“Yeah! I bought a DIY plush kit and attached matching face patches! The hairstyle was a bit tricky, but I’m confident I did well!”</p>



<p>“You really did a great job. I see, you made these. Momoi would be very happy too.”</p>



<p>Given her ecstatic reaction at the art exhibition, Momoi probably loved <em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em> even more than Kotomi did. An exclusive plushie like this would undoubtedly make her thrilled.</p>



<p>However, there was one thing that caught my attention.</p>



<p>“Why are Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan… naked?”</p>



<p>Although nudity didn’t occur in the original series, I wondered if Kotomi decided to create a bathing scene for her unique plushies. However, my assumption was off the mark.</p>



<p>“Here’s the thing…”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s expression clouded as she pulled out a crumpled piece of fabric from her desk drawer.</p>



<p>“And this is?”</p>



<p>“…Clothes.”</p>



<p>“Clothes?”</p>



<p>“More precisely, an one-piece dress.”</p>



<p>“This is supposed to be a dress…?”</p>



<p>“…It doesn’t look like a dress, right?”</p>



<p>“Well… yeah. I know you put a lot of effort into it, but it doesn’t quite resemble a ‘dress.’”</p>



<p>It resembled a crumpled handkerchief more than anything else.</p>



<p>Despite the eyes and hair being well-crafted, I couldn’t help but wonder why only the dress was of such questionable quality. I speculated that, unlike the plushie kit, this dress was an original creation by Kotomi herself.</p>



<p>“Didn’t the DIY plush kit come with clothes?”</p>



<p>“It did, and there were instructions too, but I really wanted to dress Bit Hot-chan in an one-piece dress…”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Wait a sec.”</p>



<p>Kotomi started fiddling with the computer, navigating to the official site of <em>Passionate Warrior Princess </em>and clicking on the campaign page.</p>



<p>“I wanted to recreate this…”</p>



<p>On the monitor, an illustration of the warrior heroines enjoying ice cream in front of a convenience store appeared. Hot Blood-chan wore a loose-fitting T-shirt and snug pants, while Bit Hot-chan was clad in a pure white one-piece dress.</p>



<p>“I was chatting with Momoi-san the other day, and she got excited about this clear file illustration… Momoi-san said the interaction between Hot Blood-chan and Bit Blood-chan is precious. That’s why I thought she would be happy if I gave her plushies recreating the same scene…”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s voice gradually wilted. While she managed to craft the eyes, mouth, and hair successfully, she struggled with the costume and lost her confidence.</p>



<p>“Please, Haru-nii, help me with the costume…”</p>



<p>This was the reason she reached out to me.</p>



<p>“Let me make it clear; I’m not good at crafts either.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… But, having Haru-nii’s help would be reassuring…”</p>



<p>I’d like to help in some way, but…</p>



<p>“…Does it absolutely have to be a plushie? If you want a unique gift, a novel would work, wouldn’t it?”</p>



<p>“A novel?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, remember the one you had me read back in your <em>chuunibyou</em><sup data-fn="d3248d15-1f90-4c8f-910c-f3f4b560bf0c" class="fn"><a href="#d3248d15-1f90-4c8f-910c-f3f4b560bf0c" id="d3248d15-1f90-4c8f-910c-f3f4b560bf0c-link">1</a></sup> days? The one where Fujisaki Kotomi gets transported to another world, showcases modern knowledge, and gets praised like crazy.”</p>



<p>Her face gradually turned red, her body was shaking.</p>



<p>“You… remember that?”</p>



<p>“I do. Where you have infinite stats, and you defeat some ridiculously powerful monster with a single blow, and you’re relentlessly pursued by handsome guys—”</p>



<p>“Aaaaaaah!”</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t scream suddenly. Dad’s gonna get mad.”</p>



<p>“F-Forget it! Forget it, forget it, <em>Beam</em>! Forget it, <em>Beam</em>!<sup data-fn="956bc33a-a032-4ac1-9564-e0e3645a48db" class="fn"><a href="#956bc33a-a032-4ac1-9564-e0e3645a48db" id="956bc33a-a032-4ac1-9564-e0e3645a48db-link">2</a></sup>”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010408.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Kotomi, with a blazing red face, mimicked the action of firing a gun. Back then, she had flaunted her writing and demanded me to read it, but now she looked incredibly flustered.</p>



<p>“If it’s that embarrassing, don’t force me to read it…”</p>



<p>“B-But, because I managed to write it well, I wanted someone to read it… Looking back, it was a totally chaotic story.”</p>



<p>“It wasn’t that bad. You wrote well enough that I could read it to the end. So, what do you call it? Fanfiction? What about giving <em>Passionate Warrior Princess’</em>s version as a present?</p>



<p>“N-No way! It’s embarrassing! A-And there might be misunderstandings if it’s fanfiction… Momoi-san would get angry…”</p>



<p>“That won’t happen. Momoi is nice. She won’t get upset if her friend worked hard for it.”</p>



<p>“D-Do you think so…?”</p>



<p>“I do. That’s why if you’ve put your heart into it, any kind of plushie will make her happy. If Momoi did the same for you, wouldn’t you be delighted?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah. I’d be really happy… I’d cherish it forever.”</p>



<p>Perhaps imagining the scene of receiving a plushie as a present, Kotomi smiled happily. Then, her expression turned serious.</p>



<p>“But, because Momoi-san is my precious friend… if possible, I want to give her the perfect plushie.”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s determination was unwavering. Making the plushie costume was a daunting task, and its usefulness remained uncertain. Still, the desire to present a one-of-a-kind plushie for her friend was admirable.</p>



<p>Moreover, Momoi was also my friend. If helping out could make a friend happy, I couldn’t just sit back.</p>



<p>“Alright. I’ll help you.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>Kotomi must had truly trusted me, as she had a bright smile on her face even though nothing had been resolved yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The next day, Saturday.</p>



<p>Around noon, having finished an early lunch, Kotomi and I took the train to the nearest shopping mall.</p>



<p>Our destination was a 100-yen store on the second-floor. The felt that was included in the plushie kit had run out while making the dress, that’s why we made this shopping trip.</p>



<p>“Do you think the 100-yen store has felt fabric?”</p>



<p>“They probably do.”</p>



<p>While not entirely sure, I vaguely recalled seeing fabric at the 100-yen store. If it wasn’t there, we could resort to online shopping. But Momoi’s birthday was only eight days away. Starting the crafting process early was essential since there wasn’t much time.</p>



<p>We took the escalator to the second floor and reached the 100-yen store. As we were wandering through the store, we stumbled upon the felt section.</p>



<p>Rows of cylindrical, colorful felt lined up before us. Kotomi sighed in relief. </p>



<p>“Thank goodness. They have plenty.”</p>



<p>“We can start working right away with these. Do you have enough colors?”</p>



<p>“Um… red for the shirt, black for the pants, and white for the dress…”</p>



<p>While saying this, Kotomi picked up red, black, and white felt.</p>



<p>“You’re going to make shoes too, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. It’ll be tough, but I want to pay attention to the details. I’ll make them hold soft-serve ice cream and wear panties, too. But… what color do you think, Haru-nii?”</p>



<p>“The underwear for Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan?”</p>



<p>She nodded, “There wasn’t a panty-shot scene in the original, so it’s up to our imagination. But it feels more authentic if we consider what color underwear they’d wear.”</p>



<p>While authenticity was essential, I’d rather not delve into panty discussions, even for plushies.</p>



<p>“Any color is fine, really.”</p>



<p>When I tried to casually end the subject, Kotomi shook her head.</p>



<p>“No way. We have to be meticulous about the colors! If Hot Blood-chan wears black panties, it would look weird! Mahorin would definitely frown!”</p>



<p>“I don’t get why she would frown… Do otakus dislike black panties or something?”</p>



<p>“We love them! Otakus love black panties! Because they’re sexy!”</p>



<p>“A-Alright, don’t make risqué remarks like that here.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was no one nearby, but such comments could lead to unnecessary misunderstandings if someone overheard. Upon my reprimand, Kotomi looked apologetic.</p>



<p>“Uh, sorry for getting so heated… But it’s an important detail for the fan-made plushie…”</p>



<p>“I get that you want to be meticulous. But, if otaku love black color, why not go with black?”</p>



<p>“N-No, that won’t work! Hot Blood-chan may look like cute girl, but she’s got a boyish personality inside! Black is sexy, and it’s just not her style!”</p>



<p>Kotomi whispered fervently and justified her stance. Not that it was directly related, but I understood her point. Indeed, if the innocent Takase wore black underwear, it would be somewhat surprising. Of course, it would still be acceptable, but…</p>



<p>“So, what color are you going with, then?”</p>



<p>“Um…”</p>



<p>Kotomi fell silent for a moment, then looked at me as if a brilliant idea had struck her.</p>



<p>“Do you know anyone among your acquaintances who’s like Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan?”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Well… do you know Kotobuki?”</p>



<p>“That tall Kotobuki?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that one. Kotobuki’s good-looking but has a bit of a tomboyish vibe, so she probably fit Hot Blood-chan. Also, do you know Aoki?”</p>



<p>“Aoki-san from the photography circle?”</p>



<p>“That’s the one. She always looks half-asleep, so I think she’s like Bit Blood-chan.”</p>



<p>“So, Kotobuki-san and Aoki-san… Uh, let’s see… I think I saw them wearing white and black?”</p>



<p>She likely referred to the colors of their underwear considering the context. I felt like I had accidentally stumbled into forbidden territory.</p>



<p>“How do you know this?”</p>



<p>“We shared the same changing room during swimming lesson. Kotobuki-san stands out, and Aoki-san once asked me if I wanted to join the Photography circle while we were changing. I declined, though…”</p>



<p>Aoki was the sole member of the photography circle and was recruiting new members to elevate it to a club. Despite the initial refusal, it seemed she hadn’t given up just yet.</p>



<p>“Anyway, Hot Blood-chan in white, and Bit Hot-chan in black. But is that okay? Bit Hot-chan doesn’t quite match the sexy vibe, does she?”</p>



<p>“Black undies on a shy girl has its charm because of the contrast.”</p>



<p>I didn’t quite get it, but if Kotomi was happy, then so be it.</p>



<p>“Now, onto buttons. Do you think we’ll find any?”</p>



<p>Yesterday, we debated whether to use velcro or snap buttons for the dress fastener, and buttons won in the end.</p>



<p>“Let’s check out the button section for now.”</p>



<p>Kotomi nodded and we wandered around the store until we spot snap buttons. As we made our way to the cashier, a tall girl emerged from the shelf’s corner.</p>



<p>“Hey, it’s the Fujisaki siblings.”</p>



<p>A girl with semi-long black hair tied in a ponytail was Kotobuki Ran. She was our classmate from last year and a member of the volleyball team. She was still in her uniform, possibly on her way back from club activities.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kotobuki. What a coincidence.”</p>



<p>“Why are you avoiding eye contact?”</p>



<p>“Just checking out that product over there.”</p>



<p>After the underwear discussion earlier, I felt awkward. </p>



<p>“A car supplies section? Fujisaki, you don’t even have a car.”</p>



<p>“Just curious. Don’t read too much into it.”</p>



<p>“Well, okay.”</p>



<p>However, Kotobuki looked more intrigued by what Kotomi held in her hands. </p>



<p>“So, you two are here for felt too?”</p>



<p>“Is that what you’re here for?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m making amulets for the club. It’s a tradition for the second years to make charms for the first years around this time every year.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like a hassle.”</p>



<p>“It really is. I’ve never been good at sewing, but since it’s an amulet, I can’t afford to mess it up too much.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki sighed, glancing between me and Kotomi.</p>



<p>“So, what are you making?”</p>



<p>“Clothes for plushies.”</p>



<p>I only knew Kotobuki as the ace of the volleyball team, but she was close to Takase and Momoi. They said that birds of a feather flock together, so if she was friends with those two, she probably wouldn’t tease us about making clothes for plushies.</p>



<p>When I honestly replied, Kotobuki raised her eyebrows in apparent admiration.</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s amazing. Making clothes for plushies is super difficult. Are you doing it, Fujisaki, or is it your sister?”</p>



<p>“Uh, well…”</p>



<p>Under Kotobuki’s towering figure, Kotomi, who was already shy around people, flinched. It would be rude to blatantly hide behind me, so she was standing next to me but keeping her face hidden, completely shrinking away.</p>



<p>Before I could answer, someone else spoke up.</p>



<p>“Ran-chan, sorry to keep you waiting!”</p>



<p>Takase rushed over, carrying a paper bag in her hand. She must have stopped by the bookstore. She greeted us with a smile.</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-kun and Fujisaki-san, huh? Are you shopping together? You’re so close~”</p>



<p>Like Kotobuki, Takase was in her uniform, probably because she had club activities in the morning. It was quite a rare sight to see Takase on a weekend.</p>



<p>“Are you shopping together too?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. She invited me after club activities. She said she’d treat me to cake if I helped her make an amulet.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Helping her?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m good at sewing!”</p>



<p>“For real?! You’re good at sewing!?”</p>



<p>“Wow, you’re giving me a perfect reaction! Yes, I’m quite skilled at it. I even received an award.”</p>



<p>“An award!? That’s awesome!”</p>



<p>“Haha, you’re too kind. But yeah, it was back in elementary school. I made a fabric picture book for a summer project and got praised in front of the whole school. It doesn’t seem like much now, though.”</p>



<p>Her cheeks colored with embarrassment as she humbly mentioned her award. </p>



<p>Though I hadn’t seen her work, receiving an award meant she did a good job. Moreover, she was about to teach sewing to Kotobuki.</p>



<p>This was a stroke of luck. If we learned from Takase, we could make quality clothes and also strengthen our bonds. Truly a two birds with one stone.</p>



<p>“I’ve got something to ask, Takase…”</p>



<p>“If it’s something I can help with, count me in,” Takase responded with a warm smile.</p>



<p>“I haven’t said anything yet.”</p>



<p>“Well, you helped me with studying, remember? That really saved me, so this is just returning the favor. What do you need help with?”</p>



<p>“If you’re up for it, I’d like you to teach Kotomi and me how to sew.”</p>



<p>“To both of you?” Takase looked a bit bewildered by the unexpected request.</p>



<p>I pointed to Kotomi’s hands and explained.</p>



<p>“We want to make outfits for plushies with this felt, but honestly, neither Kotomi nor I are good at sewing. It’d be a real lifesaver if you could teach us.”</p>



<p>Takase gave a thumb-up, “If that’s what you need, I’m happy to help.”</p>



<p>“Thanks a lot!”</p>



<p><em>Alright! Spending the day with Takase! The perfect start to an ideal day off!</em></p>



<p>But my excitement was cut short as Kotomi tugged at my shirt. While frowning slightly, she looked up at me.</p>



<p>…Oh, right, I completely forgot. We were supposed to visit Grandma’s place at 2 PM today. She’d be disappointed if neither of her grandchildren showed up. </p>



<p>Well, I could learn the tips from Takase and then teach Kotomi later.</p>



<p>“Kotomi has plans after this, so it’ll just be me learning.”</p>



<p>“Okay. What are your plans after this, Fujisaki-kun?”</p>



<p>“I don’t have any plans. What about you two?”</p>



<p>“We’re going for lunch now.”</p>



<p>“I see. In that case, I’ll head home for a bit. I need to bring plushies and stuff. What time and where should I meet you?”</p>



<p>“How about gathering at my place at 3 PM?”</p>



<p>Kotobuki’s house was a cozy café tucked away, just behind the Koigishi station and within walking distance.</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll be there at 3 PM.”</p>



<p>With the plan set, we finished our transaction and left the shopping mall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>And so, five minutes before our meeting, I strolled down the residential road behind the Koigishi station under the clear sky. As the humid air clung to my skin as I walked, a cozy café came into view across the street.</p>



<p>The exterior hinted at a combination of a shop on the first floor and a residence on the second. Trendy potted plants lined beneath the eaves, and standing next to them was a tall girl.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010416.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>It was Kotobuki. Clad in a white T-shirt and jeans, she fanned herself against the heat. I jogged over to her to avoid keeping her waiting.</p>



<p>“Sorry, did you wait long?”</p>



<p>“I just got here.”</p>



<p>“That’s good. Let’s head in.”</p>



<p>“About that, the café is packed today. All the tables are taken so we’ll be sewing in my room.”</p>



<p>“Is it okay for me to go to your room?”</p>



<p>Her tomboyish demeanor and boyish attire aside, Kotobuki was still a girl. I hadn’t seen her interacting much with guys since middle school. And considering the resistance some girls have to let the opposite gender into their rooms, I was hesitant.</p>



<p>“I’m not keen on guys entering, but I’ll make an exception for you here.”</p>



<p>“Because we went to the same middle school?”</p>



<p>“Not really, it’s because you’re Maho’s boyfriend. With such a cute girlfriend, you won’t get any weird ideas in my room.”</p>



<p>With a dismissive smile, she gestured for me to follow her toward the back. </p>



<p>I followed Kotobuki through the back door. The lively voices from the café echoed as we ascended the stairs and were directed to the corner room.</p>



<p>It was about ten tatami mats in size with a wooden floor. A simple room with a bed, a desk, a bookshelf, and a table. At the center of the room sat an angel.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re here!”</p>



<p>Takase, who had been tapping away on her phone, showed a bright smile. It seemed like she had come directly from the shopping mall, as she was still in her school uniform.</p>



<p>When I was entranced by her adorable smile, Takase beckoned me over.</p>



<p>“Come on, don’t just stand there. Sit down. No need to be shy!”</p>



<p>“You act like this is your room.”</p>



<p>“Well, I’ve visited many times. It’s practically my room.”</p>



<p>“My room, actually.” Kotobuki chuckled at Takase’s jest and said, “Feel free to sit anywhere.”</p>



<p>Around a square table, there was a half-empty glass on Takase’s side. The available spaces were by the desk and the bookshelf side. Since my distance to Takase would be the same no matter where I sat, I took a seat by the bookshelf.</p>



<p>“I’ll bring you something to drink, what would you like?”</p>



<p>There was orange juice in Takase’s hand, so Kotobuki must be asking me.</p>



<p>“Can I get an iced coffee?”</p>



<p>“Sure thing. I’ll throw in some cake too. It’s a bit sad to just have coffee, right?”</p>



<p>“Thanks!”</p>



<p>“Okay. Narumi, what kind of cake would you like?”</p>



<p>“I’ll take your recommendation, whatever that is!”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki exited the room, leaving Takase and I alone. Suddenly Takase leaned in as if wanting to share a secret. The abrupt proximity made my face heat up.</p>



<p>Even though she likely sweated during club activities, she smells really good…</p>



<p>“How’s it been with Maho-chi lately?”</p>



<p>“W-what do you mean?”</p>



<p>“I mean… kissing. Have you guys been kissing?”</p>



<p>Before I had been pretending to date Momoi, she initially planned to weave a web of lies to get through without introducing her nonexistent boyfriend to her friends. In the process, she created fictional scenarios like being called ‘Honey’ by her lover and engaging in PDA even in public. This led to a situation where I had to kiss Momoi on the cheek for the sake of consistency.</p>



<p>Momoi wasn’t here now, so there was no need for a kiss, but I had to maintain the illusion of our lovey-dovey relationship.</p>



<p>“We’re kissing a lot.”</p>



<p>“R-really? Good job.”</p>



<p>Though she asked herself, Takase blushed faintly, perhaps embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Why are you asking me, though?”</p>



<p>“It’s kind of awkward to ask Maho-chi directly.”</p>



<p>“Aren’t you two best friends?”</p>



<p>“We are, but it’s still hard to ask her. When I do, she dodges the question.”</p>



<p>“She dodges it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, she used to talk about kissing and hugging before. But ever since she introduced you, she started quickly changing the subject with ‘<em>We’re having a good time</em>.’”</p>



<p>Maybe it became awkward for her to maintain the lovey-dovey act once she introduced me, considering it wasn’t just a made-up story anymore. Or maybe she was preparing for a breakup.</p>



<p>The reason for the breakup would be a difference in values, and we had decided to split amicably. In this scenario, the story would be about transitioning from lovers to friends. Perhaps Momo was holding back from sharing romantic episodes.</p>



<p>If that was the case, maybe I should ease off on the lovey-dovey act as well…</p>



<p>“That’s why I thought things haven’t been going well lately, I’m worried…”</p>



<p>The girl I liked looked anxious. Although we hadn’t set a specific date for the breakup, I needed to maintain our close relationship to ease Takase’s worries.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, we’re doing fine.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. It’s just that, as you spend more time together, the initial excitement fades. Even if it looks like we’re affectionate to others, the feeling of being lovey-dovey diminishes. It’s not boredom, but it becomes hard to express it as anything other than ‘<em>we’re having a good time</em>.’”</p>



<p>“Is that how it is?”</p>



<p>“That’s how it is. You’ll understand when you’re in a relationship. Any plans for that?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I’m not interested in romance right now. I want to focus on my club activities.”</p>



<p><em>Phew.</em> It seemed like I could avoid a scenario where Takase got a boyfriend while I was dating Momoi. </p>



<p>Now, I should also try to understand her taste in guys. Fortunately, the conversation was steering toward love topics, so it wouldn’t be unnatural to ask.</p>



<p>“By the way, what kind of guys do you like, Takase?”</p>



<p>“I’ve never really thought about it… but someone kind, cheerful, who values family, I guess.”</p>



<p>“What about physical appearance?”</p>



<p>“Appearance, huh… someone tall and with a toned body would be cool.”</p>



<p><em>I see. A guy who’s tall and has a toned body…</em></p>



<p>“…That’s me.”</p>



<p>I blurted out without thinking. Takase laughed amusingly.</p>



<p>“Haha, that’s right. My type is you, Fujisaki-kun.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, I never expected to be your type, Takase.”</p>



<p>I replied casually, but I was secretly excited. As I was suppressing the urge to grin, Takase’s expression changed from a smile to a more serious one.</p>



<p>“But, you won’t tell anyone about what I just said, right? It would make Maho-chi uneasy if she hears it.”</p>



<p>“I know. I’ll keep it a secret.”</p>



<p>Of course, Momoi and I weren’t really dating. Even if she knew Takase’s preferences, she wouldn’t feel uneasy or jealous.</p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki returned. Seeing the cakes on the tray, Takase applauded, saying, “I’ve been waiting for this!”</p>



<p>“Here you go, Narumi, the cheesecake.”</p>



<p>“Yay! Thanks, Ran-chan!”</p>



<p>“And Fujisaki, shortcake, and a mandheling.”</p>



<p>“What’s mandheling?”</p>



<p>“It’s a strong coffee. I thought the bitterness would go well with cake.”</p>



<p>“That’s the best combination!”</p>



<p>I took the coffee and shortcake. She also provided milk and sugar, but I’d enjoy it black for now.</p>



<p>I sipped the coffee from the cold glass, and as it touched my lips, a robust bitterness spreads. The aroma was intense, as if putting me in a coffee-drinking mood. The aftertaste was bitter which resulted in enhancing the sweetness of the cake.</p>



<p>It was the perfect combination, so I decided to stick with a black coffee.</p>



<p>“Delicious! Ran-chan’s cakes are the best!”</p>



<p>“I’m glad you like them.”</p>



<p>“I want to marry Ran-chan and have unlimited cake everyday!”</p>



<p>Thank goodness Kotobuki was a girl. She was tall and toned, if she were a guy, she’d be my strongest rival.</p>



<p>“Now, shall we begin?”</p>



<p>As we enjoyed coffee and cake, Kotobuki brought up the main topic. </p>



<p>I took out sewing tools from my bag and laid them out on the table. When I pulled out plushies, Kotobuki suddenly noticed something.</p>



<p>“By the way, I forgot to ask earlier, but is that yours?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s for Kotomi.”</p>



<p>Since Momoi was a closet otaku, I couldn’t reveal it was a birthday present for her. </p>



<p>But, come to think of it, it would be awkward to give it to her at the birthday party. If I put it in a bag and said <em>“Open it later,” </em>maybe that would work? I hadn’t been invited to the birthday party yet, but I should ask Kotomi later about the plan.</p>



<p>“Sewing for your sister, huh?”</p>



<p>Kotobuki looked impressed. I nodded my head.</p>



<p>“Yeah, though what I make is more like a prototype. I’ll learn the ropes here and then teach Kotomi later.”</p>



<p>Otherwise, it wouldn’t become a present from Kotomi but from me. I also had to prepare my present for Momoi, but the plushie took precedence.</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-kun, you’re really family-oriented.”</p>



<p>“Looks really can be deceiving.”</p>



<p>Being praised by the girls, I felt a bit embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Have you decided what kind of clothes you’re making?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, Kotomi made a request.”</p>



<p>I fiddled with my phone and showed them an image on a clear file.</p>



<p>Although Kotomi didn’t openly admit her otaku side, that was mainly due to a lack of opportunities or someone to share it with. She allowed me to bring the plushies, and unlike Momoi, she didn’t intend to hide it. Momoi was just overly concerned, but I doubted either of them held any bias against otaku.</p>



<p>“These characters are Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan… I’d like to recreate not only the costume but also the shoes and ice cream if possible.”</p>



<p>Takase, who was earnestly looking at the image, nodded confidently.</p>



<p>“I can handle something like this.”</p>



<p>“As expected, I’m counting on you, Takase!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah. You can rest assured. So, did you bring the fabric marker?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I brought it.”</p>



<p>“Then, let’s start by making the pattern.”</p>



<p>“What about me?”</p>



<p>“What kind of amulet do you want to make, Ran-chan?”</p>



<p>“Umm… this one.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki took a piece of paper from a drawer and placed it on the table. Looks like the club members had been brainstorming design together, as the paper had a drawing of the amulet.</p>



<p>It was designed like a volleyball uniform, with the name on the front and a volleyball on the back.</p>



<p>“Ran-chan, you should start with the fabric marker for the pattern too.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Fujisaki, can I borrow the marker?”</p>



<p>“Feel free to use it. By the way, how long are we working today?”</p>



<p>It depended on how clumsy Kotobuki was, but considering the workload, I had more things to do. If we disbanded once Kotobuki finished her part, I would end up stopping midway.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry if you have to stop halfway, but I can’t let a guy stay over. How long will you stay, Narumi?”</p>



<p>“I’m not pressed for time, but I think Fujisaki-kun’s clothes can be done by 7pm.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“In that case, let me stay around until 7pm”</p>



<p>“Sure, consider it a perk of being in the same school.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad I’m from West Koigishi Middle School.”</p>



<p>“It was a good school. They have an indoor pool and spacious gym. Well, the school anthem was weird, though.”</p>



<p>“I know. They chanted ‘mountain’ a lot.”</p>



<p>“Even though there are no mountains nearby.”</p>



<p>“There probably were in the past—”</p>



<p>“Hey, you two, focus on your work!”</p>



<p>Takase playfully scolded us, and we got back to our works.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“I’m back!”</p>



<p>It was around 7 PM when I returned home.</p>



<p>Looks like my parents were already back, as the house was brightly lit. Although I’d love to dive into dinner right away, I had to report the results first.</p>



<p>I climbed the stairs and headed to my sister’s room. After a few knocks, Kotomi quickly opened the door.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Haru-nii.”</p>



<p>“I’m home. How was Grandma?”</p>



<p>“She was doing well. I even got some pocket money.”</p>



<p>“Make sure to use it wisely.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, your share is with Mom.”</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll call Grandma later to say thank you.”</p>



<p>“She’ll be happy. She’s been wanting to see you, Haru-nii.”</p>



<p>“We haven’t met in a while. I’ll drop by during the summer break.”</p>



<p>Kotomi smiled, and then hesitated. She looked at me with a bit of worry. “How did the clothes turn out?”</p>



<p>“I think I did well.”</p>



<p>I took the plushies out of my bag. They were Hot Blood-chan and Bit Hot-chan, dressed exactly as Kotomi had requested.</p>



<p>“Wow, Haru-nii, this is amazing! The costume looks just like those sold in stores!”</p>



<p>Kotomi was ecstatic as she admired the perfectly finished outfit.</p>



<p>“Wait, what happened to your finger!?”</p>



<p>When I was about to hand over the plushie, Kotomi’s expression suddenly changed. A band-aid was wrapped around my left thumb, with a faint trace of blood seeping through.</p>



<p>“Oh, this? I accidentally pricked myself a bit with the needle.”</p>



<p>“I-I’m so sorry…”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not a deep cut.”</p>



<p>“But it must’ve hurt, right?”</p>



<p>“Just a quick sting. More importantly, Kotomi, be careful not to injure yourself. Attaching buttons is seriously tricky.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah. I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>“Good. Here, take this.”</p>



<p>After handing the plushies to Kotomi, she peered underneath Bit Hot-chan, “…No panties!”</p>



<p><em>She’s checking that first, huh…?</em></p>



<p>“I was a bit hesitant to ask Takase for tips on making underwear. Well, compared to the costume, it’s should be easier. I’ve got the hang of it so rest assured.”</p>



<p>“Yeah! Thanks, Haru-nii! I’ll definitely make it perfectly!”</p>



<p>Kotomi declared her determination while hugging the plushies to her chest.</p>
