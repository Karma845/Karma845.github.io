<h3>Chapter 1: Mimori Yui is Not New To This</h3>

<p>I secretly admire those guys who can casually talk to girls. Because it means they have never had unpleasant experiences with girls before.</p>

<p>In my case, it's impossible for me. I've been attending high school for over a year, and I hardly have any memories talking to other girls. Who said high school life is like rose life? It's more like a life in the mud.</p>

<p>...So, why am I suddenly thinking about this? Well, it's because I'm currently facing such a situation.</p>

<p>After school, in front of the school gate.</p>

<p>I was watching a certain female student from a distance with a bitter expression on her face.</p>

<p>This incident started just a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>After school, I had made plans to meet with a Kouhai of mine and I'm waiting at the front gate. As the students began to leave, I was looking for that Kouhai's figure... but then I froze at the sight of a beautiful girl a little away from the other students.</p

<p>That girl was, of course, same school as me... and she was incredibly cute. I was irresistibly drawn to her gaze.</p>

<p>Her clear eyes are so captivating, and her pure whie skin shines beautifully because of the twilight. Her medium-length brown hair, fastened with a hairpin, falls smoothly, igniting a desire to touch it. And her ample chest is noticeable even from a distance.</p>

<p>I was shocked to discover that such a girl existed in this school, and she looked so delicate.</p>

<p>The girl was looking around as if searching for something. Perhaps she had dropped something. Although there was no sign of agitation or panic on her face, she seemed serious about it.</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>I thought she would find it right away, but several minutes passed, and she was still searching. If she was in trouble, I wouldn't mind to lend a hand, but that would bring me back to the initial problem, talking to another girl.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I have to talk to her after all...&quot;</p>

<p>Honestly, it feels like I'm being forced to play a impossible game.</p>

<p>The person in front of me clearly seems like a female student who has many friends and enjoying her school life. On the other hand, I'm the type of guy who mostly forgotten by my classmates always asking me with their serious expression, &quot;Sorry, what's your name again?&quot; It's strange, isn't it? It's already June and we've been in the same class for two months. I even clearly remember your name, Takahashi-kun.</p>

<p>But when it comes to cute girls, I always became more cautious. We came from different worlds, so even if I approach them, they'll just find me annoying.</p>

<p>...Oh, geez! This is so troublesome. Whatever, I'll figure it out!</p>

<p>&quot;Um... excuse me. Are you looking for something, by any chance?&quot;</p>

<p>After confirming that we are in the same grade, I spoke up.</p>

<p>The girl momentarily froze at my words. She turned to face me, and I held my breath.</p>

<p>She's really cute. Just being closer to her increases her impact like this. And she has a big chest. In my class, there's no girl this big... No, what am I thinking?!</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to be searching for something. If you're in trouble, I'd like to help.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl tilted her head slightly, her expression bewildered, and slowly moved her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;...Could it be, you want to do something naughty with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Her sweet voice sounded innocent, but I couldn't understand the meaning of her words at all.</p>

<p>For a while, we stared at each other in silence... until the girl burst into a small giggle.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha. Sorry, it's nothing. It was a boring joke wasn't it? Forget about it.&quot;</p>

<p>No, no, no, no! That question is completely unexpected. There's no way I can forget that without resolving that questions first... Though I eventually removed that thought and responded with &quot;Uh, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We got distracted, didn't we? Did you approach me because you thought I was in trouble?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you seemed like you were searching for something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. But sorry, I want to search on my own, so it's okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I've been rejected... But at least I wasn't blatantly rejected. I know I'm being overly timid, but I really struggle with outgoing girls like her.</p>

<p>&quot;I see... I'm sorry too. I was being meddlesome. I hope you find what you're looking for.&quot;</p>

<p>Since she insists on doing it alone, it's probably not something important that she lost.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to go to the meeting place with my Kouhai, it happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, there's something I want to say. Is it okay?... You don't have any friends, do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?! Uhh...&quot;</p>

<p>How did she figure it out? She's like a master detective... No, wait.</p>

<p>It felt like being bitten by a stray dog when I tried to help it. I felt a bit irritation, thinking it was quite rude... However, that anger quickly deflated.</p>

<p>Because the girl had such a lovely smile on her face.</p>

<p>I didn't point it out because I have grudge or sarcasm, but, I couldn't help but to let it slip. Her smile was a perfect match for such an expression.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00007.jpeg">

<p>&quot;But, I was happy with your concern. Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.......... Mmn.&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow, I felt the irritation drain away... In the end, the question of &quot;Do you want to do something naughty with me?&quot; remained a mystery. Maybe she was just messing up with me, but she was a mysterious girl.</p>

<p>...However, I can't help but to wonder a little.</p>

<p>What would have happened if I had nodded in agreement to that question... But well, it's pointless to think about it because it could never happen.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Kouhai I was waiting for arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Senpaiii... Who's this~?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a soft voice of a girl come from behind. At the same time, my eyes were not covered by hands because of certain reason.</p>

<p>In fact, even if she successfully covered my eyes, I definitely can guess who it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Good job, Suzune. By the way, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>I turned around and gave her a stern look. There my Kouhai stood, who was trying to sneak up on me on tiptoes and trembling but unfortunately unable to reach me due to the height difference.</p>

<p>She failed her attempt to play a prank.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe... Good job, senpai. You look tired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't try to hide it with a smile. It's because of your height, you failed so miserably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G-Geez. It's okay to fall for your Kouhai's pranks once in a while, right?&quot;</p>

<p>She had semi-long, orange hair tied with a ribbon. Her eyes were big with still hint of innocence, and her pouting expression as she turned away was incredibly adorable.</p>

<p>She was my only Kouhai, Suzune Futaba, standing behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for the wait, senpai. Well then, let's get started, shall we?&quot;</p>

<p>From now on, I will go to choose a gift store together with Suzune for Father's Day, which was a few weeks away.</p>

<p>According to Suzune, she didn't know the preferences of men, so she wanted my advice. But I wasn't confident about how much help I could be as a high school student.</p>

<p>Just before we started walking, I glanced back for a moment.</p>

<p>The girl I saw earlier was no longer there. I wondered if she found what she was looking for or if she was searching in another place. Hoping it was still in the same place.</p>

<p>I was about to continue walking when Suzune, walking beside me, said,</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't expect my hand to not reach you... I'll come up with something that will surprise you next time, senpai. Just you wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, even if you asked &quot;Who's this~?, it wouldn't make any difference. In this school, the only girl I'm close to is you, Suzune, so it would be obvious in an instant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Now that you mention it.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't want her to agree so readily.</p>

<p>&quot;Senpai, it seems like even when you became a second-year student, you still don't have many friends. But the fact that you're not concerned about it, is very much like you, I don't hate it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah. Having many friends or having a girlfriend, those things are all irrelevant to me. Honestly, I don't even have expectations for my next life.&quot;</p>

<p>In reality, I determine my own worth. I may have few friends and no girlfriend, but I am reasonably satisfied with my life.</p>

<p>...No, it's not just pretending. I'm being serious.</p>

<p>Because it's easier to give up and accept the fact that some hopes are unattainable than to cling to them.</p>

<p>For example, even if I wanted a girlfriend, it would require a tremendous amount of effort and time to achieve that goal. And there's always the possibility that all that effort would go to waste.</p>

<p>In that case, it's easier for me to give up and accept that having a girlfriend is impossible, no getting hurt.</p>

<p>In short, I'm a successful non-riajuu guy. (TL: Riajuu = Normie)</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>As I looked, Suzune, who had been silent until now, had a innocent smile on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;You say you don't have expectations for your next life, but did you forget that you have an adorable Kouhai who admires you? ...Just that alone would make many people envy you, most likely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since you can said that so lightly, that means...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Of course, I was just joking! Don't take it so seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, thanks for encouraging me. I'm aware that I'm leading a dull youth. Even earlier, when I approached that girl who was searching for something, I was quite nervous.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There were indeed students like that... Wait, wait a minute. So, the person you talked to is Mimori Yui-san, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I involuntarily stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori Yui...? Suzune, do you know about that female student?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? W-Well, I wouldn't say I know her... But, she's a famous person at Sakurazaki High School, you know? I didn't think you wouldn't know her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? But I don't recall ever hearing name Mimori Yui. What kind of girl is she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, well...&quot;</p>

<p>What's going on? She suddenly started fidgeting.</p>

<p>How much did she need to struggle with this? With a slight blush on her cheeks, Suzune said,</p>

<p>&quot;Senpai, could you... crouch down a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? Like this?&quot;</p>

<p>As I crouched down, I felt a soft breath near my ear.</p>

<p>Suzune leaned closer, as if we were sharing a secret.</p>

<p>&quot;...Please don't think of Mimori-san as a immoral girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori-san... If you ask her, she'll do anything naughty, that's her famous reputation, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>...Huh?</p>

<p>&quot;What?! Are you kidding me? That girl?! That means she's&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, don't say any more than that! That's not a nice way to put it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ah, yeah. Sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, my friends have told me that Mimori-san is that kind of girl! Even for me, it was embarrassing to say something like that!&quot;</p>

<p>Flustered Suzune tried to explain it, but I was too confused to respond.</p>

<p>The only thing I remember is, she's teasing me, then...</p>

<p>'--Could it be, you want to do something naughty with me?'</p>

<p>So she's really that kind of girl, that's why she asked me that question?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, are those rumors are really true? I can't quite believe it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh........ You're still going on about her?&quot;</p>

<p> Suzune's cheeks we're dyed by the sunset. Come to think of it, Suzune is not really good at this kind of conversation since she just graduate in middle school... I'm really sorry, Suzune.</p>

<p> &quot;I don't know the details either, but I've heard she got entangled herself in some dangerous things in another prefecture. Or relieving the teachers to get the key answers, something like that rumors.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;That's an epic episode.......&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;There are also rumors that Mimori-san is so rich that it is hard to believe she is a high school student, but that is because she receives allowance from a man she doesn't know......&quot;</p>

<p>  Isn't that a pretty bad...... That kind of thing called &quot;sugar daddies&quot; right?</p>

<p> &quot;The school seems to be aware of the rumors about her, and it seems that she is often scolded by disciplinary committee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The discipline committee? Indeed, I have the image of them cracking down on things like improper relationships between opposite sexes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're that famous? It seems like they've been doing that sort of thing since long time ago. My acquaintance who's an upperclassman says they're the worst kind of girls. It's well-known among everyone at school.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, it's difficult not to have a negative impression of female students who sell their bodies to anyone. But still, I think it's harsh to call them the worst.</p>

<p>&quot;So, please be careful, okay? If you get too close to Mimori, people around you will misunderstand... Even seniors think that way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>Without even being told, I understood what Suzune was worried about. If I try to get close to Mimori, I'll be seen as a guy with ulterior motives. So it means I shouldn't get involved.</p>

<p>Come to think of it... When Mimori was looking for something, none of the other students offered to help. Does that mean nobody wanted to get involved her?</p>

<p>...It's just how things are sometimes.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00008.jpeg">

<p>&quot;Don't worry, I won't become friends with Mimori. Actually, I can't become friends with her. Our worlds are completely different.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's true.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune's smile seemed somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>Yes, if the rumors are true, Mimori Yui is a girl who is good ay dealing with guys. Even if a plain guy like me tries to talk to a girl like her, it'll just be annoying and end there.</p>

<p>Because that's how it is. It's presumptuous to expect me to become close with the opposite sex.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... I'm sorry, Senpai. You helped me, but I still couldn't make up my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It can't be helped. I couldn't give you a good opinion either.&quot;</p>

<p>I comforted Suzune, who looked downcast in front of the ticket gate at the station.</p>

<p>As expected, it's difficult to match the preferences of a man like her father, and I couldn't find anything that clicked.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, there were quite expensive items... Alright. Since we're already here, I'll save up some more money and give it another try!&quot;</p>

<p>As we were about to pass through the ticket gate together, I suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't find my commuter pass... weird, why...&quot;</p>

<p>Then, I suddenly realized.</p>

<p>My commuter pass is place in a notebook with a pass case, and today I written down gift ideas in the notebook. I think I left it on my desk...</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Suzune! I think I left it at school. It's already late, so could you go home ahead of me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... That's shame, but thank you for helping me today. Oh, and Senpai!&quot;</p>

<p>Just like a puppy wagging its tail, Suzune waved her hand from the other side of the ticket gate.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't forget, okay! I failed with 'Who's this?' this time, but I'll come up with something that will surprise you next time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'll be looking forward to it.&quot;</p>

<p>I parted ways with Suzune and headed towards the school. It would take about 20 minutes from the station.</p>

<p>By the time I arrived at the school, it was already past 6:30.</p>

<p>&quot;There it is... Somehow, I made it in time before the school closed.&quot;</p>

<p>I searched for my desk in the classroom and took out my notebook. Now all that was left was to go home.</p>

<p>I walked out into the hallway, casually gazing at the outside scenery on my way back. The school building was in a horseshoe shape, and the courtyard could be seen from the windows. In the dimly lit courtyard, there were only a few students. Well, that's natural, considering the time... they must be the ones who stayed behind after club activities.....</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>For a brief moment, my thoughts stop..</p>

<p>Under the gradually turning azure sky, there was a solitary female student searching for something. There was no mistaking it. It was the same girl I spoked to for the first time just a few hours ago.</p>

<p>It was Mimori Yui.</p>

<p>Could it be that she had been searching all this time, even until now?</p>

<p>It didn't make any sense. Without thinking, I hurriedly walked into the courtyard, and there, Mimori was still squatting down, peering into the flowerbed with an expressionless face.</p>

<p>This wasn't the time to be nervous about talking to a girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you still searching? It's been two hours since school ended.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori looked up at me, her eyes widening with a curious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;I was surprised. You're still at school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's my line, I thought you'll eventually give up if you couldn't find it, since you're refusing for help. If it's that important, you should have said so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You'd better not bother with me. Look, those guys over there.&quot;</p>

<p>As I looked, several male students were looking at us and having a conversation. I couldn't make out the exact words, but the words I could hear were nothing but peaceful. &quot;Is he into Mimori?&quot; or &quot;Is he really? No way?&quot; or even &quot;A horny monkey with excess sexual desire.&quot; Well, the last one is rude.</p>

<p>I see. So this is what it means for getting involved with Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like Suzune said. Talking to Mimori Yui attracts attention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, well. If you get involved with me, people around me will get the wrong idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's certainly a hassle. But... if you're okay with it, should I help you? You're searching for something, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori froze completely at my offer.</p>

<p>When I first approached her, Mimori said she was fine on her own. I think she said that because she was considerate of me, someone who didn't know anything about her situation. If I were to help Mimori, it would lead to misunderstandings among the other students.</p>

<p>If the rumors are true, that she's troublemaker. But one thing I can say for sure is that she's probably a good person.</p>

<p>&quot;It would leave a much worse aftertaste to ignore someone in need. But if you still don't want it, I won't force you.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori remained silent, simply gazing at me. Eventually...</p>

<p>&quot;...I'll ask just in case, but are you expecting some kind of reward or trying to get something in return by helping me here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, no! I was just joking, I don't think you're like that at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori stood up and frantically waved her hands as if in a panic.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um... I think you should really not getting involve with me after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no big deal. It would be worse to ignore someone in trouble. So, what did you drop?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...My phone. I'm certain I dropped it outside the school building.&quot;</p>

<p>It was more important than I imagined... I have to stay at school until this late to search for it.</p>

<p>&quot;That's unfortunate... By the way, is your phone on silent mode?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have it on silent mode at school, why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you searched while it was ringing, it might be a lit a light making it easier to find. Here, this is my phone. Although it might be pointless if it doesn't ring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see! No, it's definitely not pointless. Hey, what's your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tokami Riku.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, huh... I'll remember your name. Thanks, I'm glad you're here.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori smiled... and my heart skipped a beat. Damn it, why am I getting flustered? I should really stop seeing Mimori as opposite sex. But now, that I know what kind of girl she is, it can't be helped right?</p>

<p>After that, Mimori and I walked around the school ground. She were certain that she dropped it outdoors, but we couldn't narrow down the exact location. Occasionally, we would catch students returning from club activities staring at us oddly, but I ignored them completely.</p>

<p>Moreover, the real issue was when there were no other students around. After all, it was already dark outside, and there we, a boy and a girl who had just met.</p>

<p>If I were Mimori, I would feel not just awkward but terrified as well in this situation.</p>

<p>What should I do? Maybe I should bring up a topic to lighten the mood... Oh, no, that's a bad one. It's the usual one where the guy try too hard and end up going staying silent....</p>

<p>&quot;By any chance, are you thinking that being alone with a guy like you might be scary?&quot; Mimori suddenly said, causing my shoulders to jump.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, a psychic?&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;It was written all over your face. It's easy to see you're a bit nervous. But don't worry, I trust you to some extent, Riku-kun. Because when we first met, you looked bewildered when I asked you a question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A question...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whether you want to do naughty things with me,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Don't say it so bluntly...</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wanted to see your reaction. If you had gotten flustered or made excuses, it would have been a problem. I've seen plenty of guys with ulterior motives before.&quot;</p>

<p>Ulterior motives, huh. She's probably used to being approached by guys like that.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I thought that you genuinely cared about me. Besides, if you knew about the rumors surrounding me, you wouldn't have approached me in the midst of all those students.&quot;</p>

<p>I see... So, um, that phrase about not having any friends...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This person doesn't usually talk to anyone, so he don't know anything about me,&quot; she said. &quot;After being at this school for a year, you should at least know my face and name, right? But you didn't. How's that for deduction?&quot;</p>

<p>Damn, it hit the nail on the head so accurately! But I wish she would have wrapped it in a bit more subtlety. It felt like a direct hit without any padding, almost like an insult.</p>

<p>As I kept staring at her, Mimori smiled softly and said,</p>

<p>&quot;We're quite a pair, aren't we?... I understand how you feel because I'm a loner too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>It's strange, but I can't seem to get angry at her. It's like I can't sense any ill intentions from her.</p>

<p>...It was at that moment.</p>

<p>In the corner of my eye, I spotted something emitting a dazzling light within the bushes, and my heart skipped a beat.</p>

<p>It was a good thing it was nighttime. The illuminated screen of the ringing phone stood out so much.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori, look!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmn...? Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori hurriedly ran towards the bushes. How happy she must have been. Picking up the smartphone, Mimori let out a sigh of relief, patting her chest.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so relieved... Riku-kun, thank you so much. I almost given up, thinking it was hopeless, and it was right here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad you found it. Oh, you don't have to return my phone just yet. If it stays there, you won't be able to feel at ease right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Can't feel at ease?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The call history. My phone still has your contact number saved, so please delete the history. I mean, it's unpleasant to have some unknown guy knowing your number, right? It might make you feel uneasy.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori was momentarily stunned, and then she burst into giggles.</p>

<p>&quot;W-What's so funny?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's nothing. I just realized that You're probably isn't used to dealing with girls. Most people wouldn't be bothered by something like that. Well, it might be bother if it's other people but, you help me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not used to it...&quot; Well, I suppose that's true.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why you don't have to worry about the phone number. I'll return it as it is....But before that, I have to thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>Uhh, thank you? Ah, I wonder if she'll treat me to a can of coffee or something.</p>

<p>As I tilted my head in confusion, Mimori unbuttoned her school uniform's top button.</p>

<p>Snap! She took a photo of the contents inside her clothes with my phone.</p>

<p>&quot;W-Wait...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here, this is for helping me. I'd be happy if you're pleased with it.&quot;</p>

<p>My eyes involuntarily drifted toward Mimori's chest. A clearly defined, ample bosom. Judging by the position of the phone, it will undoubtedly capture her body precisely.</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, no! I appreciate the sentiment, but this isn't appropriate! You're a girl, so stop doing something like that so casually...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine, it's fine. I'm just grateful to you. Well then, bye-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori smiled and walked away. I remained stunned, gazing at her back... Eventually, as if she had something else to say, Mimori turned around.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-kun. Thank you so much today. Thanks to you, I found something important.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's not really a big deal. Lending someone a phone is something anyone can do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not true. I'm sure I couldn't have find it without your help,&quot; Mimori said, with a sincere smile.</p>

<p>The smile she wore was real.</p>

<p>&quot;Throughout the day, everyone ignored me because they didn't want to get involved with me. Maybe that was the right thing to do, but you were the only one who reached out to me. So, it's not something anyone can do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... If you says so, I'll accept your gratitude sincerely. You're welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmn...&quot; she nodded.</p>

<p>Mimori smiled and walked away, leaving me behind.</p>

<p>Just a while ago, I was talking to a famous person at school, but it felt unreal. However, it was clear that Mimori was polite and a good person. It was hard to believe the rumors about her lacking chastity is true.</p>

<p>Well, there is one thing, though.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori is somewhat amazing,&quot; I muttered, directing my gaze to the phone that likely have that photo of Mimori. Did she do it because she's is accustomed to such things?</p>

<p>...Come to think of it, I couldn't ask the one thing I was most curious about from her.</p>

<p>Is it true that she'll have intimate relationship with anyone...? Welp, there's no way I could ask her that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning, just after entering the classroom, I noticed something strange. Some students were having conversation while looking at me. The boys had curious expressions, while the girls seemed to be nastily looking at me.</p>

<p>What's going on? What the heck...?</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Tokami, right? Can I talk to you for a moment?&quot; Takahashi called out to me as I took my seat. He was the guy I asked before and replied to me with, &quot;Sorry, who are you again?&quot; But it seems he remembered my name. It made me a little happy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, sure, what's up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I just heard a rumor about you a little while ago, Tokami. Did you really hook up with Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>Thud. I forcefully hit my head against the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;...There's no way. Mimori, you mean Mimori Yui, right? How could that happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's what I thought. It's hard for you to make a move on girl like her. Hahaha.&quot; Takahashi laughed.</p>

<p>I see, so he remembered my name because of the rumors. In other words, if nothing like this happened, I'll be forgotten...again.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you know, it was trending in our class group chat yesterday. They said that Mimori and you were talking and getting along well. And then, since it was late, they started speculating that you guys went to a hotel or something.&quot;</p>

<p>That's going too far... No, from the perspective of my classmates, it might be possible. After all, we're talking about this famous girl Mimori Yui.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, I knew about Mimori's reputation, but I never expected it to become such a hot topic so quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;That was just a casual conversation with Mimori. We're not friends or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah, that makes sense. Tokami and Mimori have completely different personalities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, to be honest, I wanted to ask you... Is that rumor about Mimori true?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you mean the promiscuous one? I don't know if it's real. But I've heard quite few nasty rumors about her.&quot;</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded by their nonchalant remarks.</p>

<p>Is it really true? Mimori, really?</p>

<p>&quot;For example, Manaka. Apparently she's victim of Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Manaka?&quot;</p>

<p>I shifted my gaze towards Manaka, who was chatting with her friends in the distance.</p>

<p>&quot;So, like, we went to the club with Kei and others, and it was super lit! There were these laser-like things flying around, so I quickly took some photos and posted them on Instagram and I got tons of likes!&quot;</p>

<p>With her wavy, fashionable hair and heavy makeup, I couldn't help but notice her distinct style. Manaka and I had seats fairly close to each other, so I remembered her face quite well.</p>

<p>She had more of a &quot;gyaru&quot; vibe. Honestly, she was the type of girl I least preferred.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that Mimori stole Manaka's boyfriend. And when it got exposed, Manaka and her boyfriend broke up. Apparently, Manaka went mad and confronted Mimori. She was like, 'Are you trying to steal my boyfriend, you damn bitch?!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mimori is the only one who can stand up to fight her like that. I've heard she has some gangster guys backing her up. You never know what they might do if you mess with her.&quot;</p>

<p>As I stood there dumbfounded, Takahashi let out a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori may have beautiful face, but it's a disappointment when you see what she's really like. Is any guy fine for her?&quot;</p>

<p>Vividly recalling Mimori's smile, my chest tightened.</p>

<p>The Mimori Yui I knew was completely different from the girl even Suzune was gossiping about. And somewhere deep in my heart, there was a part of me that wished those rumors were wrong.</p>

<p>...This is ridiculous. Why do I have to worry about something like this?</p>

<p>It was just a few minutes helping her. That's the end of our relationship.</p>

<p>There's no point in me thinking about that girl.</p>

<p>After that, it was a typical day. The class began, I paid decent attention, and everything ended without incident. Using my phone during the short breaks is my routine. And then, I received a call.</p>

<p>A phone call at this time? I looked at the screen, and there were four letters displayed. (TL: 水-守-結-衣)</p>

<p>It was Mimori Yui.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh? I didn't saved her number though, How...?&quot;</p>

<p>What is this, magic trick? I hurriedly went out to the balcony of the classroom and answered the call in a secluded corner. This way, no one should overhear my conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you picked up. Um, it's Mimori. Are you okay now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm fine... But, more importantly, I saw 'Mimori' on my screen earlier. Did you register your number on my phone yesterday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was planning to call you again, Riku-kun. But isn't it scary to receive a call from an unknown number?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For me, it's more nerve-wracking to receive a call from a girl... If you're going to register your number, atleast let me know. I need to prepare myself mentally too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mental preparation, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exchanging contact information with someone of the opposite sex is a big deal for me. Until now, only my mom and a Kouhai from school knew my number.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, I'll be the third person then... it's like Ayanami Rei-chan&quot;</p>

<p>She even know such old anime reference. (TL: Ayanami Rie from Evangelion. Have 3 Incarnation: Rei 1, Rei 2, Rei 3. Watch it, once you understand the story it's pure depression haha.)</p>

<p>&quot;If you only want, would you like to have lunch together today? It's a bit troublesome to be seen so... Maybe in one of the unused rooms in the club building?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lunch, with you? Why all of a sudden...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to thank you properly once again. You found my lost phone, and no matter how many times I say thank you, it won't be enough. If it's hassle, it's okay, you don't need come. Just come if you feel like it, bye-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, wait--&quot;</p>

<p>She hung up... Lunch, with her, huh?</p>

<p>I thought I would never see her again, but it looks like we're going to meet again soon. I'm happy, but I have no idea what to talk about with a girl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the lunch break, as promised, I head towards the club building next to the gym. I still have some worries about getting impression as a boring person, but it's a kind invitation, so I'll accept it graciously.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori, it's me. Can I come in?&quot;</p>

<p>As I called out in front of the unused club room, the door opened gently.</p>

<p>Mimori, with wide eyes, peeked through the door at me.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm surprised. You really came.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you're the one who invited me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true, but I thought I wouldn't mind if you didn't come. It's quite troublesome to be seen with me after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I was immediately asked if I went to hotel with Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine, really. I don't want to refuse a meal just because of such reason, and I'm more worried about saying something strange and scaring you away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hmm, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>As we entered the club room, Mimori placed a doorstopper on the door.</p>

<p>&quot;There might be other students coming in here, but if it's locked, it's logical to them that someone might using it. So, you don't have to worry, no one will see us.&quot;</p>

<p>Though hearing that, someone like me gets more nervous instead.</p>

<p>&quot;If you'd like, have some of these.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori placed a bag from Mister Donut on the seat.</p>

<p>Inside were about six colorful donuts.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, you bought this many?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted to show my gratitude to you. If you don't like sweets, you can take them home and give them to someone else. Oh, but leave the Pon de Ring for me. That's my favorite.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you wanted some too... Then, thank you. I'll gratefully accept them.&quot;</p>

<p>I actually quite like sweet things, so I'm genuinely happy.</p>

<p>&quot;But, this time, it's good that we're having a proper thank-you moment. That photo from yesterday was way beyond my expectations... And, in the end, I haven't seen that photo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You haven't seen it...? I see, Is that so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well.... Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, I was agonizing over it. Mimori is schoolmate with estimated to be at least an E-cup. I tried to pretend it happened accidentally like, 'Oops, I opened it by mistake. I wasn't interested in it anyway. Or, Sh*t, I accidentally saw it!'</p>

<p>&quot;But, you know, it's not good to do something like this after all. If you say this is a thank-you, even if it's well-intentioned, I can't accept it. I'll hand you my phone, so Mimori, please delete the photo directly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... But I don't think I can do that.&quot;</p>

<p>And with a nonchalant expression, Mimori said those words.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, you know, my chest isn't captured in that photo. ...At that moment, I turned off the flash on my phone. It was so dark that it was impossible to see anything inside my clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>........What?</p>

<p>Immediately, I pulled out my phone with incredible speed, opened the album, and became dumbfounded.</p>

<p>Just as Mimori said, the photo barely showed her school uniform, and the inside of her clothes was pitch black and completely invisible.</p>

<p>Mimori looked at me with a mischievous smile. It finally dawned on me as I saw that expression.</p>

<p>In other words... I fell into Mimori's trap.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Did you trick me, you!? Did you mess with me!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha. Riku-kun seems like a nice person, so I wondered if you would get all nervous. But even if you helped me, I wouldn't show you what's inside my clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, in a way, I'm relieved! But wasn't that photo supposed to be a thank-you gesture!? What kind of gratitude is a photo that doesn't show anything!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I bought these donuts for you, you know? Please, eat as much as you want. Riku-kun is my savior after all.&quot;</p>

<p>With a smile on her face, Mimori held out the donuts. So, yesterday's photo was fake gratitude, and this is the real deal...!</p>

<p>&quot;I've been fooled..... I must look like a idiot after all that internal struggle I went through. Give it back, return the time I wasted agonizing over that photo...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you really want to see my chest that badly? ...Well then, should I show you now?&quot;</p>

<p>With those words, my heart rate increased rapidly.</p>

<p>As I looked, Mimori had a small smile on her face, seemingly enjoying my reaction.</p>

<p>...Honestly. I felt embarrassed that even for a moment, my heart raced.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it. It's not something to joke about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm actually quite serious, you know. And I wouldn't just say this to anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, you're just teasing me, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, whatever ....But about that photo from earlier, can I say one thing? Even if it was an explicit photo, hypothetically speaking. Even if I, the person asked, it's okay for you to see it, why are you so troubled by it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Because, things like that are meant to be shown only to someone special. It's not fair for me to see it, or rather... I wanted you to value yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, you're worried about me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really. This is just my beliefs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...But I think it's because you're kind, Riku-kun. We're just two people who happened to meet by chance, and normally, people wouldn't think about such things. Especially when it comes to girls like me, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>'Girls like me.'</p>

<p>I didn't need to ask what she meant by that. I understood even without asking.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, you treat me like any ordinary girl you come across. Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Why? Well...&quot;</p>

<p>Casually, I answered honestly.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Mimori is an ordinary girl, aren't you? At least, that's how it appears to me.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at Mimori, who was taken aback, once again. Her natural face without makeup, simple attire without adornments, and her charming expression.</p>

<p>While other students talk about sugar daddies or delinquents...</p>

<p>I still can't believe that Mimori is that kind of girl.</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard the rumors, but I can't bring myself to see you as a bad person. That's why I have no reason to keep my distance... That answer is good enough, I guess?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...No, not at all. I'm really satisfied with it.&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason... Mimori's expression seems somewhat happy.</p>

<p>Mimori chose a Pon de Ring from the box of donuts and started eating it. Perhaps she was delighted by its chewy texture, as she ate it happily.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, do you have someone you like?&quot;</p>

<p>I almost choked on my food.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori. Are you trying to enjoy my reaction again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that. I'm just genuinely curious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't have anyone I like. Well, it's not surprising since there's no point in me having someone like that. It's impossible anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible? Are you giving up from the start?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah. It's kind of pathetic to say it myself, but I've never been liked by the opposite sex in my entire life. So, it's better not to have any expectations from the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p>That's why I believe that I shouldn't pay attention to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>When a guy start seeing someone as cute or beautiful, it leads to developing desires to like or love them.</p>

<p>That's why falling in-love is such foolish thing.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to be hurt by chasing after something that can't be fulfilled... I'm sorry, I've said too much. It's troublesome to be told such things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what if, hypothetically speaking?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's clear voice past through my ears.</p>

<p>&quot;What if... a girl said she liked you?&quot;</p>

<p>What kind of question is that? I couldn't help but almost laugh as I looked at Mimori... but then I held my breath.</p>

<p>Mimori finished eating the donut and lightly licked the sugar off her finger. Her face showed a certain tension, and her cheeks were faintly tinged with blush.</p>

<p>That expression on Mimori's face was something I had never seen before...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>And then, with a smile, Mimori slowly spoke the words.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go out together...? It seems like I've fallen for you.&quot;</p>

<p>I thought this must be a cruel joke or perhaps a dream.</p>

<p>I never expected to be confessed to by another girl.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey. This is just another one of your joke, right? Like the photo from earlier to make me flustered, and then you say it was all a lie in the end...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm serious. I wouldn't say these words with half-hearted feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's candy-like eyes captured my attention, and my heartbeat grew intense.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a selfish desire, but genuinely, it's only for you, Riku-kun, who cared for me and reached out to me. Even after we parted ways, your expression and voice stayed in my mind.... I want to be with you more.&quot;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00009.jpeg">

<p>&quot;Wait wait wait. We only met yesterday. And now you're suddenly confessing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how much time will pass, my feelings for you, will never change, Riku-kun. Besides, if I don't express my feelings to you soon, someone else might snatch you away, right?&quot;</p>

<p>No way, who would be so daring... Those words vanished within my heart.</p>

<p>But Mimori's expression was so sincere.</p>

<p>Is this really happening?</p>

<p>Being confessed to by Mimori, the biggest troublemaker in this high school. And not to mention, I, who never had any close female friends and a believer that I could never have a girlfriend.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you... give me some time to think?&quot;</p>

<p>With great effort, I squeezed out a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"I've never really considered having a girlfriend or anything like that until now. I always believed that even if I were to like someone, it would never be reciprocated my feelings."</p>

<p>&quot;So, does that mean you can't accept my confession?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that. It's just... honestly, I'm more bewildered with it than happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're so pure. That's why I fell for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the tension vanished from Mimori's expression.</p>

<p>&quot;I also want you to have time to think, so you don't have to answer right away. And it's not easy for me to say this, but being in a relationship with me carries quite a high risk. If it gets exposed, you might lose your place at this school. After all, your lover would be that Mimori Yui.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... Can I ask you one thing? You might not want to answer, but I want to hear it from your mouth, Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>I don't even have time to consider whether to date Mimori or not. But, in order to face Mimori's feelings head-on, there's problem in her that shouldn't be avoided.</p>

<p>It's a question that I have been avoiding to ask until now. That's precisely why I want to know the answer.</p>

<p>&quot;The rumor that you can sleeps with anyone if they ask you... Is that really true?&quot;</p>

<p>.................</p>

<p>The silence was painfully deafening. Mimori was looking at me... and eventually...</p>

<p>Mimori flashed an innocent smile.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's a secret.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time, the school bell rang in the distance. Five minutes until the end of lunch break.</p>

<p>&quot;It's time to go back. I'll be waiting for your answer to my confession. Oh, and don't forget the donuts, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey...!&quot;</p>

<p>Despite my attempts to stop her, my voice fell on deaf ears, and I was left alone in the clubroom.</p>

<p>&quot;A secret... Can such a thing even exist?&quot;</p>

<p>Or perhaps I was just being played by Mimori once again.</p>

<p>There were too many things happening all at once, and my mind couldn't keep up with it all. I even started to wonder if everything was just a lie. However, one phrase from Mimori kept echoing in my head.</p>

<p>'--I think I've fallen in love with you.'</p>

<p>&quot;...It's my first time someone really confessed to me.&quot;</p>

<p>The murmured words were left behind in the empty room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What should I do? What should I do, what should I do...!</p>

<p>I'm currently in class, but I'm sweating so heavily.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't dislike Mimori. I think she's cute, and she has a big chest, and above all, she's a girl who cares about others.</p>

<p>But... I don't think the feelings I have for Mimori are love.</p>

<p>Can someone like me be in a relationship with Mimori?</p>

<p>&quot;I'm such a troublesome person... I wonder what's good about someone like me.... in Mimori's perspective?&quot;</p>

<p>And there are still things that bother me.</p>

<p>For example, the fact that she evaded my question. '--It's a secret.'</p>

<p>...No, it's no use. Even if I think about it alone, I won't get any answer closer to the truth.</p>

<p>I want to know more about Mimori, even just a little. My emotions is getting ahead of me, and before I knew it, I had left the classroom and started searching Mimori, peeking into each classroom one by one.</p>

<p>But if Mimori catches me secretly watching her, she'll probably think I'm a weirdo.</p>

<p>Nervously, I continued to go around the classrooms, and eventually, I stopped at Class 2-6. Mimori was fidgeting with her phone by the window... But,</p>

<p>Mimori has really no friends.</p>

<p>Unlike me, I can't really fit to class or anything like that. But I hearing the rumors about Mimori, I didn't realize she was this blatantly avoided by others.</p>

<p>And there, Mimori was staring at her phone with an expression I had never seen before.</p>

<p>She always smiled happily when we talked.</p>

<p>...I can't understand it. Is Mimori really such that person, that she deserves to be treated like this? I don't know much about Mimori, but even so...</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing, Senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!!&quot;</p>

<p>Involuntarily, I bumped my foot against the door with a loud noise. Oh no...!</p>

<p>The students turned their attention towards the sound. Mimori was about to raise her face from her phone, but I immediately took the hand of a student who called out to me, signaling for an emergency retreat, and started running.</p>

<p>I moved to a corner of the corridor and let out a sigh of relief. I hope Mimori didn't notice that I was peeking.</p>

<p>&quot;What... What happened? Why did you suddenly start running...?&quot;</p>

<p>When I looked, it was Suzune who called out to me.</p>

<p>&quot;What's up, Suzune? It's rare to see you before school ends?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was in next room and I saw you, senpai looking for someone.&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if I look like a suspicious person?</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, a little... I was watching Mimori. I wanted to see what kind of student she is on a regular basis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori-san...? Ah, ahaha. You're joking, right? I mean, you watching Mimori-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you look like it's the end of the world? Just so you know, I was just quietly observing Mimori because I don't think she's as immoral person as the rumors say. I don't have any ulterior motives, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, I know! I trusted you, Senpai!&quot;</p>

<p>The tone of her voice earlier was quite serious, though.</p>

<p>&quot;But do you really have an interest in Mimori-san? You've never shown interest in girls before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, things have been a bit complicated... Suzune, do you happen to know anything about Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I already told you most of what I know yesterday... Oh! By the way, Mimori-san seems to love cherries, right? Despite the rumors, she's quite adorable. I like cherry tarts too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, my bad. Suzune, you've completely misunderstood. Don't ever say that in front of anyone other than me. Got it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? Yeah, if you say so, Senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune really is clueless when it comes to these things...</p>

<p>&quot;But to think Mimori is being talked about like that. I can't believe it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Are you really that concerned about Mimori-san?&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune's eyes gazed at me, wavering with unease.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know much about Mimori-san either. But you should be cautious about how she handles relationships. If the rumors are baseless, they will not likely spread so widely.&quot;</p>

<p>..................</p>

<p>Yes, Suzune was right. If it's all just baseless rumors, Mimori would deny them.</p>

<p>Since Mimori evaded the question, I don't know the truth. But if the rumors are true, and Mimori lacks a sense of fidelity and casually engages in relationships with guys...</p>

<p>&quot;Moreover, it would be better for you, especially Senpai, to stay away from someone like Mimori-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You mean someone like Mimori and to me, Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Mimori-san is truly that kind of person, a woman who plays on the feelings of the guys... I don't want you to get hurt by someone like her.&quot;</p>

<p>...Ah, I see.</p>

<p>Suzune is indeed my one and only kouhai. She understands me better than anyone else.</p>

<p>Why can't I just be happy about Mimori's confession? It's not because Mimori is a problematic person or anything like that... It's because I am Tokami Riku.</p>

<p>I should have realized that long ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks for worrying about me... I've already made up my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Senpai?&quot;</p>

<p>After school, I'll meet with Mimori.</p>

<p>Just as Mimori gathered her courage and confessed, I also need to convey my feelings directly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My heart is pounding so intense, and loud enough that I almost want it to stop beating. After all, I've never given a response to a confession before. It's pretty impossible to calm myself with just, 'Stay calm.'</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath in, I made a phone call, asking her to come to the club room after school.</p>

<p>When I opened the door, Mimori is already there, sitting on the bench, gazing at the sunset through the window.</p>

<p>&quot;You're late. It's been five minutes since I arrived.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You said to come a few minutes later, right? You didn't want anyone to see us entering the club room together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, but I was getting anxious while waiting for you. I wanted you to come quickly, but at the same time, I wanted you to never come. I thought this might be what it feels like to wait for a lover at a meeting spot... Even though you haven't given me any answers yet.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help to I almost laugh. Even in a moment like this, Mimori can crack jokes.</p>

<p>&quot;It was my first time confessing, you know? That's why my heart is pounding, so I won't say those words anymore... Tell me. Your answer.&quot;</p>

<p>Even without asking what those words referred to, I understood.</p>

<p>'--We should date... It seems like I've fallen for you.'</p>

<p>I clenched my fist so tightly that my nails dug into my palm.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but I can't respond to your feelings... I'm sure I can't develop feelings for you.&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, I felt as if time had stood still.</p>

<p>I wonder what's in her mind in this situation? Her serious expression remained unchanged.</p>

<p>&quot;It's my first time a girl confessed her feelings to me, so I genuinely appreciated it. But I think I probably don't have feelings for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori didn't say anything. She didn't ask any questions either.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want you to misunderstand, but it's not because you're you. I think I would give the same answer no matter which girl confessed to me... I just can't fall in love with anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>Love is an emotion that mistakenly sprouts to anyone.</p>

<p>That is the philosophy by which I, Tokami Riku believed on.</p>

<p>It's always the one who falls in love that gets hurt. Rejection, ridicule, and insults. In this world, there are certainly people who experience the agony of tearing themselves apart due to unrequited feelings.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm just afraid on falling in love with her.</p>

<p>The harder you love, the harder you get hurt. So, it's better not to fall in love in the first place.</p>

<p>Am I overthinking it? I chuckled.</p>

<p>But if that person haven't experienced that kind of rejection, then that person must be privileged&mdash; Why? Because he/she haven't experience that unpleasant feelings before.</p>

<p>At least I'm different. I've desperately made efforts to prevent myself from liking anyone by putting up defenses and not considering the opposite sex as romantic interests. Eye contact is not avoidable, but it is battle itself.</p>

<p>I don't want to feel love because, I know that my heart would crumble.</p>

<p>In fact, Mimori must be feeling miserable right now. She confessed to me, and now she's being rejected like this. The pain in her heart must be very deep... And yet.</p>

<p>Even so, Mimori was smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;...I kinda had that feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's voice was weaker than usual.</p>

<p>&quot;You always seemed like you were keeping your distance from girls, Riku-kun. I've been thinking if you had any bad experiences. But I will never betray you, I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>With a smile on their lips, Mimori lowered her gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;It's hard to believe even if I say that, right?... But maybe this is for the best. Even if you date a girl like me, You would probably end up getting troubled. People might say your only dating me for physical attraction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a moment... There's something I want to confirm about those rumors.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps realizing the seriousness in my voice, Mimori's smile disappeared from her face.</p>

<p>&quot;When I asked you about the rumors regarding you, you said it was a secret. That's correct, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'll leave it up to your imagination when it comes to rumors about me.&quot;</p>

<p>So, it seems that's an unwavering stance.</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, you wouldn't mind if I think you can sleep with anyone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind... But are you disappointed with me now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be honest, I am. If you're that kind of girl who casually gets involved with guys... It's really sad for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, I think it's normal to feel that way.&quot;</p>

<p>Ideally, I wanted Mimori to deny it. I wanted her to laugh and tease me, saying that the rumors around her were complete lies, and that she never believed such rumors.</p>

<p>But if that wish doesn't come true...</p>

<p>There's only one thing left for me to do.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey, Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a decision I kept in my heart&mdash;perhaps it would be the first and last confession in my high school life.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're okay with it... Would you be my girlfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>This time, I truly felt as if time stopped.</p>

<p>Because, you see, Mimori was looking at me, her expression frozen in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;...Why?&quot; Eventually, Mimori asked. &quot;You said you can't fall for me... right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't respond to your feelings. I can't imagine myself falling in love with someone right now. But even so, I want you to be my girlfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>Without hesitation, without wavering, I clearly voiced my words.</p>

<p>&quot;If that happens, You won't get involved with any other guy, right?... Because if you have a boyfriend named Tokami Riku, it would be considered cheating.&quot;</p>

<p>Caught off guard, Mimori was left speechless.</p>

<p>I probably can't fall in love, and I have no intention of changing that... But, I want Mimori to value herself more.</p>

<p>I couldn't fall in love with Mimori, but I wanted to be in relationship with her&mdash;that was the answer I gave to her.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to believe that you're that kind of girl. Every time I hear rumors about you, my heart becomes restless. I don't know if the rumors are true, but if they are, I want this to stop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really okay with it? Because if you believe the rumors, it means I'm a terrible girl. Are you willing to date someone like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine with it. The Mimori Yui I know is a kind girl who cares about others. I want to trust my own intuition rather than the ambiguous words spoken by others.&quot;</p>

<p>I can't imagine myself falling in love with her, but if I can be in a relationship with her and I will transform her like the normal girls anywhere...</p>

<p>Because of that, I can say this from the bottom of my heart. I truly want her to be my girlfriend.</p>

<p>&quot;Even someone like me who isn't prepared to fall in love, might be a nuisance. But still, I want to be with you... What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori was taken aback... and eventually, she gently leaned closer to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just like you, Riku-kun. Going out with me for my sake...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's not for your sake. It's for my sake. I don't want you to be that kind of girl.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said those words, I turned my head in embarrassment. It was a distance where I could easily embrace her. Being this close to a girl might be another first experience to me.</p>

<p>&quot;But well, fine, it's a bit disappointing to hear that you don't have feelings for me. But if it means that you're already taken and can do lewd things with me, then it's fine, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori had a smile on her face, and right after that, I understood.</p>

<p>She close herself for reason.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori, are you trying to deliberately embarrass me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahaha. I'd be happy if you atleast get flustered because of me. Besides, from now on, we'll do more things that couples do, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That might be the case, but don't expect too much from me. I'll say it again, but I won't fall in love with you... Sorry, but I think it's time for me to go. Being with you right now makes me feel extremely anxious. Let's talk properly next time, at a more relaxed place.&quot;</p>

<p>In reality, I'm still nervous and can't even look at Mimori's face properly. If I stay with her any longer, I might lose my mind from the embarrassment.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmn, that's fine... Bye. I'm really happy that you dated me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yep, likewise. If you're okay with someone like me who can't properly say I love you, then please take care of me.&quot;</p>

<p>I removed the doorstopper, placed my hand on the doorknob, and slowly opened the door...</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right. Riku-kun, can I ask you something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;....?&quot;</p>

<p>With questions in my mind, I turned around&mdash;and felt a soft, marshmallow-like sensation on my lips.</p>

<p>I couldn't immediately understand what it was.</p>

<p>A sweet scent tickled my nose. The club room filled sunsets light. Mimori, standing on tiptoes, closing her eyes, and the softness I felt on my lips made my head spin.</p>

<p>Another first experience, but this time&mdash; it's my first kiss.</p>

<p>The moment I realized that, I stumbled outside the club room, falling flat on my back.</p>

<p>&quot;W-wh-wh&mdash;a!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, right? We're a couple, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>From inside the club room, Mimori look at me with a somewhat challenging smile. I couldn't take my eyes off those beautiful cherry-colored lips.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm happy that you're my boyfriend, Riku-kun, but I still want you to love me. I want to be special person for you. That's why I made a decision&mdash; from now on, I'll definitely make you fall in love with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;M-Mimori...?&quot;</p>

<p>It felt like a declaration of war.</p>

<p>Mimori spoke calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, isn't love something you fall into rather than something you choose? ...Be prepared, Riku-kun. It was you after all, who fills my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>With a smile still on her face, Mimori closed the door.</p>

<p>Left alone, I couldn't keep my thoughts. Everything seemed like a dream, and I couldn't take a single step forward from that spot.</p>

<p>But I had a premonition.</p>

<p>A premonition that the days from now would turn my entire life upside down.</p>

<p>Feeling the lingering sweet numbness on my lips, I quietly murmured in my heart.</p>

<p><i>'Perhaps, I ended up dating an extraordinary girl.'</i></p>
