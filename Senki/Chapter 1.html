<h1 class="calibre1">1: Never to Part</h1>

<p class="calibre5">Early April.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was right after I had moved up to my second year of high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Spring in the countryside is mild. Seriously, events in the countryside strictly follow the calendar. It’s a laid-back time of the year.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One afternoon after school, a group of girls were chatting excitedly in a corner of the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, isn’t Himari’s post this morning just insane?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I thought so too. She’s too cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two were peering into their smartphones.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The ‘this morning’ they referred to was about a post that Himari had made on Instagram.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a photo taken at a café along Route 10 during the spring break.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was holding a new sunflower summer gelato, seated on a refreshing wood deck.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Adorning her ears were earrings featuring preserved flowers designed like lilies of the valley.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Peeping out from her large sunglasses were eyes of captivating marine blue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Beyond the window stretched the azure sea of Hyuga Bay.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The temperature had spiked suddenly this week, making everyone sharply aware of the coming summer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her Instagram post seemed to capture that vividly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari had started posting on Instagram since entering high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She already had good material to start with, and in less than a year, she had accumulated over 50,000 followers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was astonishing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was locally famous, and whenever a new post was uploaded, you could see scenes of lively chatter like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if you go to the food court at Aeon after school, you’d encounter female students from other schools having similar conversations.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, the countryside really is a place where not much happens.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the seat next to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">That Himari was calmly stuffing textbooks into her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She remains a strangely charismatic woman. Even the drab uniform of this rural school looks like a brand-new designer piece when she wears it. It’s puzzling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In these two years, she has grown a bit taller. Well, not just taller; her body has stretched out in an impressively proportionate manner, often playfully attracting the gazes of the boys.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her expression has taken on a curious sensuality.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her well-shaped lips shine with a light gloss, and whenever Himari licks her lips, it sends ripples through the room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her flowing, beautiful hair… she’s cut it quite daringly. But the naturally messy short bob suits the mischievous Himari well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her clear marine blue eyes remain the same, almond-shaped and striking… it was as enchanting as ever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The clear-skinned beauty from two years ago has become more mature, but at the same time, her innocent nature has become even more apparent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It very much reveals the inherently mischievous Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The two girls from earlier approached Himari’s desk.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Where is this store?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you head toward the city on Route 10, you should find it easily. They said this gelato is a limited menu item until autumn, I think?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And these earrings? Can I buy them at Aeon?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They’re custom-made, so I don’t think they’re sold at the stores.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see! I want some too!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari handed them a business card.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It only had 『you』 written on it, belonging to a flower accessory creator.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You can buy them online. Order from the site linked by the QR code on this business card. If you enter this key code, delivery is free. You can use it multiple times, so feel free to order even just one item.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really?! Thank you so much!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, she was invited to hang out after school. The plan was to go to karaoke.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, in this town, the usual places to hang out after school are either Aeon, karaoke, or Sushiro.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed quite a few people would be participating. Some of them might be meeting Himari for the first time since the class reshuffle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They probably want to get Himari into their group.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…The influence of a local prestigious family’s young lady is still strong in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it’s probably even greater than it was two years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The regional development project that Himari’s second eldest brother who works at the city office was spearheading finally opened a new expressway.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This made traveling to the neighboring prefecture easier, and the stock of the Inuzuka family skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To that 120% flattery and 120% ulterior-motived invitation, Himari responded with a smiling ‘Hmm, what should I do,’ all the while grinning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt her gaze shift in my direction for a moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I slung my bag over my shoulder and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without exchanging greetings with anyone, I left the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The corridor was bustling with students heading home. Some were in their tracksuits, heading to club activities.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I arrived at the science room in a separate building. Using the key I borrowed from the staff room, I opened the door.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There were six tables, each seating six people. I placed my bag on the table by the window at the front.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the back of the science room, large steel shelves are lined up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I unlocked the sliding door at the bottom of the right steel shelf. Inside, LED planters are arranged.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re great for growing plants indoors without worrying about pests.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The winter-blooming flowers have already been harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, spring seeds and seedlings are planted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amaryllis, lavender, pinks, marigold…I took photos of them all, documenting their growth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After changing the water, my duties for the gardening club were finished.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, it’s time for my personal activities.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I closed and locked the LED planter’s sliding door. Then, I unlocked the sliding door one shelf up and pulled out two cardboard boxes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I opened one lid, it was packed with airtight cases I had bought from a hundred-yen store. I took one out to check its contents.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Inside was a large amount of desiccant and flower parts of preserved flowers that had been taken out of a solution.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They were processed petals from pansies.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I checked the color of the petals. The bright yellow had deepened slightly. It had a nice aged look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was no sign of degradation on the petals, and the only thing left to assess was the degree of drying.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I opened the other cardboard box.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This one contained my assembled work tools.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took tweezers from the toolbox and put on vinyl gloves. I then opened the lid of the airtight case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Using the tweezers, I extracted the pansy petals.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Looks good, I guess?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes. It looks good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Actually, it looks pretty great. I thought the petals might be too thin and could come off, but…</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, I should handle it with care… It would be a waste if the petals came off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Okay, the real work starts now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I prepared a desktop magnifying glass.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With its assistance, I began processing the flower accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First, I had to thread the petal onto a ring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This part requires the most attention because I can’t damage the petals, and it could affect the overall appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I carefully finished the work and swiftly secured it with adhesive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Angle, appearance, strength… all good.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Next is the foundation for the earring. I shaped it into the form of an earring using wire and metal sticks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since the pansy is yellow, I use a cool, bluish metal to complement it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Lastly, I combine the foundational piece with the ring threaded with the pansy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This time, I arranged the orientation of the pansy to face forward when worn by the customer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The idea is to give the impression that a pansy flower is blooming from the earlobe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I use a powered soldering iron to weld the foundational piece to the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One mistake here, and all my previous efforts would be ruined.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For example, if the tip of the soldering iron touches the flower even slightly, it will immediately burn.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The science room is eerily silent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From afar, I can hear the sounds of the brass band practicing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This tranquility feels good. I wonder if this is how swordsmen in the Edo period felt during their duels.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Here goes nothing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bring the tip of the soldering iron close to the connection and the solder.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I touch it faintly, then quickly pull away. …It seems a bit weak. I couldn’t get it in one go.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the second attempt… the soldering bead is a bit bigger, but it’s okay. It doesn’t compromise the appearance of the flower.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, to prevent corrosion on the soldered part and to add some color, I apply a patina solution. This should camouflage any slight color changes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One side is complete. I check it under the light of a desk stand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wipe the sweat from my brow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment an accessory is complete is always exhilarating. It feels like I’m in my own world, completely isolated from the outside.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve always loved these moments of solitude.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My sister and others say I’m gloomy, but it’s just my natural disposition.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m a creator, and I believe in embracing solitude to truly face oneself…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh! It turned out cute again this time!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Without warning, my tranquility was shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Slender arms reached over my shoulders from behind. Then they bent and wrapped around my neck in a hug.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was Himari. She wrapped her arms around my neck, peering over my shoulder at the accessory in my hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehe. Were you surprised?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she tilted her head slightly, her silky hair ends tickled my cheek. Luminous marine blue eyes stared straight back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The twinflower choker she’s been wearing since junior high school faintly glistened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, don’t suddenly hug me when I’m handling the soldering iron. And since when have you been here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“About an hour ago. You were completely ignoring me even when I spoke to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s hand turned off the soldering iron. She whispered softly in my ear, ‘Yuu, you idiot.’ as if to say ”It’s time to play with me now,’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I still have one more to do…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve had my fill of your sparkling eyes for today, so it’s closing time. Do your best to appease your partner.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Alright, alright. Just stop whispering in my ear…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari then took a sip from a paper-packed yogurt drink.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She then pulled another one from her skirt pocket and put its straw into my mouth. I gratefully took a sip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hm, this is nice. I was quite thirsty from concentrating on my work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Although I’d prefer something like Pocari Sweat instead of a probiotic drink.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, weren’t you invited to karaoke earlier?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh? I turned it down.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What a waste, they took the trouble to invite you. Some of them are in the same class as you for the first time so you should have gone out with them.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, that wouldn’t have been so bad, but you’d be shooting me jealous looks.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I won’t! Don’t make things up.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari gave a broad smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s kind of like, ‘I’m letting you monopolize this cute little me, so be a little more grateful or I’ll kill you?’ sentiment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, she really is cute, but this feels more like a scam.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Despite saying that, you were giving me such a heated gaze right now, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I was just remembering the junior high school cultural festival. Your hair was long back then.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“In that case, haven’t you grown taller, Yuu? Wasn’t I taller back then?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I tried standing up as a test, Himari hung from my neck, letting out a ‘kyaa!’ sound and flapping her legs around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…right, maybe it’s not so much that Himari hasn’t grown much, but that I’ve grown too tall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking at the clock, it was already past 5 p.m.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, can you let go?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I can’t do that. This back is my special seat.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This again…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, I’m pretty used to it now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Work really doesn’t progress well on weekdays. It would be easier if I could work at home.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is your room off-limits again?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My cat played with the flowers I was working on. The thing is, no matter where I hide them, she always finds them.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. Why don’t you do it at my place? We have a spare room, so you can use it as a workshop.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way. Your Nii-san always brings expensive sushi.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Being welcomed by the whole family is kind of tough for a teenage boy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I thought that influential people from the countryside would be more intimidating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Recently, I don’t even have enough flowers.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You could just buy flowers from a store.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I want to use something I’m proud of.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm. I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why does she look so pleased?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve known Himari for a long time now, but I still don’t fully understand what makes her happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I never thought we’d still be best friends, even after two years.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari has a lot of friends, so I thought she’d get bored of me quickly.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, it’s all thanks to your Instagram.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The 『you』 that Himari introduces is, well, basically me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t use Instagram for fun; she does it to promote my accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just like this morning’s gelato post, in all her Instagram posts, Himari wears my flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Through Himari’s account, there’s also a link to the sales site, and those interested can order.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a strategy that balances fundraising for the store and promoting the flower accessories.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We tried various things during junior high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I frequently visited nearby bazaars and uploaded the creation process on YouTube… As a result, this method works the best.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably the combination of ‘beautiful girl × flower accessory’ is the most appealing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, Himari, what happened with that entertainment agency that contacted you the other day?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I turned them down since I’m staying in my hometown until I finish high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously? What a waste.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha. If I took on that much, I wouldn’t have time to promote your accessories.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They said they’d come all the way out to this countryside to see you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm. It’d be bad if the world realized how cute I am. I mean, what if an oil baron who fell in love with me at first sight proposed? Then there’d be a major fight between the wives, and it would be tragic.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Where do you get that oversized confidence from? Nobody’s worried about that, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While her eyes followed my hand movements with amusement, Himari’s juice box made a sipping sound.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She then said, ‘When you’re done drinking, can I have yours?’ and casually folded up both juice boxes and put them in her pocket.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Look, you and I are bound by fate. If Yuu can’t get married, I’ll have to take responsibility. I feel sorry for your parents, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Can you not say that? I’m having trouble now because after Himari said that, your Nii-san started calling me ‘Brother-in-law.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s fine! Just become his brother-in-law.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way. I have my hands full with you alone, I can’t handle your equally noisy Onii-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. Our mansion is really spacious. There’s enough room to ensure privacy for three families.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why are you assuming I’d live with your Onii-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s scary because that seems like a real possibility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Being surrounded by people with the same DNA as Himari from morning to night is just a game of punishment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you don’t like it, why don’t you get married first? You’ve been in high school for a year; haven’t you found someone you like?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, the thing is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah? You still can’t forget your first love?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up. It’s not that I can’t forget her. It’s just that I haven’t had a more impactful encounter since.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Impactful encounter&mdash;&mdash;Wasn’t that the girl you helped when she got lost in the botanical garden?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. At that time, the hibiscus we saw together was beautiful. She was a quiet and cute girl in a white dress. She was lost too, and it was cute how she was constantly holding onto my sleeve from behind.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari intently stared at my profile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, with a somewhat serious expression, she poked my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’ve been wanting to say this for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari snorted with laughter through her nose.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Isn’t that girl just a creepy fantasy of yours, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Or maybe you love flowers so much that you had a hallucination…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“How’s that different from a ‘creepy fantasy’? Can you explain?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your dreamy nature is one of your charms, Yuu. But maybe it’s time to focus on real girls?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why? What’s wrong with it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because, even if you meet that first love again, it wouldn’t look cool if you’re still a virgin, would it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her words pierced me deeply. Then I accidentally dropped the equipment I was cleaning up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s fine! I don’t even want to meet her again!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. Not even trying to cover up your virginity. I like that about you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“First of all! Everyone probably thinks I have a girlfriend because you’re always all over me at school!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I retorted with all my might.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But Himari, covering her mouth, grinned and playfully patted my chest.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ehh? But I’ve had boyfriends quite a few times, okay? Maybe you’re just lacking in pheromones, Yuu. Don’t blame me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Those guys you dumped spreading weird rumors about me, you know? Why are there false stories going around that I stole you away from your boyfriend?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe that’s because I always talk about Yuu in front of my boyfriend?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Stop it, it’s really annoying! Now I don’t even know where the landmines are in school!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s not like I’m dating my boyfriend because I like him or anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then why are you dating them?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Just to kill time?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh. I seriously can’t stand that side of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. I still don’t really get this whole romantic feelings thing though.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Two years have passed since that junior high school cultural festival.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When it came to matters of love, the two of us were as clueless as ever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, I guess things are fine as they are now. When I turn 30, it’ll be a problem if no one wants me though…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You really plan on not getting married until you open our own specialty store?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I never really intended to get married in the first place. But if Yuu gets married before me, I feel like they might seriously try to set me up for an arranged marriage. I’d really hate that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t use people as your shield. Whether it’s an arranged marriage or whatever, just get married already.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Maybe the match they have in mind is a total old man, you know? Yuu, would you be okay with me marrying a man around the same age as my dad?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh, seriously?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. My young body would be sullied by the greasy hands of an old man…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow… Sometimes you throw in these er*tic phrases that even make a guy like me cringe…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry for being a cute naughty girl, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not the cute image I was thinking of…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She is more like junior high school boys who pick up p*rnographic books in a deserted park.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre5">For example, ‘〇〇 Senpai and his girlfriend had s*x at ××’, she has an uncanny knack for picking up on such rumors and discussing them with her friends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite being such a beautiful girl, she’s seriously not thrilling at all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do people really still do arranged marriages these days?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They do. If things go wrong, I’ll get hit by that right after high school graduation. I bet my picture’s already circulating among acquaintances. That’s why I haven’t decided on any career path, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, right. I remember in our first year, you got scolded for submitting a blank career form.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They said to write down anything, so I wrote ‘Yuu’s bride,’ but that got me scolded even more…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course they’d get mad at that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Don’t just use someone’s name without permission.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No wonder since then, the teacher keeps weirdly checking if I ‘always have my phone on me.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sorry, but I have no plans to use it even if I do.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…But do arranged marriages between rich families really happen in this Reiwa era?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I seriously think it’s outdated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wouldn’t want to make life decisions like that. Especially with someone two decades older…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, at the very least, I’ll be your cover for that time…We’re best friends, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After saying something that cool, I turned back with a confident face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s when I saw Himari cheeks puffed up like a squirrel’s and shaking, trying hard to hold back her laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I got the hint… She’s teasing me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pffft! You’re so gullible♪”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You! I’ll knock you down!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There’s no way arranged marriages like that happen nowadays. Have you been reading too much er*tic novels?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re the one who started talking about greasy hands!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After laughing for a bit, Himari playfully tousled my hair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry, I won’t abandon you halfway. I plan to enjoy this special seat for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her arms tightened around my neck.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I protested by tapping on her arms.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“My neck! This special seat is choking me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The man with the most comfortable neck to hug in Japan~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What kind of title is that? It doesn’t make me happy at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The woman with the most comforting arms to be hugged by in Japan~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know. To claim that title, you might be a bit too thin…hey, don’t put so much strength into your arms!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As we continued their usual playful banter, the 6 p.m. be;; rang.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sports clubs can operate until 8 p.m., but cultural clubs essentially have to wrap up by this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This building will soon be locked and everyone must leave by then.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Should we call it a day?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sounds good~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not just ‘sounds good’. You help out too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And while you’re at it, let go of my neck. Stand on your own feet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Don’t hang on me and laugh so cheerfully. If you drag me like this, it really feels like I’m being strangled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright then, Himari-san. Let’s do the departure check. Tools okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Flowers okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Keys okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Feeling like McDonald’s on the way home okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm, I might be in the mood for sushi.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, really? I’ll send a message to Onii-chan then. ‘Today Yuu wants to eat sushi, so please buy that expensive one’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just Sushiro on the way home is fine! Okay? Okay!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Sigh. My brother-in-law is so unappreciative.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Who’s your brother-in-law?</p>
<p class="calibre5">We locked the science room and headed home.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is the daily life of Yuu and Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In a sense, it’s the little world they built together over these two years. And everything had been going almost perfectly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the gears of their daily life were slightly thrown off the next day.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">A whole day had passed, and it was after school the following day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari was away for a committee meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such things were common. It’s easy to forget when she’s with me, but Himari is known as an honor student.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She actively participated in committee and volunteer activities.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Well, probably to save face for her well-off family. Being born into a wealthy household has its challenges.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Before heading to the science room, I stopped by the vending machine corner to buy a Yōguruppe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Always being made to drink it by Himari, I had become quite fond of the lactobacilli.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I inserted coins into the machine and pressed the button. A carton dropped into the retrieval slot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s nice to have some quiet moments every now and then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Being with Himari is fun, but my dad used to say that a true man enjoys the silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I know he used that as an excuse because he couldn’t out-argue my mom, but I kind of liked that dandy saying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A female student was approaching from the front.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her hair was straight and black, tinged with a hint of red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had elongated eyes, giving off a somewhat sharp impression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her uniform was loosely worn, with a considerably open neckline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Judging by the color stripe on her tie, she was in the same grade.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t know her name, and I don’t think we were in the same class last year.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…She struck me as incredibly beautiful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Among beautiful girls, Himari had a comforting aura. If I were to describe her, she felt like a fairy dwelling in a tranquil forest, like a character in a game who would restore a traveler’s health.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But this black-haired girl felt sharp, like a keen knife. Modern, I guess.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She seemed like she’d casually gossip about her boyfriend behind his back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had an aura similar to my elder sisters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Crap. She noticed me staring. I quickly averted my eyes…I’m just an ordinary guy, after all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, I have a soft spot for beautiful girls even though they intimidate me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It sounds incredibly contradictory, but what I mean is that they serve as ‘inspiration for my accessory designs.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, actually talking to them is honestly scary and out of the question. Beautiful girls are best when they’re silent.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, I was imagining an accessory that would suit that black-haired girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From the brief glance, she seemed like the ‘fashion-conscious’ type.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had her makeup perfectly done and didn’t forget to wear accessories to enhance her appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hairpins, necklaces… just the right amount for everything above the neck. It’s not about wearing as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, the space left for my accessory would be from her neck down.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had light nail polish on, and the rings might clash too much. So, the wrist might be the target…</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Yes, something like a loose bracelet… uh?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">What caught my eye was her left hand resting on her shoulder bag. On that wrist, there was one of my flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Queen of the Night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a flower with large, lustrous white petals, like the epitome of beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Its symbolic meanings are as captivating as its appearance: ‘Glamorous Beauty’, ‘Fleeting Love’ and ‘Just once, I Wish to See You’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I remember.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Queen of the Night has petals almost as large as a palm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After processing it into a preserved flower, I divided the petals and stamen to make an accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was sealed in resin in a heart shape, similar to Himari’s choker, and then attached to a metal bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was one of the pieces I sold two years ago at the junior high school cultural festival.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was the best work I had done at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The incredibly emotional flower meanings were also a reason it stood out in my memory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…So there are people other than Himari who still wear my work from back then.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unlike exposed preserved flowers, those sealed in resin can last for years with proper care. But in the end, it’s just an accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For many women, accessories are fleeting. In other words, they easily get tired of them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Except for special items like wedding rings, I think only eccentrics like Himari would wear the same thing all the time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not a sad thing. That’s just how it’s fated to be.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m confident in my creations, but I don’t intend to impose them on the buyer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It would be arrogant of me to expect them to cherish the feelings I put into my work forever.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I was just a bit surprised.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(I don’t remember such a beautiful girl among the guests though…..?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not surprising I don’t remember. It was so hectic during the sales at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I’ll report this unexpected reunion with the Queen of the Night to Himari once I get home.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can already see her teasing, ‘Did you fall for her? You must have, right?’</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took my Yōguruppe from the vending machine and passed by the girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The black-haired girl took out her wallet in front of the vending machine. She probably plans to drink it during club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I walked, I inserted a straw into the carton. I then remembered, ‘Oh, this was supposed to be for later.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Should I buy another one? But if I go back now, it would look suspicious…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if that black-haired girl has already left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With such hope, I glanced back at the vending machine. …She was still there, just about to insert her coins.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was then that I noticed something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Moonflower bracelet on her left hand had vanished. Did she put it in her bag in the meantime?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thinking so, I lowered my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And the black-haired girl also looked down, probably to pick up her purchased drink.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“──Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Whose voice was that?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It might have been her voice since it sounded unexpectedly sweet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or perhaps we both exclaimed at the same time. Either way, our gazes were fixed on the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At her feet…</p>

<p class="calibre5">The Moonflower accessory had fallen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The joint of the bracelet was broken. It was something bought with a junior high school club budget.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s natural for it to degrade over time. In fact, I’m surprised it lasted as long as it did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My feelings had cooled down by this point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t so much that I didn’t care about my work anymore… but yes, cooled down was the right term.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve created hundreds of accessories up until now. I put passion into every single one of them, but I rarely look back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, accessories are consumables.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They represent fleeting encounters, and that is their value.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Misunderstanding their essence would be bad for business.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What Himari and I aim for is something unique, yet not so. We are craftsmen, not artists.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But perhaps it was different for her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The black-haired girl hurriedly picked up the accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She carefully wiped its resin surface with a handkerchief, checking for any damage.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just from that action, I could tell she treasured the accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She touched the deteriorated, torn part, then hastily withdrew her finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seemed a sharp edge had accidentally pricked her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She quickly sucked on her fingertip… but her gaze remained fixed on the broken accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes were slightly moist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looked like the type who would just throw away a broken accessory in any nearby trash can.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, she looked so lost, as if it was the end of the world, and that pierced my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I couldn’t help but speak up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can fix that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The black-haired girl looked up at me, puzzled.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_06.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">Even though I’m usually bad with beautiful girls…I was staring intently at her beautiful face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, if it’s someone I’m meeting for the first time, I usually can’t even meet their gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then she, as if to extinguish the excitement in my heart in an instant, coldly retorted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s with you all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wow, that’s harsh…!</p>
<p class="calibre5">That one sentence from her carried an overwhelming pressure that seemed to destroy the entire atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I mean, of course. If some stranger suddenly says, ‘Should I fix that treasured accessory for you?’ they’d just be seen as suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If this happened outside the school, I might even end up in the custody of the police.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And besides, if she really wanted to, she could just go to any accessory shop to have it fixed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Though, since it’s a personal original, she might be a bit reluctant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, sorry. It just… looked like you treasured it a lot…Please forget it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And I fled. There was a trail from the yogurt drink spewing out from the straw, but I didn’t have thetime to look back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So damn embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I tell Himari about this, she’d probably burst out laughing with a ‘Pffthaha!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I absolutely won’t tell her. I’ll take this secret to my grave!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">Two days later during class.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was classical literature class, but I wasn’t focused at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Actually, it’s been like this for a while now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…If I let my guard down, I’d flashback to that cold stare from the black-haired girl that day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That look, as if she’s seeing some trashy bug. I mean, I know I was suspicious, but was there really a need to hate me that much?</p>
<p class="calibre5">──Thump.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From the seat next to me, a rolled-up memo flew over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I unfolded it, it read in cute round letters,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Hey, creep. You should pay attention to the class properly~.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I looked to the side, Himari was grinning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ignoring her led to another memo ball being tossed over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This one read,</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Should I find that girl for you? It might be fate~ (lol).』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I folded it up and put it in my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Lastly, a punch from Himari came flying, hitting my right shoulder with a weak jab.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t ignore me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Come on, this clearly deserves to be ignored. You really think I’d fall for such elementary school-level teasing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? How can you say that about my kind gesture?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kind gesture? So, what do you plan to do if you find her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, maybe I’ll record a video of Yuu getting rejected.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a hard pass. Why are you assuming I’m going to confess in the first place?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry. Even if you get arrested as a creep, I’ll take you back. Oh, but if I get married in the meantime, forgive me, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s beyond irresponsible…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh come on. So, do you want to commit to me for real? Should I issue a reservation ticket? Will a thumbprint suffice?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve told you a million times, that’s the last thing I want…uh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, I realized that the gazes of the surrounding students were focused on us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the podium, the elderly classical literature Sensei was staring intently at us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun. You shouldn’t disturb Inuzuka-san’s studies too much, okay~?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why the hell it was me!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess Himari always looks good in public, so somehow, it always seems like I’m the one pestering her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Damn that Himari magic.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Your response?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">Classical literature class ended, and it was lunch break.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was preparing my convenience store bread, Himari came up from behind and rested her chin on my head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she rhythmically tapped on my shoulders.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Because of you, Yuu, I got scolded~”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You have some nerve to say that. How thick-skinned can you be…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I shook my head up and down, bumping into Himari’s chin repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari made seal-like noises, going “Ow, ow, ow!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I could hear our female classmates whispering, ‘Those two are always so lovey-dovey all day,’ ‘They’ve been like that since last year,’ and ‘Seriously, just explode.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry my best friend doesn’t understand TPO(time, place, occasion)…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, Yuu, are you still hung up on what happened the day before yesterday?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not hung up on it. I’m perfectly calm.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But you haven’t made any progress since the day before yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t worry about it. Being treated like a creep by a pretty girl is more like a reward, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“There’s no way that’s true. Who even said that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My older brother. When I told him you were treated like a creep by a pretty girl, he said, ‘I’ll pay him to switch places with me.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why is he so handsome and has such a good personality but his fetishes are just so messed up?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, maybe it’s genetic?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Genetic…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“All of our family has some sort of fetish. My grandpa went to Europe because he had a fetish for blue eyes, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, you’ve inherited that, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly. I also have an eye fetish. For now, your passionate eyes are definitely my favorite♡”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, thanks, I guess…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, I couldn’t keep the incident with the black-haired girl a secret.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a result, I’ve been toyed with by Himari for the past two days however she pleases.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But it’s a good thing, right? There’s someone who still cherishes Yuu’s first handmade flower accessory.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, she’s seriously a weirdo.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey! I cherish my choker a lot too, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Honestly, I think you’re the weirdest…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Up until now, I’ve made several new accessories for Himari. But she would never let go of this twinflower choker.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, of course, I’m grateful. …But somehow, being conscious of that makes me feel uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was talking with Himari, a classmate called out to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun, you have a visitor.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A visitor for me? That’s rare.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be frank, I don’t have as many acquaintances as Himari. I’m really not that sociable after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was about to head to the hallway, the guy showed his face in the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Natsu! I came to visit!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ah, Makishima, is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A flashy-looking guy with brown hair was waving at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shinji Makishima. We were in the same class last year.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Right after entering school, our seats were next to each other, and we started talking frequently.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We’re in different classes this year, but whenever we see each other in the halls or during combined classes, we greet each other.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, he’s my only male friend. …That sounded a bit roundabout, but he’s basically my only friend other than Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s the matter, you womanizer?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha! What a greeting right off the bat! I love that about you♪”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima is a natural born playboy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s a modern-day samurai who makes advances on multiple female students at once, and each time, ends up in chaotic situations.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The moment he appeared in the classroom, several girls in our class clicked their tongues with fierce expressions, hinting at his reputation…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t this guy’s mentality too strong?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just so you know, I didn’t bring an English dictionary today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t come to borrow that. I have something I want to ask you, Natsu.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">By the way, ‘Natsu’ refers to me. It’s from Yuu Natsume.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What does he want to ask me…? As I was thinking that, Himari spoke up from behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Makishima-kun. What brings you here?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hello, Himari-chan. How are you today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe. Thanks to him, I’m enjoying another fun day of high school life.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Good to hear. I’m just borrowing my Natsu here for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, she clung to my arm with both of hers, responding with a prickly smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Right. Thank you, Makishima-kun, for always playing with my Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Grr!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sparks flew between them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hey, hold on. Why are you two having a staring contest over me like I’m some object?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m my own person! And it’s my parents who pay for my tuition!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… Didn’t you two date in junior high school? Why are you so hostile to each other?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For the record, it seems Makishima was Himari’s boyfriend before she met me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was quite surprised when I first heard about it…Really, relationships in small towns are so intertwined.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re both the type to move on quickly, so maybe it feels a bit weird to bring it up now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari smirked as if she had an epiphany.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Even if he was just a pastime, I really don’t want to remember my time with this guy.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you despise me that much? Did I do something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, thanks to you juggling five relationships at once, I got a lot of resentment and harassment from the other girls, remember?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha. That’s what happens when you accept confessions out of mere curiosity, without any real feelings. It’s your punishment for underestimating me and comparing me to any average guy. Consider it a life lesson.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Typical of the world’s sleaziest guy, always doubling down on his actions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Now that I think about it, was Makishima the reason Himari is so wary of relationships?</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the first I’ve heard of it, but he really is an irredeemable playboy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Makishima, didn’t you have something you wanted to ask me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, right. I almost forgot.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then Makishima got to the point.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Two days ago, after school, did you talk to a girl near the vending machines?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A girl? Two days ago… are you talking about that black-haired girl?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I guessed that, I felt the blood drain from my face.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Could it be Makishima’s current girlfriend? Well, I did talk to her, but I didn’t have any intention to hit on her…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No-no. It’s not about that.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He poked my chest with his index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I mean, that’s okay, but I must admit it’s a bit weird when a guy gets this assertive with me, especially when it’s not the usual type of male communication.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So it was Natsu after all. When I heard the description, I thought it might be.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Description? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The finger that was poking me slid sideways.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I peeked out into the corridor from the classroom door, there was the girl we’d been talking about with Himari earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, that black-haired girl.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hello.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With just that, the black-haired girl turned away coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then Makishima’s poking assault aimed at that girl’s forehead.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Rin-chan should be the one asking for a favor. Greet properly!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ow! Shi-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Shi-kun?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, ‘Shi’ for Shinji Makishima.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But can they not flirt in front of someone else’s classroom?</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re going to get glares from others… Wait? Why do I feel like a boomerang just flew back at me?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Makishima. What’s your relationship?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s the daughter of the Western-style confectionery shop behind my house. Simply put, she’s what you’d call a childhood friend. She’s one of the few women I’ve sworn not to lay a hand on. Please treat her well.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh. Thanks for the completely unnecessary information at the end.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Childhood friends of opposite genders really do exist in reality, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, Makishima has a high level of appearance and she’s also beautiful, they’re like a duo out of a manga.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I admired them, Himari reacted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, isn’t this Enocchi? Could it be the one Yuu mentioned is about Enocchi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The black-haired girl seemed to recognize Himari too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hi-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hi-chan? …Oh, ‘Hi’ for Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It suddenly felt like a nickname war.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…But seriously, doesn’t this circle of acquaintances seem too tight? Why does everyone except me know each other?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel a bit left out, can someone explain?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what’s your relationship?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu is related too. Remember, the younger sister of the model we were indebted to during the cultural festival?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then I understood.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was the Twitter model’s during the junior high school cultural festival that caused my flower accessory to sell out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s older brother was friends with that model, and through that connection, Himari and the black-haired girl probably got acquainted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari seems to have an insanely wide circle of friends.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, um…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Rion Enomoto.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, her name.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As one would expect from her appearance, it’s a cool name.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Enomoto-san, do you have business with me, not Himari?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked extremely displeased. It’s not like I was the one who called her…</p>
<p class="calibre5">This isn’t going anywhere. Sensing that, Makishima prompted her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Rin-chan, you better tell him what you want quickly. Natsu seems troubled, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shi-kun, I’ve told you to stop using that name…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, ‘Rin’ for Rion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder whose habit it is between Makishima and Enomoto-san to give such nicknames. Well, it doesn’t matter who.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Um, this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san held out both her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On her palms was something familiar.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That accessory from that time?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The Queen of the Night metal bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, its clasp is still broken. No wonder I thought she wasn’t wearing it on her left-hand today.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">While I was thinking that, Enomoto-san stated her business.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I called accessory shops and home centers, but they said they don’t repair items that aren’t from their brand. My friend also said it would be faster to buy a new one…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, so that’s how it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, she wants me to fix it like I said the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s good. I thought Makishima would tell me, ‘Don’t lay a hand on my girl.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">…uh, isn’t my imagination too old-fashioned? Is this some yakuza film or what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is after school today okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Mm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, Enomoto-san looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess that means she agrees.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’ll take it and…oh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I tried to take the accessory, she pulled her hand back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s wrong with her? How am I supposed to respond?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I just met her, so I haven’t got a read on her character yet. I wish she wouldn’t do something like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I’ll be troubled if it gets damaged, so I’ll keep it for now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t trust me, but it’s fine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t really care either way, and I’ll just take it as her valuing the item.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, will you come to the science room after school?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Mm.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seemed that today’s after-school would be different from usual.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">Later that day, after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While waiting for Enomoto-san in the science room, I asked Himari about her personality.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Himari and Enomoto-san are connected through your elder brother?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. We were close in elementary school, but not so much now. We were in different classes last year too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, so you went to the same elementary school?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not exactly. During elementary school, we were friends who played together a few times a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Like family gatherings?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, that’s close. But it’s not family, it’s because we ordered cake deliveries.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Cake?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Makishima also mentioned it, right? Enocchi’s family runs a western confectionery store.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So, they played together when Himari’s family ordered cakes from her family store.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi’s family’s cakes are really delicious. They have a good reputation in the neighborhood.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. I might want to try them.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We still order cakes from them, so how about you come to the next birthday party? My mom’s birthday is next month.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way. Why would a classmate come to your mom’s birthday party? That makes no sense.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“She’s been missing you recently, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Rather, that’s precisely why I don’t want to…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why are the people from that house so overly inviting towards me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if I went, how should I even respond with congratulatory remarks?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Returning to the topic of Enocchi, after that, we started hanging out when they delivered cakes. But, around the higher grades in elementary school, she suddenly stopped coming. We were in different school zones, so we didn’t meet at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Did you know she was attending our high school?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. We talked a few times in our first year.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I got a rough idea of their relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it’s impressive she remembers friends from such a young age.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As for me, I can only recall one or two people I played baseball with in elementary school… wait, isn’t that a bit too bad?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You attended different junior high schools?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. I think she got that Moonflower accessory through her elder sister.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, that sounds plausible.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Either way, she doesn’t seem like someone who’d have any connection with me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, about me being the creator?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I think it’s better not to mention it. Enocchi seems attached to that moonflower accessory, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t know about her being attached, but she does seem to cherish it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’d be a pity if you unintentionally tainted it with unnecessary thoughts.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, is the fact that I made it considered an ‘unnecessary thought’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not what I meant. People want to keep their precious memories intact, right? Regardless of the new information, there’s a possibility that it could ruin those memories. Isn’t it too insensitive to potentially pour cold water on such cherished memories?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ugh. She has a point.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to brag about it either, so I might as well keep it to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…As I was thinking about it, Himari, who misunderstood in a weird way, nudged me with her elbow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Heh, Yuu, you were trying to use this as an opportunity to pursue the beautiful, busty daughter of the cake shop owner, weren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not the case at all. And I wasn’t asking in that sense… wait, she’s busty?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s face turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Crossing her arms, she nodded and said, ‘Mmm.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a distant look, recalling something, she said nostalgically,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…They’re huge. I saw it during a joint physical education class in our first year, so there’s no mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hadn’t noticed since her uniform was baggy…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, even if I noticed, what does it matter?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d rather she not fill my head with weird thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“In elementary school, she looked as cute as a doll. And now, in high school, she’s become such a glamorous beauty. Ahh, truly my type…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. True, Himari, you do have a thing for that type of beauty. Kind of like my sisters’ vibe…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, exactly. I really like your sisters, Yuu. Beauties are the treasures of the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But still, this is the first time I’ve heard you mention Enomoto-san. Aren’t you two close?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She suddenly returned to her serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Leaning over the table, she spoke as if recalling a painful memory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’d like to be close, but she seems to be avoiding me a bit.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh, avoiding you? That’s unusual, considering you’re a social butterfly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, during the joint physical education class right after we entered high school, we were changing clothes together. And then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I got it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Specifically, from seeing Himari’s hands moving frantically, I can guess it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no need to tell me more. I have a bad feeling about this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It was just a moment of impulse! The chance to grab something so magnificent might only come once in a lifetime!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I told you not to say anymore! If you did something like that, no wonder she’s avoiding you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If something like that was in front of you, Yuu, you’d definitely grab it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I wouldn’t! What if someone heard you talking about that!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Amidst our noisy chatter, the science lab door suddenly opened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, it was Enomoto-san, and she stared at us with a cold expression.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">Could she have heard our earlier conversation? It’s not my fault, though…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still keeping her cool demeanor, Enomoto-san spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hello.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, hello…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hello…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t sure if that was the appropriate greeting for the situation, but it seemed like she hadn’t heard my conversation with Himari?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, where’s Makishima?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shi-kun has tennis club practice.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I see. I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s understandable for sports clubs to have practices, but honestly, I wish he were here to ease the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“E-Enomoto-san, what about your club?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m in the brass band club, but we’re off today.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I see. Uhm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s a suitable topic…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just as I started to panic, Enomoto-san presented her moonflower accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No need for small talk, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, understood…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t necessarily want to be close, but she’s so cold that it’s almost heartbreaking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hey, Himari, stop laughing! After all, there’s a chance she’s cautious because of your harassment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’ll get started…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had Enomoto-san sit in the chair in front of me and took the broken bracelet from her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First, I checked for damages.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As expected, the wear was on the joint parts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In simpler terms, the rings that were fitted together had rubbed against each other, reducing their durability.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This could be fixed by replacing the entire part.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately, I don’t have the exact same piece, but I have something similar in stock.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since it’s not the kind I bought from a hundred-yen store, its durability should be better than before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…With that in mind, I remembered Himari’s words from earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“E-Enomoto-san. Can I ask something?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You can’t fix it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She doesn’t trust me huh…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s understandable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To Enomoto-san, maybe I’m just some ‘weirdo who seems good with his hands.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it wasn’t for Himari or Makishima, she probably wouldn’t have asked me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, no, I mean, this is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Can you be clear?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san crossed her arms and impatiently tapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s really irritated… and seriously, I can see it now that her chest is huge.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like it’s going to spill out from her arms… Wait, that’s not important.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Damn you, Himari, for planting weird thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At that moment, Himari intervened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Stop-stop. Enocchi, you’re kinda scary right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Hi-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seemed a bit dissatisfied, but she stopped her attack on me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu is a bit timid, you know. He’s actually trying his best even with someone he’s meeting for the first time. Can’t you be a little kinder?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not angry, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Still, Enocchi, you’ve been frowning so much, you know? Look at this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…ah!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was suddenly shown a hand mirror, which made Enomoto-san jump in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Inadvertently leaning back, she began to fall backward while her flailing arms hit nothing but air.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Enocchi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, wait, I, …aahhh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She toppled over, chair and all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari and I stared in shock….In moments like this, one’s body just freezes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, are you okay!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari and I rushed to help her up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thankfully, it didn’t seem like she hit her head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, she had banged her elbow hard, causing her eyes to tear up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Ugh, uuu…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“E-Enocchi? I’m sorry, are you okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Enomoto-san shouted loudly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You said you could fix it, so hurry up and fix it!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I got it. It was my fault…(?)”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Who would have thought she’d fall that dramatically…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is she actually…? What do you call it, uh…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi, you’re still as clumsy as ever.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That Himari, always speaking her mind!</p>
<p class="calibre5">In response, Enomoto-san’s face turned beet red and she retorted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That was Hi-chan’s fault!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I mean, seriously? …Pfff!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“~~~!!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san’s right arm swiftly grabbed Himari’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She began to squeeze it tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari let out a muffled scream, ‘Mogyyaa!’, while desperately tapping on that arm.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan, I really hate you! You’ve always lacked tact since forever! You’ve taken all my favorite keychains and dolls!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mercy! Enocchi, I give up! That iron claw is deadly! The strength you’ve honed from baking shouldn’t be used like this! My skull is screaming!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up! I’ll settle the grudges I’ve held since elementary school right here!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry-sorry! I promise I won’t do it again, please!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Incredible…</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is the first time I’ve seen Himari being treated like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Given they are old friends, it seems that Enomoto-san is one of those people unaffected by Himari’s usual charm…</p>
<p class="calibre5">This stance, I kind of want to take a page from her book.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Upon releasing Himari, Enomoto-san glared sharply at me, an intimidating aura about her like that of a wrathful deity.(TN: 般若 (hannya).</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun, fix it now!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I understand. I’ll do it right away.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hurriedly picked up the broken accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt sorry for Enomoto-san, but the atmosphere did lighten up a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Realizing she’s the type that’s had her fair share of struggles with Himari eased my tension.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, I didn’t want this kind of buffer between us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Before repairing, I just want to check with you. I can fix it, but I think I’ll have to replace a part. I’d like you to agree to that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh… Can’t you just fix it as it is?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh no, she seems very reluctant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This part… was originally bought at a hundred-yen store. Those stores frequently change their stock, so I doubt they still have a part from two years ago.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…it was bought at a hundred-yen store?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I just meant it looked like something from there.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Close call, close call.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t think I have to hide it, but Himari and I decided so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">In any case, Enomoto-san was reluctant about the part replacement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She probably has some sentimental attachment to it. Himari seemed to sense this too and was unsure how to persuade her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, it’s true that the exact same part is hard to get by.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One of the main reasons accessory shops and home centers declined the repair was this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could inquire with the hundred-yen store about the manufacturer of the part… but there’s a high chance that the production line has ended.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s unlikely they would manufacture a part just for this repair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The part is likely produced overseas, and whether that manufacturer still exists is questionable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To fix this, I’ll need Enomoto-san to compromise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If she can’t, even I wouldn’t be able to repair it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“The resin of this ‘Queen of the Night’ will remain intact. I can promise that. And if I assemble it with a more durable part, I believe it’ll last even longer in the future.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If that’s not possible… how about placing it in a collection case and displaying it in your room? I believe I can also craft an ornament that aligns closely with your preferences.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She compared the bracelet and my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her expression was reminiscent of a young child in indecision.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She might have given off a tough first impression, but she might be quite innocent at heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, she was playing along nicely with Himari earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While I was pondering this, Enomoto-san said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I want to wear this.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, can I replace the parts?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Umm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…This took longer than I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I’m really tired just from this. I’m not usually the type to listen to someone’s preferences about accessories, and I feel like I just want to go home and take a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, most of this exhaustion might be because of Himari, though.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll start preparing right away. Please wait a moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I unlocked the steel shelf behind me and took out a cardboard box with tools.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This also contains a case with a stockpile of materials.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From within, I selected a metal stick that closely matched the color and shape of the bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s coral-colored and roughly one centimeter long, cylindrical in shape.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I placed it on the table as a placeholder, trying to envision how it would look once connected.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Does this look good to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Umm…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’d like to measure your wrist size.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Is this fine?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She wrapped a measuring tape around her left wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s almost the same as Himari’s, but for Enomoto-san, a little extra might go better with her fashion style.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, I’ll start the work.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…alright. Please go ahead.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">First, I need to disassemble the ‘Queen of the Night’ bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although I say that, it’s quite simple. I just snip it with a thin-bladed pair of pliers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no need to exert too much force since it was already deteriorating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, I must be careful not to damage the resin of the ‘Queen of the Night’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even though it’s a simple task, I proceed with caution.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, who linked these parts so intricately? Oh right, it was me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Done.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since I’ve gone this far, I should probably also maintain the resin part… but she might feel uncomfortable if I touch it too much.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good thinking on my part. I’m quite considerate. Now for the joint part…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, Hi-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s your relationship with this guy?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Are you curious? Could it be… do you have a thing for Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I’m not! I was just a bit curious!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. It’s a bit sad when you deny it so strongly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, who is he?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He’s my best friend from middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Best friend?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. Is that weird?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No. So what are you two doing in this science lab?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’re part of the gardening club,&nbsp; and we’re growing flowers inside these shelves. We’ve also planted various things in the flower bed behind the bike parking lot. Look inside the shelf, see?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow! What’s this? There are flower buds lined up inside this round, cute container…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s an LED planter. It’s an excellent device that allows you to grow plants indoors, even in places with limited sunlight. It’s also convenient for keeping the freshness of leafy vegetables like lettuce.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Amazing. I didn’t know something like this existed…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the way, I haven’t watered the plants today. Enocchi, want to give it a try?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Um, okay then…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Here you go, this is ‘Jouro’. Each flower has a name, so call out to them and say ‘you’re so cute’ as you water them. Flowers are pure beings after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I, I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“From here in order, it’s ‘Akari’, ‘Izumi’, ‘Ui’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Akari-chan, Izumi-chan, Ui-chan… Y-you’re so cute…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right! Good job! Next up are the ‘Kekekekeke’ and ‘Kokokokoko’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They sound like Pokemon that have been collected for their individual values!? (TN: IVs)”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha! I admit I couldn’t remember all of them. But Yuu has them all memorized perfectly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu’s really smart when it comes to things he’s interested in, even more so than me. It’s such a waste.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But Hi-chan, I’ve never heard of a gardening club…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess so, because Yuu and I started it last year and we haven’t recruited any members yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you do in the club?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Usually, we observe and nurture flowers. We compile reports on flowers that can be easily grown indoors. We claim it’s for therapeutic purposes, saying it contributes to social welfare.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“For ‘therapeutic purposes’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you remember the flowers decorating the school gate during last year’s graduation ceremony? Those were flowers we raised.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, the ones the seniors were plucking as souvenirs after the ceremony?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Exactly those. I don’t really mind it that much, but I wish they had taken them more gently.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I finished linking the metal sticks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yeah, it should look something like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Next is to connect it with the resin part…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan, this guy hasn’t responded at all since a while ago…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu is always like this. When he’s working on something, he wouldn’t even notice if a vase broke next to him.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…have you tried that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. Last year, when I was changing the water for the flowers, I accidentally did it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“He can’t even hear our conversation right now, and he wouldn’t even notice if you touched him. Want to try?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just like this. If you do this here…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wa-wait, isn’t that a bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe. Oh, I need to take a picture too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wha- Hi-chan, won’t he get mad later…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Finished.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For now, it should be okay.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had more time, I could have been more meticulous… No, I promised Himari that I’d keep it simple.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I just hope this will be satisfactory.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt something strange on my head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Specifically, it felt like my hair was being pulled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Himari handed me a hand mirror.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here you go, Yuu. Check the mirror♪”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, my hair was tied up with countless red ribbons.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Aaaahhhhhhhhhhh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but scream at the sight.</p>
<p class="calibre5">These are the ribbons I had prepared for accessory packaging!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what did you do!!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehe, you screamed like a girl, Yuu… Pffhahaha!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Pointing at me, Himari burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hurriedly tried to untie the ribbons, but my hair was tangled, and I couldn’t get them off.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Damn it, I can’t get these off! Fix this!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I got it-I got it. I’ll untie them, you just keep working on what you were doing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even though she was the one who did this in the first place…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari started to untie the ribbons from behind me. Leaving that to her, I held out a bracelet to Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, Enomoto-san, I’d like you to try it on for now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then she wraps the bracelet around her wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The size is as expected. All that remains is the comfort.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I inadvertently lifted my gaze and our eyes met.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For a moment, her cheeks seemed to puff out, and then she suddenly burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t laugh! Hey, Himari! Hurry up and get it off!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From behind me, Himari groaned.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, I’m sorry. I know I did this, but it’s hard to untie.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you seriously saying that?!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. If these ribbons aren’t untied by the time you’re 30… Hmm, maybe you should shave your head.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is the part where you should be saying ‘I’ll take responsibility!’, okay? Don’t just dodge responsibility when it’s important!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s cheeks turned a shade of red.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Huh, Yuu. If you’re really single until you’re 30, do you plan on being with me? …Should I tell Onii-chan then?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Stop trying to pass the responsibility to your brother while acting shy!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I really wonder if he’ll ever get married. I definitely don’t want to take care of him in his old age.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You can’t just throw that responsibility onto a complete stranger!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sometimes, Yuu, you can be so selfish.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Who’s the selfish one here, me?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As we were talking like this, a smile unexpectedly slipped from Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fufu, ahaha. It’s definitely Hi-chan’s fault… fufu.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We were taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Contrary to her previous caution, she showed a childlike grin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I looked back at Himari, she smugly said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“See? Thanks to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…You totally just made that up on the spot, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, the lightened atmosphere is a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After verifying the bracelet’s size, I moved on to attaching the final clasp.</p>

<p class="calibre5">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Hi-chan. What’s your relationship with Natsume-kun?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Enoch said that…</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest… it irked me a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now that we’re on the subject, I’m going to make it clear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t see Yuu in a romantic sense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, I don’t really understand love. Is it even that important?</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Are you dating Natsume-kun, Himari-san?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since I started hanging out with Yuu, I’ve been asked this hundreds of times. I’m tired of hearing it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">First and foremost, it’s one thing if a classmate asks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s understandable that they’d be curious, but sometimes, even students from other grades, whom I don’t even know by name, will suddenly come up and interrogate me with, 『What’s your relationship with Natsume-kun?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Isn’t that a bit too much?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was asked at the committee meeting the day before yesterday too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A senior in the third year… what was his name? Uh, who was it again? Oh well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Everyone other than Yuu doesn’t really matter to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, a rather good-looking senpai (well, relatively), said that to me out of the blue.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re often with that tall boy, aren’t you? Don’t you think you’re a bit mismatched?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I replied with a smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Does that have anything to do with you, Senpai?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The rather clueless senpai realized I didn’t have any thoughts about him and hurriedly made his escape.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It really sickens me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I mean, isn’t that wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shouldn’t the first thing be to ask what kind of person Yuu is? Is Yuu’s worth determined by whether he’s dating me or not?</p>

<p class="calibre5">So ridiculous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those who don’t understand Yuu’s worth have no right to deny my worth, and at the same time, they have no right to impose other values onto me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can there be a friendship between a man and a woman?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If not, then what are these feelings?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is my desire to support Yuu’s dreams merely a means to get closer for a kiss or something more intimate?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s absurd. If I wanted to kiss Yuu, I wouldn’t be going about it in such a roundabout way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was fed up with such people.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t intend to deny their love-struck attitudes, but at least I don’t want them projecting that onto us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want them to realize not everyone shares the same values, and, ideally, whoever becomes Yuu’s girlfriend, I hope they recognize and accept our unique values.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because saying goodbye just because you got a lover is, in its own way, lonely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I thought about this, the sky clouded over and it began to rain.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It coincided with the moment Yuu finished the bracelet.</p>

<p class="calibre5">After leaving the science lab, the three of us changed our shoes at the entrance and stood still, gazing blankly at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu looked up at the drizzling rain with an expression as if the world was ending.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. Wasn’t it supposed to be clear all day?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, they said it’d cloud over in the evening.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? I didn’t check properly…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But the rain symbol was supposed to start after midnight. It seems today’s weather forecast was almost accurate.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, what to do? Well, with things like this, the outcome is predictable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I expected, Yuu took action.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m on my bike, so I’ll head home first. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t we take the bus together?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine. There isn’t a bus at a good time for me tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: He doesnt want to take the bus because he can’t leave his bicycle overnight; he needs it tomorrow morning.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, he quickly left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can tell he’s lying just a little.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The truth is, he’s shy because Enocchi is around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu has a low immunity to girls. He probably can’t stand being in the same space as a girl he doesn’t know well.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">(At this rate, it might be a long time before Yuu gets a girlfriend…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">…That’s why I was surprised when Yuu approached Enocchi himself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even more surprisingly, Yuu was able to converse without looking away right from the first meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even considering the matter of the flower accessory, it’s still rare.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But when I learned that it was Enocchi, I could understand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She’s genuinely beautiful. She really stands out from those who only have an average appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say she’s the next cutest after me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Yuu’s ‘mild discomfort around girls’ is the hurdle, she has the potential to blow that away in an instant.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Good face, good figure. It’s easy to misunderstand, but she’s actually incredibly kind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even when I play pranks on her, she always forgives me in the end. That’s why I feel at ease around her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, coming from a family that owns a Western confectionery shop, she’s apparently good at cooking too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s truly the type of girl one would want to marry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Could it be that spring has come for Yuu?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hmm. But Yuu is just… like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, I sometimes think he might really only be interested in flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In terms of magnets, it feels like they’re both the same pole.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If one of them took the initiative, maybe there’s a chance?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi’s vibe doesn’t entirely feel like she’s uninterested.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She never shows a smile to someone she truly can’t stand, no matter what.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hii-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was nodding to myself, Enocchi spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hm? Oh, sorry, what was that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I checked the bus schedule. The next one is coming soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, right. Then let’s go home together.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Holding my folded umbrella, the two of us headed to the bus stop in front of the school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sharing an umbrella with a beauty. Hehehe. I’m totally scoring big here. Sorry, Yuu. I really feel bad.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thanks for getting wet and heading home alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hope you won’t catch a cold tomorrow.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Hii-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You haven’t been listening to me since a while ago. What’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I was just wondering if Yuu is okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t really say I was admiring Enocchi. She might get creeped out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Beauty is a treasure of the world, and admiring it has nothing to do with gender.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I just want to take her home and pamper her at my place until she’s completely relaxed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…by the way, lately Yuu hasn’t been coming to my house.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s puberty, so it can’t be helped, but it’s a bit lonely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My family is also waiting for Yuu to come over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu probably has a personality that fits right into the Inuzuka family’s DNA.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…that….hello?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa! Sorry, Enocchi. I wasn’t listening again!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oops. She looks really angry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi has never been straightforward, but her feelings show on her face easily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, but this piercing gaze is kind of… addicting. I might develop a strange taste.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi repeated herself with an adorably sulking expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hii-chan, are you really not dating that guy?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Which guy?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Natsume-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm~~?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oh, I see…</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was suspecting something between Yuu and Enocchi, it seems Enocchi was suspecting something between Yuu and me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“We’re not dating. We’re seriously just best friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You mentioned something about getting married earlier…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. That was just a joke. Everyone in our class heard it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But for a boy and a girl to be together so closely…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If you say that, doesn’t it mean every guy and girl who were friends in the world are doing intimate things?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ugh. Well, I guess so…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Cute!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just say the word ‘intimate’ and she turns red is very-very cute!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Despite your modern-looking appearance, are you really so innocent?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, I want to take her home. I want to take a bath together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to enjoy that kind of communication, envied by the boys, using the privilege of being a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it’s not that I can only love the same gender, okay?</p>

<p class="calibre5">『People should be honest with their desire to admire beauty.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s my motto.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And that’s the fundamental reason I’m helping Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I wouldn’t exactly call Yuu a pretty boy. Normal? Decent?</p>
<p class="calibre5">We’ve been friends for so long that I can’t really judge anymore. I think he’s not bad.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s not even about that, it’s about those eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love the rainbow-colored shimmer in his eyes when he’s making flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t really know why, but I love it to death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It resonates even deeper than the Inuzuka family DNA.</p>

<p class="calibre5">They feel like marbles that are burning with all the passion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re beautiful, but at the same time, they’re fragile, like they could break if I touch them recklessly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s the value of Yuu to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I probably will never be able to leave Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I think we’ll always be best friends. That’ll only end… probably when Yuu stops making flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In other words, I’ll always help Yuu.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This feeling is probably incomprehensible to others. That’s why I don’t often speak of it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">People attack what they don’t understand because of these marine blue eyes, I know this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In any case, I want to keep sitting in this ‘special seat reserved just for me.’ forever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hii-chan!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, sorry! …What was it? Has the bus arrived? Coming to my place? Taking a bath together?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t get that last part…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Oops. I was too honest with my desires.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ah, don’t be so taken aback. The widening distance between us feels cold.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s okay, I won’t hurt you….tat wasn’t reassuring at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hii-chan. Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked serious. Maybe this is a serious conversation?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sure. Consult this ‘Onee-san’. If it’s within the range where my grandfather and brother’s influence reaches, I’ll listen to anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hii-chan, you’ve had boyfriends before, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s out of the blue. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I mean, you seem like the type who would be popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“True that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re not denying it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t deny it because it’s true. Being modest would sound insincere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But boyfriends, huh? …She’s coming at this from an unexpected angle.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I get into relationships often, but they usually end quickly. It’s almost like I date to break up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Date to break up…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know, there are people who are too pushy, even if you reject them. So, I date them for a bit, let them realize we’re a terrible match, and then it’s easier to break it off without any lingering issues.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“From my experience, it’s riskier to outright reject someone pushy when they confess. So, I even have a separate phone for such situations. I give those bothersome people that line number, and later I just say, ‘My parents confiscate my phone at night,’ so I don’t have to reply to their messages.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow… That’s amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not that great. I can’t hang out with Yuu during those times. It’s really stressful, and if it becomes a big issue, it would bother my brother as well, so it’s tough for me too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Being born with the fate of being popular comes with its own set of troubles. It’s really bothersome.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No matter how soon I break up, I usually can’t replenish my ‘dose of Yuu’ for about a week.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Moreover, Yuu will also say things like, ‘Broke up again? You really can’t keep a relationship&mdash;&mdash;’ which is a bit annoying.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, with all that said, think I can give advice to Enochi?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, um…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Choosing her words carefully, Enochi spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Among them, have there been people who confessed to you without even knowing your face?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Excuse me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That was entirely unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By ‘among them,’ she’s probably referring to my string of ex-boyfriends (lol).</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t remember all of them, but someone confessed without even seeing my face… Wait, what kind of situation is that?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oh, like acquaintances from the internet?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not really acquaintances…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Huh!? Not even acquaintances?</p>
<p class="calibre5">So it’s more like a one-way thing. In that case…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, like an actor or a comedian?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s somewhat close to that feeling, I guess…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But they don’t even know your face? What’s going on?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The more I think about it, the less I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so frustrated that I gave Enochi’s back a light slap.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you have something to say, say it clearly!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ouch… Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Resigning herself, Enochi finally got to the point.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Our family owns a Western confectionery shop, right? Onee-chan always wanted to go to the city, so I thought I’d take over the shop…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Whoa. We suddenly went from love talk to a very serious topic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love how, despite being cute, she seems a bit socially awkward, just like Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Enochi takes over the shop, I’ve decided that the Inuzuka family should keep a close relationship with them. I decided that now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then? And then?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When I was helping with making sweets, my mom often said, ‘Even a bad person can make something good. But only someone with a kind heart can create something that resonates with others.’ I guess she wanted to tell me to become a kind-hearted person…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah. I see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I kind of get what she’s trying to say.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, did you find something that resonated with your heart? And even though you’ve never seen his face, you fell in love, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yes, something like that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She averted her gaze and blushed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hmm. It seems she’s seriously into it, but she’s so cute.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it okay to be this cute? Enochi in this moment seems to have surpassed me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sorry, Yuu. I was thinking there might be a chance for you earlier, but this doesn’t seem promising.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately for you, this endearing beauty seems to have someone else in mind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Tough luck. You’re too early for love. Let’s enjoy our youth as best friends for a while longer!</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was amusing myself with these thoughts about Yuu, Enocchi spoke up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t know what that person looked like, but I had a feeling that person was close by…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because that person was always in your Instagram pictures.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That person was…in my Instagram pictures?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait, what? What does that even mean?</p>
<p class="calibre5">My Instagram is for promoting those flower accessories, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Who else was in those photos?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could this be some kind of horror story?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Scary. Hold on, I can’t handle horror, Enochi, it’s a bit much to drop something like that so suddenly…</p>

<p class="calibre5">(──Ah, I get it now.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">That person was close by. That person is always there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi didn’t specifically say ‘a boy was in the picture.’ From her story, she doesn’t even know the face of this person.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But she knows this person icon. Something they made that stole her heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Um, Enocchi? Why did you suddenly tell me that? I thought you said you disliked me. In school, you were always avoiding me…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enochi slowly raised her left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On her wrist was a bracelet of the ‘Queen of the Night’ flower.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A flower that blooms beautifully in one night and fades by the next.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Its floral language signifies ‘Glamorous Beauty,’ ‘Fleeting Love’──’Just once, I Wish to See You’</p>
