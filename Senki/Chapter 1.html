<h2>Chapter 1: The Weakest Esper</h2>


<p>It was early spring, entrance ceremony day.</p>
<p>Refreshing sunlight streamed in through the windows. Cherry blossom petals danced in the chilly air that still retained hints of winter on this quintessential spring day. In contrast to the springlike atmosphere outside, the stifling gymnasium was filled with new students. Looking over the printed materials handed out to them, I frowned.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a really bad feeling about this…”</p>
<p>I was assigned to Class 1-C. With my surname starting with ‘A’, I could only clearly see the students lined up in front of me from Classes A and B. Despite the sense of unease the handouts gave them, they seemed full of anticipation for the new school life ahead.</p>
<p>Private Senei Academy  High School.</p>
<p>Built using cutting-edge technology to develop supernatural abilities known as ‘esper powers’, which are then granted to the students to promote more well-rounded, substantive growth compared to previous eras…or so the brochure said, if I remember correctly. But this is…</p>
<p>“Not good.”</p>
<p>The school was established just two years ago. The current third-years were the first batch, so there wasn’t much information about the school. I recalled the sole piece of news – the ‘Disappearance of Students Expelled from the Academy’ incident.</p>
<p>…That was proven to be totally unfounded, with articles published to that effect too.</p>
<p>And so, lured by the promise of ‘esper abilities’, we resolved to enroll.</p>
<p>The disappearances were just a rumor. Senei Academy  was a perfectly normal high school.</p>
<p>That’s what I believed, anyway.</p>
<p>“Now that the printouts have been distributed, let me briefly explain,”</p>
<p>A voice amplified through the mic suddenly echoed through the gym.</p>
<p>Looking up at the stage, a man stood in front of a podium.</p>
<p>Wearing a well-fitted suit, he had slicked-back silver hair.</p>
<p>The deep wrinkles on his face accentuated his mature visage, yet his smile somehow reassured all who saw it.</p>
<p>The principal – Yagumo Sento. That was the man’s name.</p>
<p>“To put it simply, just follow your teacher’s instructions and the school rules, and you’ll have a successful school life. It’s not complicated, just like elementary and middle school. The only difference is – yes, you all have esper abilities now.”</p>
<p>Espers. The kind you see in anime and manga and stuff.</p>
<p>Apparently I already had this ability innately. To be honest, even after hearing about my power I still didn’t feel anything, but excitement spread through the students.</p>
<p>They probably already knew their own powers. Whether they’d be honest about them or exaggerate to seem stronger… Well, I doubt there’d be any weirdos who’d undersell their own powers, but our daily lives were definitely about to change dramatically just by having these abilities.</p>
<p>“What the school wants is for you to have fulfilling school lives. Use your powers enthusiastically in your studies and club activities. The better your results, the higher your grades and allowances will be, so your efforts will directly benefit you.”</p>
<p>The principal smiled again.</p>
<p>“So follow the rules and revel in your school lives!”</p>
<p>His smile remained warm and reassuring.</p>
<p>Glancing around, I could see students breathing sighs of relief. A handful had complicated expressions though… I wondered what would happen next.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze back to the brochure and sighed quietly.</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>That night, in the private room assigned to each student, I looked over the brochure.</p>
<p>The school grounds were apparently over twice the size of Tokyo. Of course it had school buildings and dorms, but also thriving dairy and farming industries, unbelievable gigantic shopping malls, amusement parks, resort hotels… Which does make me wonder why they’d provide resort hotels for the students…</p>
<p>“Wow, incredible.”</p>
<p>Our tuition and living expenses could be earned within the school too.</p>
<p>With such ideal conditions it was like a paradise, but naturally this much preferential treatment came with a hidden dark side.</p>
<p>The smartphone-like ‘Student Handbook’ that was distributed along with the brochure in the gym.</p>

<p>When I turned it on, my photo appeared on the screen along with my name, age, gender, and the living allowance provided by the school – ‘¥499,431’. The odd amount was because I’d bought dinner at the campus store on the way back to the dorm.</p>
<p>The smartphone also contained ID, credit card, phone, game functions and more. Since it was a smartphone after all.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, this was a ‘Student Handbook’ through and through.</p>
<p>I slid my finger to open the handbook app and was greeted by walls of text under the heading [School Rules].</p>
<p>Skimming through it, I had to hold my forehead.</p>
<p>…How many other students realized the school’s malicious intent at this stage?</p>
<p>After we dispersed from the gym yesterday, I recalled the chatter I’d heard from the other new first-years. They were probably absorbed with the gaming and phone functions, not even glancing at the handbook.</p>
<p>Plus there was the matter of esper abilities.</p>
<p>Some would try out their powers, some would immediately start training, some might already have skillful control. Amidst all that, someone who didn’t even look at the game functions, made no connections with their new classmates, paid no attention to their esper power, and was intently reading the handbook from 8pm the night before school even started – there probably weren’t many pathetic guys like me.</p>
<p>Well, maybe a handful including me.</p>
<p>The terrible malice lurking beneath this facade of goodwill and preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Whether you noticed it or not would completely change your school life starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Well, and”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, or luckily, I happened to catch on, but I hadn’t exchanged contacts with any classmates to warn them…</p>
<p>I glanced at the clock on the wall. It showed ‘7:58pm’. I plugged in the handbook to charge and turned off all the other lights in the room.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, in total darkness, I read out that one passage from the screen reflected in my eyes.</p>
<p>“Article 3. Bedtime is strictly 8pm. Those who have their room lights on past that time will be subject to a ¥100,000 fine, expulsion, or other measures.”</p>
<p>I turned off the smartphone and collapsed into bed.</p>
<p>The living allowance periodically deposited based on our grades. With the ‘period’ still unclear this early on before school had even started and my initial funds untouched, losing a fifth of my balance – ¥100,000 – would be incredibly painful.</p>
<p>“This sure is an unusual place.”</p>
<p>I muttered and closed my eyes. I had a bad feeling things would go crazy starting tomorrow, but for now, I’d just attend school broadcasting my ‘victim’ status. Blend into the crowd during conspicuous times – that was the safest approach.</p>
<p>With that resolve, I slipped under the covers.</p>
<p>The night before my first day of school… looked like I’d sleep soundly after all.</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>The next day. I put on the brand new uniform and followed the same route to school I took just yesterday.</p>
<p>I had breakfast from the convenience store, by the way. We got a ¥500,000 starting stipend after all. Avoiding the fine and with prudent living, I should be able to get by for some time.</p>
<p>There were students heading to the school building here and there around me.</p>
<p>None of them showed anger or impatience, maybe they hadn’t even noticed their money was gone. I tilted my head in realization.</p>
<p>“Ah, second or third-years, huh.”</p>
<p>The tie/ribbon colors differed by grade – green for second-years, blue for third-years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile ours were red.</p>
<p>No wonder they were so carefree. I blended into the stream of students and headed into the school building.</p>
<p>But I soon noticed an anomaly.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>I arrived at the entrance I used yesterday, but there wasn’t a single first-year around.</p>
<p>Checking the shoe lockers for Class 1-C… all the indoor shoes had been switched to outdoor shoes, except mine. Did everyone arrive already? I shouldn’t be late though…</p>
<p>I checked my smartphone – it showed ‘7:58am’.</p>
<p>Classes didn’t start for over thirty minutes…</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that was a school rule too.”</p>
<p>Showing up an hour early or face immediate expulsion, or something.</p>
<p>I didn’t memorize all the rules so I was getting worried.</p>
<p>I had a bad feeling about this but went along with it anyway.</p>
<p>With no particular hurry, I slowly headed to my classroom.</p>
<p>And then, a few minutes later, angry yells echoed through the school.</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>“Huh… Don’t be silly, oi!”</p>
<p>“Ugh… Seriously, are you kidding me?”</p>
<p>I could hear that rough voice loud and clear—it’s from Class 1-C… Wait, that’s my class.</p>
<p>Feeling like I wanted to leave before my first class even began was a new experience for me.</p>
<p>I quietly reached the front of the classroom, trying not to make a sound, and peeked in through the gap in the door.</p>
<p>A male student was kicking chairs and desks around, aggressively confronting a female teacher.</p>
<p>Despite trying to hold the male student back, a female student turned to the teacher with a confused expression.</p>
<p>Another male student, his arms crossed with an intimidating air, stared down the teacher.</p>
<p>A female student sat down at her desk, closing her eyes and straightening her back as if to ignore everything.</p>
<p>Amidst all these negative gazes, the teacher maintained a faint smile.</p>
<p>Hmm, is this a class meltdown? Should I just head back home?</p>

<p>“I had a feeling it would turn out like this.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a calm voice echoed, carrying a sense of composure.</p>
<p>“You guys were bound to protest. That’s why I’ve come to the class earlier than expected, to deal with it properly.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s the deal about breaking school rules? You’re telling me that just because I didn’t sleep at 8, they deduct 100,000 yen from my pocket? Give back the money you took from me, dammit!”</p>
<p>The male student yelled back at the composed female teacher.</p>
<p>He seemed like he was about to charge at her any moment. Watching through the door, I fidgeted restlessly. A female student held him back, giving the teacher a troubled look.</p>
<p>“U-um, sensei… The truth is, everyone has the same opinion as Kiri—uh, I mean, Kiri-kun. It’s a bit excessive to impose a 100,000 yen fine for not turning off the lights at 8 AM… We know we’re at fault for not reading the school rules properly, but…”</p>
<p>As she spoke, about eighty percent of the silent students nodded along.</p>
<p>Her ponytail and bright chestnut hair, her charming double-toothed smile peeping out from her lips—contrasting her sporty appearance, her demeanor was soft, quite fitting for a class representative. However…</p>
<p>“Kurashiki Hotaru… I understand. But you all knew the consequences for not reading the rules. It’s your own fault.”</p>
<p>At her words, a sense of freezing spread through the entire class.</p>
<p>The atmosphere became tense in an instant. And, in the midst of it, I began to seriously consider heading back.</p>
<p>…Nah, impossible. I don’t have the courage to swing open the classroom door in this atmosphere.</p>
<p>Seriously, I wish they wouldn’t have this class meltdown without me.</p>
<p>If it’s going to collapse anyway, I wish they had at least waited for me to enter the classroom.</p>
<p>As I smoothed out the wrinkles between my brows, the male student referred to as Kirido let out a shout.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you to quit messing around! What school rules? You’ve been saying that all this time, but I’ve never heard any of it! You just suddenly throw this stuff at us—”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard? Isn’t it strange? Didn’t Headmaster announce it?”</p>
<p>The female teacher’s voice overlaid the male student’s voice, resonating across the room, reminding me of the Headmaster’s words.</p>
<p>“…That guy never explicitly mentioned the school rules.”</p>
<p>But I still think he must have touched upon that ‘fragment’ for sure.</p>
<p>Because those words the school principal said last――</p>
<p>“Adhere to the rules and enjoy a better school life.”</p>
<p>It sounded like a typical phrase from the school principal, as if he was the very embodiment of it.</p>
<p>But what happens when you take the meaning of those words at face value?</p>
<p>“…Hey, didn’t he say it? Follow the rules.”</p>
<p>Kiri-boy stuttered in response to those words.</p>
<p>Certainly, the school principal’s words must have remained in his memory.</p>
<p>That’s right, after creating such a sense of foreboding with the student handbook, he then offered his own ‘sweet words’. Students who had such a sense of foreboding couldn’t forget it, especially that level of sweetness.</p>
<p>That’s why there was no room for argument. In the realm of logic, emotional arguments like his wouldn’t hold up.</p>
<p>The female teacher smiled thinly at Kiri-boy’s silence and then scanned the entire class with her gaze.</p>
<p>“Well then, the start couldn’t have been worse. You foolish lot have managed to fail spectacularly at the starting line. I will be taking charge of your class starting today. My name is Rei Sakaki.”</p>
<p>And so, with me still absent, the curtain of school life was drawn.</p>
<p>…But the problem is not the classroom chaos, but the timing of my appearance.</p>
<p>In which scene and with what attitude should I make my entrance? It’s a bit of a high hurdle for me… Should I go back seriously? Maybe it’s better to start fresh today.</p>
<p>As I was contemplating all this, I heard the voice of the teacher named Sakaki from the class.</p>
<p>“…So, we’ve finished our self-introduction. It seems there’s one person who hasn’t arrived yet, though. Hey, the guy in the hallway.”</p>





<p>When I turned my gaze towards the classroom, our eyes met squarely.</p>
<p>…I wonder when she noticed. It’s a little embarrassing, but thanks to her, I got my chance to make my entrance. The class atmosphere is still terrible, but if I miss this opportunity, the timing might never come again.</p>
<p>Summoning my courage, I opened the door and stepped into the classroom.</p>
<p>“…Yuuto Amamori. He was one of the only four students in the year who managed to avoid breaking the school rules this time. Just when you thought you were lucky to avoid a rule violation, you appear at the worst possible moment… I don’t know if you’re lucky or unlucky.”</p>
<p>“…I think the same about myself.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was exposed as someone who had “avoided breaking the rules,” and skeptical glances from the entire class gathered on me. Even if they look at me as if to say, “Why didn’t you tell us?” Or something like that. Is there anyone in this class who exchanged contact information with me? Probably not.</p>
<p>Ignoring the gazes, I sat down according to the seating chart posted on the blackboard.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement seemed simple, following a numerical order separated by gender.</p>
<p>The desks are arranged with the boys whose surnames start with ‘A’, headed by me, Amamori, lined up vertically along the windows, and the girls lined up vertically next to them according to seating order.</p>
<p>So this time I was able to secure a position by the window in the very front, which tends to be a blind spot for the teacher during class, but… the countless stares stabbing into my back are a little painful.</p>
<p>“Now that everyone has gathered, time for self-introductions. One by one, state your name and granted ‘esper ability’, and feel free to add anything else you want to say. I should note there is no need whatsoever to honestly reveal your ability. Boasting of a stronger power to make a stronger impression is one strategy. Though if your lies are exposed later, your credibility will plummet.”</p>
<p>The students had varied reactions to those words.</p>
<p>Kirido, who had an unpleasant sneer when it was mentioned to boast about strong powers, now had a blue face at the part about credibility plummeting. And Kurashiki, the class rep-like girl from before, was frowning as if struggling over it.</p>
<p>And amidst all that, a girl sitting next to me caught my eye.</p>
<p>Lustrous black hair flowing down to her waist. Her firmly shut eyelids didn’t allow a single emotion to be read. Yet even with closed eyes, a sense of beauty could be felt.</p>
<p>Her straight back and textbook perfect posture.</p>
<p>It was like a marble sculpture.</p>
<p>Such a paragon of ‘beauty’ was sitting right beside me.</p>
<p>…Well, fancy talk aside, she was incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>And seeing how still her torso was, she must be quite athletic. That was my honest impression. Nothing else really. Though with how bizarrely still she remained in this situation, I felt she stood out a bit too much in this class.</p>
<p>As I watched her, I suddenly recalled something.</p>
<p>That there were four of us who avoided violating the school rules, including me.</p>
<p>“Then starting from seating order, Amamori, you start.”</p>
<p>At those words, countless stares gathered on me again. Roughly half were the same piercing gazes as before. Getting this hated on the first day, I smiled wryly inside and stood up.</p>
<p>My name and esper ability, right? I had nothing in particular to tell my classmates, but… Keeping it simple for now should be fine.</p>
<p>Giving up on thinking too hard, I just stated it bluntly.</p>
<p>“I’m Amamori Yuuto. My esper power is [Worsening Eyesight]. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>I sat back down to a frozen classroom behind me.</p>
<p>My power is [Worsening Eyesight].</p>
<p>The effect is just as it sounds.</p>
<p>I can worsen the eyesight of anyone I touch for three seconds, but it has no use.</p>
<p>I’d never use it in daily life. Let alone for esper battles.</p>
<p>I think it’s probably the weakest, compared to other esper powers.</p>
<p>I said it believing it’s the weakest.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Ms. Sakaki at the teacher’s podium was holding her stomach laughing.</p>
<p>What a teacher. Just quit. I thought, but kept silent.</p>
<p>…No, she’s a teacher. She must have already known my power from the start.</p>
<p>And despite that, making me do self-introductions first… She has a nasty personality.</p>
<p>The first time she showed a human-like smile to me, she asked,</p>
<p>“Pfft…hahahaha! W-What’s the effect of that ability, Amamori?”</p>
<p>“….It slightly blurs the vision for three seconds.”</p>
<p>What a nasty question.</p>
<p>I’m an idiot for answering it, but refusing here would just lead to expectations I couldn’t meet later. I should humble my power a little.</p>
<p>Well, my power is weak anyway.</p>
<p>And so, attempting the honest strategy to gain trust from my classmates –</p>
<p>“Pfft…Hahahahahahahaha! What the hell is that!?”</p>
<p>– it completely backfired.</p>

<p>Kirido’s raucous laughter roared, enveloping the classroom in laughter.</p>



<p>I looked around the classroom. Both the boys and girls were almost all laughing in unison.</p>



<p>From those guffawing loudly like Kirido, to those awkwardly laughing while trying not to, the breadth was wide, but they were all undoubtedly ‘laughing’.</p>



<p>Yeah. I expected this, but… still felt bad.</p>



<p>Calmly surveying the classroom, a few didn’t react at all – no, they had the complete opposite reaction.</p>



<p>And the one who stood out most distinctly was the girl sitting beside me.</p>



<p>Her closed eyelids opened, revealing transparent emerald green eyes.</p>



<p>Those eyes that seemed out of place on a Japanese showed strong anger, making me wonder what she planned to do, but before I knew it—</p>



<p>“What a nasty group of people this class is.”</p>



<p>A sharp, frigid voice rang out.</p>



<p>With a weight that seemed to pierce directly into one’s core, the sounds around us vanished.</p>



<p>Amidst the somehow cold stillness, that girl smoothly stood up.</p>



<p>“I have no intention to lecture. However, I scorn all who just laughed. Honesty is a virtue, not something to be ridiculed. That is my conviction, and I will not bend no matter what. That is all, just my impression.”</p>



<p>Those words were a blade of sharp, hostile tongue.</p>



<p>But this time, the one brandishing that blade was—overwhelming ‘beauty’.</p>



<p>The cold yet seemingly passionate beauty left everyone at a loss for words.</p>



<p>Clearly distinct from some pop idol or the like, she possessed absolute ‘beauty’. That passion and beauty further reinforced her argument.</p>



<p>“My name is Asahina Kasumi. My esper power is [Blessing of the Thunder God], able to summon, control, and completely dominate lightning. Incidentally, I’m also one of the four who avoided violating the school rules mentioned before.”</p>



<p>Shock rippled through the classroom at those words.</p>



<p>I was surprised too. Huh, isn’t that way too strong?</p>



<p>I kinda figured she’d be one of the ones who didn’t break the rules, but I absolutely didn’t think she had such a powerful esper ability.</p>



<p>Her gaze suddenly turned to me.</p>



<p>As I looked up at her in surprise, she flicked her long hair with her right hand and said just one thing.</p>



<p>“My dream is to be a ‘hero of justice’. To aid the weak and defeat evil. I intend to be that kind of hero! I look forward to the next three years with you, Amamori-kun!”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/53a8a0ab-14f5-4ca0-850f-9bd973b0d198_00009.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>And so she smirked at me.</p>



<p>A bizarre existence with icy coldness and youthful passion.</p>



<p>And probably among the top espers in our grade.</p>



<p>Meanwhile I’m… probably like roadside trash?</p>



<p>I don’t know what kind of future this encounter will lead to.</p>



<p>I don’t really understand, but anyway.</p>



<p>“…Ugh.”</p>



<p>I quietly muttered to myself in my mind, feeling like this was becoming a hassle.</p>



<p>☆☆☆</p>



<p>After that.</p>



<p>The mood wasn’t really right for continuing self-introductions (though we did all introduce ourselves), so carrying that atmosphere, we jumped right into our first class.</p>



<p>It was math class first period.</p>



<p>This school uses the same system as elementary schools, with the homeroom teacher teaching all subjects.</p>



<p>Right now Ms. Sakaki was explaining some difficult formulas.</p>



<p>The class content was far harder than a normal school. Flawlessly teaching material at this level, if Ms. Sakaki could do this for all subjects, she’d have to be way beyond just excellent as a teacher. There must be something to be able to teach at this paradise-like oppressor’s school.</p>



<p>I was staring at the blackboard, mechanical pencil in hand, but…</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>The stares stabbing into my back this whole time were getting a little annoying.</p>



<p>Basically some wanted to complain to me since they got reamed out by Asahina earlier, but didn’t have the guts to speak to her directly, so they’re taking it out on Amamori instead.</p>



<p>Well, there were only a few with ill feelings towards me.</p>



<p>Ignoring them, I turned my focus to the blackboard… However.</p>



<p>“……*glance*”</p>






<p>Now the sideward glances from my neighbor were annoying.</p>
<p>She’d been repeatedly glancing over as if to say ‘Is he keeping up with the lesson? Is he okay?’ really persistently. I sharply made eye contact, ‘Stop looking over here!’</p>
<p>Yet for some reason Asahina wasn’t looking this way now. Hey, look over here!</p>
<p>“Quite relaxed, aren’t you, Amamori.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>I looked up in surprise at the voice I heard from ahead to see Ms. Sakaki there with a cold smile.</p>
<p>But her eyes weren’t smiling at all.</p>
<p>“Zoning out in my class takes some nerve. Answer the question on P21, #3. Of course if you were properly listening to class you could answer it.”</p>
<p>At those words.</p>
<p>Weren’t we on P12 just now?</p>
<p>I kept that doubt to myself.</p>
<p>Flipping to page 21, I saw a notation for excerpts from past entrance exams for top universities and became dizzy.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Answering honestly, I sighed, expecting to be laughed at again.</p>
<p>But the ridicule from classmates never came, and looking beside me curiously—what do you know, the beautiful Asahina had raised her hand primly.</p>
<p>The boys sighed at the sight while the girls forgot their envy, entranced by her beauty.</p>
<p>And what are you doing, idiot?</p>
<p>I tilted my head inside while the aforementioned Asahina opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“The answer is ‘ + ‘, right?”</p>
<p>“….Correct, but why are you answering, Asahina?”</p>
<p>“Supporting a classmate in need is natural, no?</p>
<p>She returned Ms. Sakaki’s sharp words with her own.</p>
<p>Turning her gaze to me, she gave a cute smile.</p>
<p>“No good, Amamori-kun. You have to properly pay attention in class.”</p>
<p>…Come on, who do you think caused this!? I’ll kill you!</p>
<p>I thought that, but kept it hidden and gave a small polite bow to smooth it over.</p>
<p>Watching our exchange, Ms. Sakaki heaved a big sigh.</p>
<p>And at that timely moment, the chime signaling the end of class echoed.</p>
<p>“Well, fine. Be more attentive from next time onward. This concludes the first period. Next is PE. Everyone go change into gym clothes in the locker room and gather on the field.”</p>
<p>And so, the class ended without any greetings.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but mutter quietly to myself, feeling that things were getting bothersome.</p>
<p>It seemed like I had caught the attention of the teacher on the very first day, and my classmates didn’t seem to like me.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh for various reasons, but I quickly changed my mindset and started moving with the jersey I had been given earlier.</p>
<p>The reason was straightforward:</p>
<p>“The ninth rule: Be on time for class. Those who are not prepared for class when the bell rings for the start of class will, in principle, be subject to a fine of 100,000 yen or expulsion, whichever is deemed appropriate.” …That’s why I had to move.</p>
<p>Well, what’s written seems reasonable as a rule, but honestly, the fine amount is insane. A fine of 100,000 yen? That can buy two game consoles.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I was the first to start moving.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to linger too long and get caught up with Asahina san or other students.</p>
<p>But as I acted on this thought…</p>
<p>“Hey, hold on a second!”</p>
<p>Somehow, a line straight out of a manga like “Kim○k” was thrown at me.</p>
<p>When I turned around, there was a student who had been called “Kirido” standing there.</p>
<p>He clearly had dyed hair and artificial curls, as if to say, “I’ve got style.” He had gray eyes, probably from wearing colored contacts. Honestly, it didn’t suit him at all. He was trying to look cool, wearing his uniform loosely and acting like the leader of the class, but he wasn’t exactly handsome, so I honestly thought he looked lame.</p>
<p>In conclusion, he should apologize to Kim○k.</p>
<p>“Hey, did you say your name was Amamori? You seem to have stumbled upon a pretty weak ability! As for me, I have ‘Instant Acceleration,’ the strongest ability when it comes to speed. No one can beat me!”</p>
<p>I looked at the guy next to me in silence. …I looked back at him, understanding what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>“…That’s fortunate for you. So, what do you want?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s with that cheeky attitude? If I go all out, it’ll be over in an instant, you know?”</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen in an instant. I was a little curious, but well, I understood what he was getting at.</p>
<p>This Kirido guy had been increasingly focusing his attention on Asahina san since earlier. He probably wanted to show off his good side to the class’s pretty girl.</p>
<p>Well, I think it’s counterproductive when it comes to Asahina san.</p>
<p>She stood up from her seat and came over to me.</p>
<p>“…Yuuto Amamori. The next class is physical education. Shall we go together?”</p>
<p>Her lifeline to rescue me. Should I continue to deal with Kirido or move with Asahina san?</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t like either option, but if I had to choose one, it would probably be the latter.</p>
<p>I adjusted the bag containing my gym clothes and started walking with her.</p>
<p>“Oh, hold on, the conversation isn’t over yet!”</p>
<p>I heard Kirido’s voice from behind, but Asahina san ignored him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it, Yuuto-kun. You haven’t done anything wrong.”</p>
<p>I didn’t need to be told that.</p>
<p>I hadn’t paid much attention to such a small fry from the beginning.</p>

<p>Five minutes before the start of the class.</p>
<p>After that, I went straight to the changing room and quickly changed into my gym clothes. Then, I killed some time before heading to the designated meeting place, the school grounds.</p>
<p>All my classmates, except me, were already gathered there, and they were surrounding one student, creating a bit of a festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey! Where are you from, Asahina san?”</p>
<p>“Asahina san’s words, you know, they sort of struck a chord with me!”</p>
<p>“Also, ‘Thunder God’s Blessing,’ even the name sounds powerful!”</p>
<p>“You control lightning, right? It kind of feels like you’re cheating! I’m so jealous!”</p>
<p>Yes, the person they were surrounding was the same Asahina san.</p>
<p>She was glancing around at the female students surrounding her with a troubled expression (there was also one male student named Kirido mixed in there, by the way), and then she responded with a slightly troubled expression.</p>
<p>“…I just told the truth. Besides, even obtaining this ability was just a matter of luck. It happened to be my lucky day, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“But still, it feels like it’s fate because it’s you, Asahina san!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, it’s because it’s Asahina san, so it feels inevitable!”</p>
<p>They were saying some pretty random stuff, but when I saw Asahina san chatting with her classmates like this, I felt a little relieved. I was worried that I might be isolated even further due to my connection with her.</p>
<p>Well, now, if Asahina san stops bothering with me, there won’t be any complaints.</p>
<p>What should I do… I pondered by myself.</p>
<p>“Hey, you there! You’re Amamori, right? You’re unlucky too!”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I turned my gaze to the person next to me, and there was a guy who looked somewhat similar to Kirido.</p>
<p>“Karasuma Tohji.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you remembered my name? I’m impressed,” he said with a snicker. With his bleached, permed hair and appearance that ten out of ten would call ‘delinquent’, talking to him I got the sense he didn’t have the same malice as Kirido.</p>
<p>He put his arm around my shoulder and lowered his voice so no one else could hear.</p>
<p>“It’s Kirido, right? That guy who’s already getting full of himself in class. He and I are from nearby hometowns, so I’ve heard various bad rumors about him.”</p>
<p>“Bad rumors…?”</p>
<p>He nodded at my words and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>What he told me were really unpleasant rumors surrounding the guy called Kirido.</p>
<p>Supposedly he put a whole bunch of adults in the hospital in a brawl.</p>
<p>Supposedly he constantly had issues with women.</p>
<p>Supposedly he used to go to a boxing gym so his physical abilities are top notch.</p>
<p>Supposedly he’s selfish and short-tempered. A water balloon that’ll burst if you poke it even a little.</p>
<p>As Karasuma said “There’s more” with excitement, my head started to hurt.</p>
<p>“And now that kinda guy’s got esper powers and can do whatever he wants… Plus, Amamori, I’ve got a hunch his current target is you.”</p>
<p>“Why’s that?”</p>
<p>I asked, but could guess the gist of it.</p>
<p>Just as Karasuma was about to answer, at the worst timing, Ms. Sakaki appeared on the field. Seeing her, Karasuma reluctantly closed his mouth.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you the rest later.”</p>
<p>Saying that, he ran over to our classmates.</p>
<p>Watching his back, I felt like my eyes briefly met Ms. Sakaki’s. But she just smiled thinly without approaching me.</p>
<p>“Now then, it looks like everyone has gathered.”</p>
<p>The moment her voice rang out, the starting chime echoed.</p>
<p>I also started walking over to where the students were gathered, and… does she have radar or something? Asahina, who’d just turned this way, waved at me.</p>
<p>It was awfully cute, but I wish she wouldn’t since it got me bad stares from the other students. I pretended not to notice and joined the line, at the same time Ms. Sakaki opened her mouth. However—</p>
<p>“Now I’ll explain—”</p>
<p>“Yo, hold up, Sakaki!”</p>
<p>Someone cut her off mid-sentence.</p>
<p>I looked in the direction of the voice to see Kirido there glaring angrily at me, leaving everyone present at a loss.</p>
<p>Ms. Sakaki and I were no exceptions.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to pull, Kirido?”</p>
<p>“Hah? I ain’t pulling nothing. I heard it from an upperclassman who came to recruit me for a club yesterday. PE classes in this school are basically combat training with esper abilities, right? And for the first class, students are made to do mock battles.”</p>





<p>…Oh. So he was wary of PE classes and used the most efficient method of asking upperclassmen to get information, huh. I was honestly surprised.</p>
<p>“That’s right. What’s valued in this academy alongside academics and club activities is none other than ‘esper force’ itself. Thus the goal of PE classes is to enhance your esper abilities and depending on the circumstances, also focus on improving your physical abilities. And for the first class, two randomly selected students will be made to battle.”</p>
<p>Hearing Ms. Sakaki’s words, a hideous smile floated onto Kirido’s face.</p>
<p>“Then let me and that guy fight, Sakaki!”</p>
<p>The one Kirido pointed at was… me, of course.</p>
<p>It made me doubt my own sanity. Did something in his head boil over?</p>
<p>The students around us were confused, and the class rep Kurashiki spoke up.</p>
<p>“W-Wait, Kirido-kun!? Why Amamori-kun—”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious ain’t it!? He ignored Asahina earlier!”</p>
<p>At his retort, I grimaced….Glancing timidly at the person herself, Asahina looked puzzled as she tilted her head.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? if you mean when I waved at him earlier, it was simply that he didn’t notice, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah…? That’s how it looked…”</p>
<p>Voices agreeing with Asahina’s words could be heard.</p>
<p>Even with my lies and acting skills. Seeing our classmates’ reactions, it didn’t seem my ‘pretending not to notice’ act had been exposed.</p>
<p>If so, why was Kirido saying such things…?</p>
<p>“—I see, that’s why.”</p>
<p>Looking at him, Kirido’s face was twisted in delight, so loathsome I nearly threw up.</p>
<p>“That attitude pisses me off! Weak yet ignoring Asahina’s greeting, scum like you don’t deserve to get noticed by her!”</p>
<p>This was probably ‘jealousy’ and ‘pride’.</p>
<p>Seeing a weakling like me being spoken to by the class beauty, ‘Asahina Kasumi’, made him angry.</p>
<p>So he wanted to stop that. To beat down the trash and show off his strength.</p>
<p>To stomp on the weak and stand tall.</p>
<p>To prove he was the one suited to be by Asahina Kasumi’s side—or something like that? Does that sound about right?</p>
<p>“W-Wait a minute, Kirido-kun! I acted of my own—”</p>
<p>“I know, Asahina! It’s because of trash like him you waste your time being nice! If he’s gone, it solves everything! That’s all there is to it!”</p>
<p>I half agreed, but the other half just wanted to vomit.</p>
<p>He was totally planning to attack me. Please stop. With all that confidence, his [Instant Acceleration] ability is probably pretty strong too.</p>
<p>If so, I’d just get one-sidedly beaten up.</p>
<p>“What will you do, Amamori? The choice to accept or not is up to you.”</p>
<p>I heard Ms. Sakaki’s quiet voice.</p>
<p>As for her, she looked at Kirido as if at garbage.</p>
<p>Well… Doesn’t seem there’s any benefit for me to fight right now, but—</p>
<p>“You running away, trash!? No guts to fight, weak esper power, a coward who runs at the first sign of danger… I wanna see your face when your family sees you like this!”</p>
<p>“Kirido-kun, that’s going too far!”</p>
<p>Asahina angrily yelled at Kirido, but… he did have a foul mouth. It was starting to grate on my ears a little.</p>
<p>I scratched my head with my right hand and looked at Ms. Sakaki.</p>
<p>“Hey, can we consider this already started?”</p>
<p>“Hm?… Oh, I see. Do as you like.”</p>
<p>Understanding my true intentions, he grinned and spoke.</p>
<p>Amidst Asahina, Kirido, the classmates, and everyone else dumbfounded by my words—</p>
<p>I dashed straight ahead in one breath.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The idiot face right before me.</p>
<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I’ll repay malice with tremendous malice.</p>
<p>Sorry, Kirido. This is the only way I know how to do things.</p>
<p>“Blugh!?”</p>
<p>A surprise straight right to Kirido’s face.</p>
<p>Fresh blood sprayed everywhere as screams erupted from the class.</p>
<p>Blown back a bit, Kirido writhed in intense pain, and I looked down at him.</p>
<p>“Well, if you insist that much Kirido, guess we’ll fight.”</p>
<p>With the students around us dumbfounded and Ms. Sakaki laughing loudly—</p>
<p>“Y-You…!”</p>
<p>Eventually, Kirido got up in anger.</p>
<p>His eyes glared at me murderously, and his gaze made my knees shake.</p>
<p>Oh crap. What dangerous guy did I pick a fight with? I wanna go back in time and punch myself. So could you let this slide?</p>
<p>Now I recalled those ‘nasty rumors’ about him, and Kirido shouted in frustration.</p>
<p>“That nonchalant face pisses me off! However I glare or threaten you, you don’t lose your composure, that attitude!”</p>
<p>Nonchalant? No, I don’t have anything like that. Could he have misunderstood since my expressions don’t show on my face much? Sorry about that, Kirido.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m properly terrified.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p>Enraged by my 100% good-faith words, he lost it. How strange.</p>
<p>Filled with anger, he took on a bizarre forward-leaning posture.</p>
<p>It was the complete opposite of how a normal person should position themselves for combat. Full of openings yet unable to counterattack on the spur of the moment. It went entirely against common combat tactics—an attacking-focused form concentrating solely on charging ahead.</p>
<p>Maybe like the crouching start in track and field?</p>
<p>Normally I’d laugh, but there were ‘esper abilities’ in this school.</p>
<p>I heightened my vigilance, but in the next instant, a fist neared my face.</p>
<p>“Wha—!?”</p>
<p>Esper ability [Instant Acceleration]</p>
<p>As the name suggests, his power was probably temporarily accelerating a target object.</p>
<p>Kirido used it on his own body. Thus what took form was a human body launched at superhuman speeds and a vicious fist. That speed… With a complete surprise attack, any spur-of-the-moment reaction was—impossible.</p>
<p>A powerful blow slammed into my face.</p>
<p>The impact and acute pain. The bridge of my nose stung sharply. The taste of crimson blood spread in my mouth, and while reeling back, I clutched my face. Ow, nosebleed.</p>
<p>“One hit! It’s just getting started, this is the beginning!”</p>
<p>Contrasting my dampened mood, Kirido’s excitement was through the roof.</p>
<p>I put up a guard with both arms on my face. Seeing that, Kirido sneered and accelerated his body again—then in the next instant, his fist was buried in my stomach.</p>
<p>“Gah…!?”</p>
<p>Accelerating his body itself and accelerating his fist on impact.</p>
<p>The tremendous power folded my body like a straw.</p>
<p>“All bark and no bite after that first sucker punch, weakling! Now eat this!”</p>
<p>My guard loosened from the impact, and a fist slammed down on my head.</p>
<p>My brain rattled and my vision blurred.</p>
<p>Blood from the cut on my forehead flooded the entire right half of my vision.</p>
<p>Did blood get in my right eye…? Gonna be a pain washing it out later.</p>
<p>“Raaa!”</p>
<p>Kirido’s body accelerated again, and when I realized it, I was rolling on the ground.</p>
<p>A sweep or did he knock me down with a punch?</p>
<p>Kirido climbed on me as I collapsed and looked down at me with a filthy grin.</p>
<p>“Kehaha! What happened to all that energy!? The fun’s just getting started! Hey, stand up! Stand up if you can, bastard!”</p>
<p>Punches rained down, knocking me around. I desperately put up a guard with my face, but he forcefully pried it open and fists came crashing down on my defenseless face.</p>
<p>Each time, blood sprayed and the intense pain contorted my face.</p>
<p>“S-Stop already, Kirido-kun! You’re going overboard!”</p>
<p>“Shut it! This piece of crap got on my nerves!”</p>
<p>Amidst it all, I could hear the class rep Kurashiki’s voice from somewhere.</p>
<p>I looked up to see Kirido was getting full of himself. Getting a bit pissed off, when I caught his fist, I resolutely headbutted his face with all my strength.</p>
<p>“Oww, damn that hurts!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, my hand slipped.”</p>
<p>He stumbled back off me from the pain. I apologized since he seemed to be hurting so bad, but that just deepened the anger in his gaze.</p>
<p>I shakily stood up, and Kirido also got back on his feet.</p>
<p>With me clearly at my limit, and Kirido brimming with anger and energy.</p>
<p>Hmm, this much difference just from using an esper power or not…?</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you, kill you dead! You’re going straight to hell!”</p>
<p>Spitting those words, Kirido shouted.</p>
<p>I put up my guard… or rather, reinforced it, and Kirido accelerated again.</p>
<p>Now at the peak acceleration so far today. My eyes couldn’t even follow the afterimages anymore.</p>
<p>Experiencing it firsthand, this was an esper power…</p>
<p>In the next instant—</p>
<p>A flash of lightning tore past beside me.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, Kirido-kun.”</p>
<p>Long black hair fluttering in the wind and a cold, dignified voice.</p>
<p>Eyes wide, both Kirido and I—and everyone present—were stunned by the literally ‘otherworldly’ speed.</p>
<p>The girl easily caught his blood-stained fist in one hand and shot Kirido a sharp look.</p>
<p>“This is a mock battle… Since Amamori-kun agreed, I intended to respect his will to a certain extent. However, any more would be going overboard by my judgment.”</p>
<p>“What the hell you sayin’! I ain’t gonna stop cause of you, Asahina!”</p>
<p>“Oh? So I should have not stopped you?”</p>
<p>Saying that, she glared at Kirido and took out her student handbook.</p>
<p>…That’s right. Surely text like this would be displayed on the screen:</p>
<p>‘Article 2. Attacks made with killing intent are prohibited. Students violating this will be expelled.’</p>
<p>Seeing that screen, Kirido’s face turned pale blue.</p>
<p>He looked to Ms. Sakaki in a panic. Seeing his expression, Ms. Sakaki opened her mouth in exasperation.</p>
<p>“It was the optimal timing to step in, Asahina. If he had kept repeatedly attacking and saying ‘I’ll kill you’, Kirido—I would have judged it as violating Article 2 and expelled you.”</p>
<p>“W-Wait, for real…!?”</p>
<p>Even he quieted down at the word ‘expulsion’.</p>
<p>Kirido muttered “Damn it” as he lowered his fist, and Asahina sighed. The tension left me and I slumped down, only to be supported by Ms. Sakaki who happened to be nearby… At that time, she whispered in my ear.</p>





<p>“Don’t bully him too much. We were just about to have an expulsion on the first day, Amamori Yuuto.”</p>
<p>It was a small voice, quiet enough that no one else could hear.</p>
<p>What is she saying? I was the one being bullied here, wasn’t I?</p>
<p>It’s not like I provoked him to drag out the word ‘kill’ so I could conveniently eliminate him.</p>
<p>No matter how annoying, he’s my precious classmate!</p>
<p>“That’s heartless. I’ve never framed anyone in my life.”</p>
<p>“The line ‘never once in my life’ is a habitual phrase of liars.”</p>
<p>Oh, is that so? A liar’s habitual phrase, huh.</p>
<p>When I’ve never lied even once in my life.</p>
<p>“Well, whatever. Amamori, you go to the nurse’s office. You can rest there today. I certainly can’t tell you to attend class with those injuries.”</p>
<p>Covered in wounds all over, I honestly could barely stand.</p>
<p>Normally I’d go straight to the hospital, but this was the nurse’s office of the esper-powered Senei Academy . It’d likely have greater healing effects than some hospital.</p>
<p>“T-Then I’ll take Amamori-kun to the nurse’s office!</p>
<p>The ponytailed Kurashiki raised her hand nervously.</p>
<p>It took some real courage. Most girls wouldn’t even consider accompanying a bloodied male classmate. As expected of the class rep.</p>
<p>“Kurashiki… Fine, I’ll allow it. Hurry up and take him.”</p>
<p>After briefly thinking, Ms. Sakaki replied as such. Kurashiki-san ran over to my side.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Amamori-kun!”</p>
<p>Lively, yet with a gaze full of concern for me.</p>
<p>She made quite the skillful expression, but I simply nodded.</p>
<p>“Ah, please be gentle with me.”</p>
<p>And so I finished my first day of school life.</p>
<p>Kurashiki and I started walking, and from behind, I could feel Asahina and Kirido’s gazes carrying completely different meanings, but figuring that out seemed annoying so I left it for later.</p>
<p>I was tired, in pain… fed up with it all. I also wanted to sleep already, so I hurried to the nurse’s office with Kurashiki.</p>
<p>☆☆☆</p>
<p>“ow……”</p>
<p>I winced in pain and pressed an ice pack to my face.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Kurashiki and I went to the nurse’s office where I received various treatments from the nurse, and I was currently lying in bed undergoing them.</p>
<p>Looking beside me, Kurashiki watched me worriedly.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Amamori-kun…?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll manage. Thank you, Kurashiki-san.”</p>
<p>As I expected, or rather, with it being a school made with the finest technology gathered, there were a ton of medicine I’d never seen in stock, and after the nurse injected some of them (do school nurses do that?), the pain lessened and my injuries were healing quite a bit.</p>
<p>“Geez, some people do awful stuff. How many times were you punched, huh?”</p>
<p>“I lost count,”</p>
<p>I replied to the nurse. Though the medicine had improved the swelling, my face was still swollen. The only silver lining about being punched so much was that there was absolutely no impact to my bones.</p>
<p>“Things suddenly turned bad… Sorry about that. I really should have stopped it sooner.”</p>
<p>Kurashiki-san said that apologetically.</p>
<p>…No, I can’t ask something so unreasonable. A high school girl stepping into a brawl between boys… What kind of monster would do that?</p>
<p>Though Asahina wasn’t even a girl to begin with considering her actions… By the way, [Blessing of the Thunder God] sure was fast. It easily beat Kirido’s ‘self-proclaimed fastest’.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it…. Though I do prefer peace and quiet not being disrupted.”</p>
<p>I originally liked ordinary, peaceful times.</p>
<p>Lazing around in tranquil peace put me in an inexplicably happy mood.</p>
<p>That’s why I regretted coming to this school immediately. It’d normally be an automatic fine for not attending class, though I was off the hook for now thanks to Ms. Sakaki’s ‘permission’.</p>

<p>I turned my gaze to the wall clock.</p>



<p>Kurashiki and I were already disregarding the starting school bell, and were out of class in the first place, so we were probably violating other school rules too.</p>



<p>But all of that was invalidated by the teacher’s single word of ‘permission’.</p>



<p>It implied that the ‘teacher’s words took priority over the school rules’, proving the ‘teachers are absolute’ stated in the student handbook.</p>



<p>In other words, if a teacher said ‘fine’, it was a fine. And if they said ‘expel’, it meant expulsion.</p>



<p>“Things might get troublesome, Amamori-kun.”</p>



<p>I slowly turned to the voice echoing in the nurse’s office.</p>



<p>It was Kurashiki, who like me had been gazing at the wall clock.</p>



<p>Seeing her figure and words, I grew a little suspicious.</p>



<p>…Was this class rep the type to say things like that?</p>



<p>“Um, Kurashiki…-san.”</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry about that. It was out of context, right?”</p>



<p>When she looked at me, she had already reverted to the class rep I knew.</p>



<p>The bright orange, nearly reddish hair in a ponytail.</p>



<p>Her round eyes directly met mine.</p>



<p>The little snaggletooth peeking out from her mouth accentuated her liveliness, but—her expression was suddenly cast in shadow.</p>



<p>“I think Kirido-kun likes Asahina-san… so things will probably get troublesome from here on.”</p>



<p>…Oh, troublesome in that sense. You surprised me.</p>



<p>“Well… I’ll manage somehow. Besides, it’s nothing Kurashiki-san needs to worry about.”</p>



<p>To be honest, I understood how Kirido felt to some extent.</p>



<p>A girl you like is interested in another guy, so you get jealous and dislike him.</p>



<p>Those feelings themselves were quite age-appropriate… natural for a high school first-year boy. Though punching someone for it was crazy.</p>



<p>I muttered internally and turned my gaze back to the clock.</p>



<p>Quite some time had passed since the next class started. Staying in the nurse’s office indefinitely made me antsy too… To be blunt, I was tired and wanted to sleep. Shouldn’t she go back soon?</p>



<p>Thinking that, I was about to say something to her—in the next moment.</p>



<p>“So I guess you won’t let yourself get punched on purpose now?”</p>



<p>I froze a little at those words.</p>



<p>My evaluation of the girl before me did a 180 from ‘just the class rep’</p>







<p>“Amamori-kun, you’re actually way stronger than Kirido-kun, right?”</p>



<p>The girl looking down at me still had a cute smile.</p>



<p>Kurashiki… her given name was Hotaru, I think?</p>



<p>During self-introductions, she’d said her power was ‘a slight enhancement to physical abilities’.</p>



<p>Certainly not strong… it was an ability belonging to the weak category.</p>



<p>Could she have seen through that battle with just her level of physical enhancement?</p>



<p>“Haah. Did you lose your mind? You think I intentionally got punched?”</p>



<p>“Eh, but Amamori-kun, you were watching all of Kirido-kun’s movements with your eyes, right?”</p>



<p>Further re-evaluation.</p>



<p>I see. So this girl wasn’t the class rep—she was just an idiot.</p>



<p>I intentionally let myself get punched…? She could make whatever baseless assumptions she wanted, but stating hypotheses without basis wasn’t praiseworthy. Her ‘memory’ that I was watching his movements was surely fabricated from her desire to ‘believe that’.</p>



<p>“Kurashiki-san. You’re free to dream, but… don’t be tactless. I’m injured here.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah… Sorry, Amamori-kun.”</p>



<p>She said, putting her hands together.</p>



<p>Whether it was bluffing or delusions, I didn’t like her overestimating my strength baselessly.</p>



<p>It’s best to quickly get rid of these insufferable types forcing their warped goodwill.</p>



<p>I swiftly operated my smartphone and shoved the text from the rules in her face.</p>



<p>” ‘Article 10. Leaving the classroom during lessons is prohibited in principle. Those who leave the classroom of their own accord without any permission will receive either a ¥100,000 fine, expulsion, or other measures.’ … It’s best not to overstay even with Ms. Sakaki’s permission.”</p>



<p>Clearly, our current situation didn’t fall under this article. But there was still so much I didn’t know about this school. Once your business is done, it’s better to return to class early, that’s what I think.</p>



<p>However, she just smiled and scratched her cheek at my warning.</p>



<p>“I know you’re worried about me, and I appreciate it. But don’t worry, it’s fine! I’ll just use the excuse I went to the bathroom~ There’s no way a teacher would tell a girl to hold it in during class, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s… true, I guess?”</p>



<p>I hate to say it, but Ms. Sakaki is missing a few screws.</p>



<p>I vaguely felt that she wasn’t living seriously in the present.</p>



<p>I didn’t think someone like her would say to a female student, ‘The bathroom? Is that or class more important? If you say the bathroom, feel free to go as you like. Though of course, that would mean a rule violation’… Yeah, she seemed like she’d say it expressionlessly.</p>



<p>We’d only met a few hours ago, but she seemed like she could say it without even changing her expression.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it better you go back seriously? It’s Ms. Sakaki we’re talking about.”</p>



<p>“Mm… That’s true, when you say it that way it does make me uneasy, but for me, I’m more worried about Amamori-kun than a one-time fine. Don’t mind me!”</p>



<p>She gently smiled with such a wonderful line.</p>



<p>Wow, wasn’t that wicked just now? Most would be totally fooled.</p>



<p>I lightly imagined getting carried away by the misunderstanding, confessing, and getting rejected.</p>



<p>…But too bad. You should aim that misleading behavior at guys other than me.</p>



<p>No matter what you say to me, my evaluation of you won’t change.</p>



<p>I heaved a sigh and turned my gaze away from her.</p>



<p>“Hmm, so I don’t interest you that way, huh Amamori-kun.”</p>



<p>“It’s not particularly that. I’ll apologize if I hurt your feelings.”</p>



<p>I’m interested in this girl to a normal degree.</p>



<p>Good looks rivaling Asahina’s in class. Kind and spirited to everyone.</p>



<p>No wonder she was popular. I paid more attention to this girl than Asahina and the like, incomparably so… However, Kurashiki Hotaru-san.</p>



<p>My attention to you isn’t as a member of the opposite sex—it’s caution towards you as an object of vigilance.</p>



<p>“But really, I’m fine. It’ll weigh on my conscience if you get fined because of me. Please protect my reputation here.”</p>



<p>“Hmm—that phrasing feels sneaky!”</p>



<p>I know. That’s why I said it, fully aware of the sneakiness.</p>



<p>She stood up discontentedly, and at that timely moment the chime for the end of class echoed.</p>



<p>“Guess I should head back soon like Amamori-kun told me!”</p>



<p>She started walking with the chime as her BGM, but stopped right before opening the door and turned back to look at me.</p>



<p>With a cute “Here~” she tossed over a folded memo sheet.</p>



<p>“What’s this?”</p>



<p>I caught the memo sheet that fell on my chest and asked.</p>



<p>She winked cutely, a finger on her lips as she smiled.</p>



<p>“It’s my phone number and email! Lots of people know my LAIN account, but you’re the first one I’ve given my number to in this school, so be sure to add me properly! I’ll be waiting for you to contact me!”</p>



<p>Saying that, she pitter-pattered out of the nurse’s office in her indoor shoes. As the sounds of her footsteps faded into the distance beyond the wide open door, I heaved a sigh.</p>
