<h1>Chapter 1: My Classmate Is an Idol, but Is It Okay to Support Her?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>I have a channel called ‘Kei’s Game Commentary’ and it’s about time for my usual upload.</p>



<p>“All right, done.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I muttered while looking at my smartphone, nodding in satisfaction.</p>



<p>I had scheduled the video I created last night to be released this morning, and it seems to have been uploaded successfully.</p>



<p>With that settled, I was planning to spend the remaining time before class on looking up the latest gaming news.</p>



<p>But then—</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s Yuki!” (Student)</p>



<p>“Good morning, Yuki!” (Student)</p>



<p>“Ah, Yuki is in school today. Is today a lucky day?” (Student)</p>



<p>“As expected, Yuki is cute…” (Student)</p>



<p>The classroom suddenly became noisy. I lifted my head at the mention of the word ‘Yuki’ and looked towards the entrance.</p>



<p>“……!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>In an instant, I was fixated on the figure of the girl who just entered.</p>



<p>Glossy long black hair. A well-proportioned body with prominent features, and slender limbs extending from it. Flawlessly structured facial features, accompanied by a slightly cool smile. Above all, a special aura emanated from her entire being, creating an atmosphere completely different from an ordinary person’s.</p>



<p>She’s Nozomi Yukina, also commonly known as Yuki.</p>



<p>A member of the top idol group ‘Angel’, which is also known as ‘@ngeL25,’ and the leader of the popular ‘Five Archangels’, which consists of the top five members of the group.</p>



<p>She possessed outstanding talent in singing, and her dancing was equally incredible. Her live performance at Nippon Budokan the other day had become somewhat legendary, and her performance was truly breathtaking.</p>



<p>Even though she’s a genius with a more artistic side in the form of being an idol, she occasionally shows a slightly airheaded personality on talk shows, creating a cute contrast. Lately, she’s been appearing in solo commercials all over the place, truly embodying the image of a dazzling idol.</p>



<p>…And, she’s also my—Amamiya Keitaro’s—number one oshi.</p>



<p>Now, why did such an amazing person appear in this classroom? Well, the answer is simple: she’s my classmate.</p>



<p>…Well, it’s a bit late to realize this, but isn’t it seriously amazing that Yuki is in the same class as me?</p>



<p>Apparently, our school accepts celebrities, and that seems to be the case here. However, I only found out about it after enrolling.</p>



<p>I chose this school simply because it was close to home and had a good academic reputation. However, I only got to know Yuki after hearing rumors that there was an idol in the same year.</p>



<p>At first, it was just a passing thought. One day, I just casually remembered, “Come to think of it, is there an idol in the same grade?” And when I looked more into it, that marked the beginning of everything.</p>



<p>I’ve always been an otaku, but until then, I had no interest in the so-called 3D world of idols. My thought process used to be more like, “Idols? I don’t really care about 3D stuff, but well, why not?” But the moment I watched a video of Yuki singing, I vividly remember being struck by a shock as if lightning had hit me.</p>



<p>Her voice, clear yet deeply resonating, pierced through me.</p>



<p>On stage, Yuki shines like an angel.</p>



<p>Everything from start to finish was shocking, and from that point on, I found myself eagerly listening to [Angel]’s songs. Shortly thereafter, I had an experience that literally changed my world when I heard the song “BELIEVE”, which marked Yuki’s debut as the main vocalist.</p>



<p>Around that time, I had just started my game commentary journey and was facing various challenges, on the verge of giving up. However, hearing “BELIEVE” helped me regain my composure, and to this day, I’ve been able to continue my activities, steadily doing my best to become a top content creator. In other words, Yuki is not only my oshi but also a great benefactor. …Phew, is there anyone who wouldn’t get hooked after encountering such an angel?</p>



<p>Of course, I got hooked. I got hooked big time.</p>



<p>I purchased all of [Angel]’s songs, utilized resale apps for bonuses and merchandise, and attended every live performance within the limits of a high school student. Thus, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that my entire first year of high school was dedicated to gaming commentary and supporting Yuki.</p>



<p>And this spring, when I moved up to the second year, I found myself in the same class as Yuki, and naturally, I hit my limit. You know how people feel so happy that they hug their pillows and start to moan and roll on their beds? I can confirm that this kind of thing exists from personal experience. By the way, my sister witnessed that scene perfectly, and I still vividly remember the icy glare she gave me. If anyone knows a way to selectively erase memories, please let me know.</p>



<p>“Good morning.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>In response to the classmate’s greeting, Yuki, with few words but a faint smile, returned the greeting. I gazed at her almost in a dreamlike state.</p>



<p><em>…Haa</em>, she’s so cool and cute again today. Truly an angel. Just seeing that smile is healing…</p>



<p>As someone said earlier, today is indeed a lucky day.</p>



<p>Yuki, being the highly popular idol that she is, is usually busy with work, and her school attendance is irregular. That’s why the days when I get to see Yuki at school are considered exceptionally lucky.</p>



<p id="no1">To not miss out on those days, I’ve become more mindful of my health. Not only does her singing voice heal my heart, but it also improves my quality of life… Yeah, Yuki is definitely a goddess. <a href="#footnote">QED<sup>1</sup></a>. Proof complete.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Yukina-san.” (Student)</p>



<p>“Y-Yuki, good morning…” (Student)</p>



<p>“Ah, um, good morning!” (Student)</p>



<p>Lost in such thoughts, Yuki passed by my desk on her way to her seat.</p>



<p>While the classmates around me eagerly greeted Yuki, I didn’t utter a single word.</p>



<p>In fact, the moment Yuki approached, I quickly averted my gaze.</p>



<p>Hey, wasn’t she your oshi? Don’t you want to interact with her? Some might wonder. Well, that’s exactly right.</p>



<p>Because Yuki is my oshi, that’s precisely why I don’t want to get involved with her.</p>



<p>You often hear people say things like, “I want my oshi to notice me” or “I want to get closer to my oshi”, but I don’t share those sentiments. In fact, I think those who say such things aren’t true fans.</p>



<p>…You get it, right? Your oshi is like an existence from another dimension.</p>



<p>You watch from afar, appreciate their existence, and gain the strength to live from their preciousness… that’s right, it’s like the sun!</p>



<p id="no2">If you try to approach the sun—something you shouldn’t naturally get close to—it will only result in burning up like <a href="#footnote">Icarus<sup>2</sup></a>. It’s troublesome for both sides if you get too close. It’s unthinkable to cause any inconvenience to your oshi.</p>



<p>This is my belief. It’s okay to cheer for her behind the screen, but directly approaching or striking up a conversation is a big no-no. Making acquaintanceships or anything like that is absolutely out of the question.</p>



<p>Thanks to this conviction, I don’t even greet Yuki, and since we became classmates, we’ve never exchanged words. I don’t think our eyes have ever met.</p>



<p>To support your oshi without them being aware of your existence. That, in essence, is the way a true fan should be.</p>



<p>…Ah, by the way, please spare me from the rational arguments like, “In the first place, someone like you can’t become acquainted with Yuki”, or anything along those lines. Just because it’s a fact doesn’t mean you should blurt everything out. That’s something they should teach as compulsory education.</p>



<p>Sure, I might just be Yuki’s classmate, and my grades, athletic abilities, and looks are nothing special… Plus, I tend to be a bit of a loner in the class, and it’s not entirely wrong to say I’m at the very bottom of the school caste hierarchy…</p>



<p id="no3">Nevertheless, I do have a bit of confidence in my gaming skills, and I’m a determined individual striving to climb the ranks in the world of game commentary. I’m diligently doing game commentary on <a href="#footnote">YouTube<sup>3</sup></a> every day, aiming for the top.</p>



<p>…So, now you might be wondering about my view counts and number of subscribers.</p>



<p>They are mostly single-digit, and even during live streams, the concurrent viewership rarely goes beyond the count of fingers on one hand. But hey, it’s fine for now! There’s still room to grow in the future!</p>



<p>Besides, doing gaming commentary is fun in itself, and even on the channel of such a bottom-tier YouTuber, there are people who always leave comments.</p>



<p>I take out my phone again and try to check my past archives. But at that moment, when I casually checked the latest video I just uploaded,</p>



<p>“…Eh, comments already? That was fast!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Surprisingly, there were already comments, and I couldn’t help but be amazed.</p>



<p>The commenter’s name was ‘Wankoromochi.’</p>



<p>This viewer would always leave comments on my videos and tune in to my live streams. In other words, they are a regular supporter.</p>



<p>Still, I never expected to receive comments this quickly…! I’m seriously thrilled. It warms my heart…!</p>



<p>Feeling a warm sensation in my chest, I express gratitude to Wankoromochi.  It’s because of people like them that I can stay motivated on my channel… I’m truly thankful.</p>



<p>Even though it’s just one person, having a dedicated viewer like this who consistently watches is great. Plus, being in the same class as my oshi, all things considered, I’m quite fortunate.</p>



<p>With these thoughts in mind, I lift my gaze from my smartphone and glance at Yuki, who is sitting at her desk and chatting with her female friends.</p>



<p>Yuki doesn’t give off the typical impression of being ‘friendly’ or ‘sociable’. If anything, the expression “unapproachable beauty” suits her well. Her always cool and composed demeanor only adds to that impression.</p>



<p>It’s not that she actively rejects others; it’s more accurate to say that her beauty and the unique aura around her make people hesitate to approach her. When you’re in her presence, you can clearly feel that she’s on a different level.</p>



<p>These traits are present in her role as an idol as well. In a sense, she leans more towards being an artist than an idol. Her particularly serious attitude towards singing is a distinctive aspect that separates her from other idols.</p>



<p>Given her exceptional status, those who can be around her are limited to a select group of high-ranking female friends, much like the ones she’s currently chatting with.</p>



<p>Even if boys try to approach Yuki with inappropriate intentions, these girls are there to protect her. From my perspective, I can only be grateful for their work.</p>



<p>At that moment, I happened to glance over and noticed a few boys, who could be classified as ‘inappropriate,’ gathered around, discussing something about wanting to take pictures of Yuki on their smartphones.</p>



<p>…Hey, hey, do you guys not know our school rules? Just because we accept celebrities doesn’t mean we take those things lightly. Unauthorized photography is an immediate expulsion. If you try to upload it online, you’ll face double lawsuits from the school and her talent agency—your life will be over. </p>



<p>There are even rumors lately about magazine photographers or perverts showing up in the neighborhood, targeting Yuki. I don’t care if your lives get ruined, but if Yuki hears about this, she’ll be sad. So, cut it out. Seriously, stop it.</p>



<p>I send my thoughts to the excited guys. Since I’m a loner, I can’t say it directly, but in my mind, I repeat, “Stop it, stop it” at a level where it hopefully reaches them.</p>



<p>…Can you hear me? I’m addressing you directly in your hearts right now…!</p>



<p>Perhaps thanks to my efforts (though it’s probably just a coincidence), the guys ended up not taking any pictures. Instead, they began discussing how they could get closer to Yuki.</p>



<p>…Phew, somehow my oshi’s peace has been preserved—or so I thought.</p>



<p>“Hey, why not just ask her if it’s okay to take a normal picture?” (Student)</p>



<p>Immediately after hearing that, I was left dumbfounded.</p>



<p>…This is the first time I’ve been horrified by the thought process of an extrovert guy. I can’t fathom how someone can be so thoughtless. Maybe these guys aren’t the same species as me, perhaps an entirely different species…?</p>



<p>While I was pondering such thoughts, those guys, driven by their typical extrovert personalities, approached Yuki’s desk. Unfazed by the cold glares from the other high-ranking girls, they foolishly begged Yuki to take pictures with them.</p>



<p>“Sorry, but that kind of thing would be inconvenient for me.” (Yuki)</p>



<p>However, such a reckless attempt was promptly crushed by Yuki’s single sentence.</p>



<p>As expected of Yuki. She cut them down with a single stroke without even raising an eyebrow. Her expressionless face showed no sign of contempt; rather, it was refreshing to watch in its mercilessness.</p>



<p>Watching the guys retreat to their seats, I heaved a sigh of relief and, for some reason, felt like I had completed a task. Once again, I gazed at Yuki, who was chatting with her friends. Finding solace in her presence, I felt ready to tackle the rest of the day.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>“…Okay. All set and ready to go.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>On that night.</p>



<p>I sat in front of my PC in my room, confirming that everything was ready for standby.</p>



<p>Today, there’s an important event.</p>



<p>Guess what? Yuki is going to appear on a live talk show on YouTube.</p>



<p>The channel is called ‘Nuts’ Event Talk’, and the base premise is that the host will invite various personalities such as YouTubers, gamers, celebrities, and sports players to showcase a different side of themselves.</p>



<p>Nuts-san, the channel owner and host, uses her witty talk to bring out the new charm of the guests, making it a wildly popular channel with a massive number of subscribers and supporters.</p>



<p>With Yuki set to appear in this upcoming livestream, it’s absolutely impossible for a Yuki fan like me to miss it.</p>



<p>I’ve even prepared to record it and have a backup plan in place in case that fails.</p>



<p>Looking at the clock, I realize it’s starting in just a little over ten minutes. My excitement is reaching its peak. The thought that I might see a side of Yuki that I’ve never seen before… it’s too much to handle.</p>



<p>Moreover, there’s another reason for my excitement.</p>



<p>After the end of the stream, the live stream for ‘Mariel-sama’ will start.</p>



<p>—Daitenin Mariel</p>



<p>She is a popular VTuber affiliated with the major VTuber agency ‘Twinkle Live’. For context, she reached several million subscribers in just under a month after her debut.</p>



<p>I was one of the people who watched her streams when she first debuted, and I found her content so entertaining that I immediately subscribed to her channel and became a member.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve been following Mariel-sama’s streams without fail, and she has become my favorite oshi among the many VTubers out there.</p>



<p>My oshi idol Yuki and my oshi VTuber Mariel-sama.</p>



<p>Being able to watch the live streams of both of them one after another is nothing short of pure happiness for a devoted fan like me.</p>



<p>“I even got to see Yuki at school today. Today might be the best day of my life, after all!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>My excitement might be a bit too much, as I’m even talking to myself.</p>



<p>Well, that’s just how excited I am waiting for the live stream to start.</p>



<p><em>*Konkon*</em></p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, is now a good time?” (Sana)</p>



<p>At that moment, a knock could be heard, and my imouto (<em>little sister</em>), Sana, peeked in from behind the door.</p>



<p>“Hmm? Sana, yeah it’s fine. What’s up?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I turned to respond, Sana entered the room without hesitation.</p>



<p>When she stands in front of me, my petite sister has to look up at me due to our height difference. Initially, it seemed somewhat strange and almost ticklish, but after six months, I’ve grown used to it.</p>



<p>With her wide, expressive eyes and a perfectly shaped face resembling a doll, she’s a beautiful girl who, despite being two years younger, is in her third year of junior high. However, she looks nothing like me.</p>



<p>And there’s a reason for that – Sana is my step-sister, with no blood relation. She became a part of the family when our father remarried six months ago.</p>



<p>Initially, having a step-sister was a bit bewildering, something that seemed to exist only in anime or light novels. However, now I feel like we’ve become close – at least that’s what I want to believe.</p>



<p>Well, Sana doesn’t seem to have any strange reservations about me, and I like to think that she feels the same way about me. I’ve had plenty of experience becoming a step-brother in games, so I’m sure we’re getting along just fine.</p>



<p>“…I’ve just finished making a new cos, and I’d like you to see it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>With such thoughts in mind, Sana spoke in her usual flat tone.</p>



<p>By the way, ‘cos’ refers to cosplay costumes.</p>



<p>Actually, my sister has a hobby of cosplaying, and she often shows off her outfits to me.</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. …Ah, but not right now.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I started to nod at her words for a moment but immediately stopped myself. It’s not good right now.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, there’s a live stream with Yuki starting soon. After that, there’s Mariel-sama’s stream, so it’s a bit tricky today.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Mm.” (Sana)</p>



<p>In response to my words, Sana visibly furrowed her brows. Her cheeks slightly puffed up, revealing a clear look of displeasure.</p>



<p>“Refusing your imouto’s request, you really are a hopeless idol and VTuber otaku.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right. I’m an idol and VTuber otaku, so what?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…You’re so shameless about it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Haha, well, because there’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in being an idol and V-tuber otaku. If anything, I take pride in being both.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p id="no1">“…You’re so shamelessly proud of it. Onii-chan <a href="#footnote">ecchi, hentai, sukebe</a><a href="#footnote"><sup>1</sup></a>.” (Sana)</p>



<p id="no2">“Sister dearest, you’re too naive. Assuming that I don’t look at Yuki and Mariel-sama with such twisted eyes, for an otaku, those words are no longer insults, but rather compliments! <a href="#footnote">Being able to acknowledge and transcend one’s own libido is an extreme feat that only an otaku can achieve!<sup>2</sup></a>” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…You’re creepy.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry. Please forgive me.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I apologized with a bow to Sana, who was giving me a disapproving look.</p>



<p>Hentai and sukebe are fine, but ‘creepy’ is tough to handle. Even if an otaku tries to act tough, they generally have delicate hearts, so please refrain from using words that can genuinely hurt!</p>



<p>“On a serious note, please spare me for today, I’m begging you! I’ve been looking forward to today’s livestream for a long time!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Well, fine. I’ll look for you another time.” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I clasped my hands and pleaded, Sana sighed with a resigned expression.</p>



<p>Despite the banter, Sana genuinely understands my hobbies, including my gaming channel. She shows consideration, and even though she may throw teasing remarks, there’s no malice behind them. In fact, I appreciate Sana’s somewhat sharp tongue; it makes me feel like she sees me as a family member.</p>



<p>Ah, just to make it clear, I’m not some masochist who enjoys being insulted, okay?</p>



<p>“…Why are you grinning like that? Are you that excited about your idol and VTuber livestreams? Hmph.” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I was having this heartwarming moment about my sister, she seemed to misunderstand something and showed an even more irritated expression. Somehow, her words now sound sharper than before?</p>



<p>Sana always seemed displeased whenever I talked about my oshis. Maybe she’s not a big fan of idols or VTubers.</p>



<p>Sana turned on her heels and left the room without saying anything.</p>



<p>“Sorry. I’ll properly indulge you next time—wait, the time!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>While all this was happening, it was time for the live stream, so I quickly settled down in front of my PC.</p>



<p>Opening the live stream, it seemed to have just started. The usual opening played along with lively music, and I found myself swaying to the beat. Yeah, pretty creepy, I admit.</p>



<p>“(Alright, it’s time for today’s Nuts Event Talk!)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>As that ended, a super anime-voiced Kansai dialect came through, and a girl with a smile that could pass for an elementary school student appeared. This girl is Nuts-san, the host of the channel. By the way, despite her appearance, she’s confirmed to be an adult, making the concept of age seem like it has a bug.</p>



<p>“(Now, now, today’s guest that everyone’s been waiting for! One of the Five Archangels of the top idol group, @ngeL25… Let’s welcome Yuki, aka Nozomi Yukina-san!)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Good evening, Nozomi Yukina <em>desu</em>.)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Yuki’s hereee!!!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Just after Nuts’ introduction, Yuki appeared, and I couldn’t help but clench my fists.</p>



<p>Yuki during her concert is cute, but Yuki through the screen is also unbelievably cute…!</p>



<p>No, Yuki has always been too angelic. She’s so precious it makes me genuinely tremble. Uh-oh, my excitement is getting too high, and I’m starting to fidget.</p>



<p>“(Today, we’ll introduce everyone to Yuki’s unknown charms. So, Yuki-san, thanks for being with us today!)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Yes, thank you very much for having me.)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Responding to Nuts’ playful introduction with a sincere reply… even to such casual reactions, I couldn’t help but release a deep sigh of admiration. Seriously, she’s so precious…!</p>



<p>And so, the livestream began, and I focused intently on the screen, not wanting to miss any aspect of Yuki. I may be recording it, but I wanted to engrave every detail in my memory as well.</p>



<p>The livestream proceeded to progress smoothly without any hiccups. Guided by Nuts-san’s witty talk, Yuki answered in her usual cool and serious demeanor. The mood remained pleasant throughout, and Yuki’s charm, with her calm demeanor, was effectively conveyed.</p>



<p>The number of concurrent viewers reached an impressive one hundred thousand, and the comment section was buzzing with excitement. Somehow, I felt proud of my oshi’s popularity. </p>



<p>It’s a bit embarrassing, but when you realize that this incredibly beautiful angel is your oshi, you can’t help but want to announce it to the world.!</p>



<p>“(Eh, so Yuki-san is a dog person, huh?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Yes, that’s right. I have one at home, a Shiba Inu.)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“(…I see. I knew Yuki liked dogs, but I didn’t know the breed was a Shiba Inu.)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>As I watched the livestream, I nodded repeatedly, considering this new piece of valuable information.</p>



<p>Even though I don’t think there’s anyone questioning the sanity of knowing such detailed information, I’ll mention it just in case. Fans want to know everything about their oshis. Knowing these kinds of details allows us to imagine Yuki happily playing with her pet dog every time we see a Shiba Inu. It’s truly precious.</p>



<p>The talk covered a wide range of topics, including the usual ones like hobbies and favorite foods, but also unique information that you wouldn’t hear outside of this livestream. Questions like where she wanted to travel, the first song she bought and listened to, or what she would bring if she could only take one thing to a deserted island. I silently gave a thumbs up to Nuts-san for asking great questions and gratefully stored Yuki’s answers in my heart.</p>



<p>“(By the way, what do you do during your days off lately?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Well, recently, I’ve been playing games. I’m not really good at it, though.)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Soon, the conversation shifted to how Yuki spends her days off, and when she mentioned the word “game”, I couldn’t help but react.</p>



<p>…Yuki play games? That’s news to me! Seriously?</p>



<p>As a gaming enthusiast, this was the most interesting topic I had heard so far, and I found myself leaning forward involuntarily.</p>



<p>“(Oh, that’s unexpected. By the way, what kind of games do you play?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Well, it’s a game called Line of Fire—)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“(Eh!? LoF!?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>And in the next moment, I found myself almost standing up from my chair.</p>



<p>Line of Fire—commonly known as LoF.</p>



<p>It’s a team-based battle royale FPS released about a year ago, and it became a massive hit with many gamers entering the scene due to its high quality.</p>



<p>I had been part of LoF since the beta release, and truth be told, it was this game that inspired me to start doing game commentary. It’s a game I love, and it’s also the main content on my YouTube channel. Seriously, it’s an amazing game, so everyone should play it.</p>



<p>Given the emotional connection I had with this title, I never expected to hear it come from Yuki’s mouth, and I was quite surprised.</p>



<p>“(Oh, LoF, huh? It’s really popular right now. I play it too, but to think that Yuki-san is playing it as well, that’s amazing. By the way, how good are you?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Well, I’m really not good at it. I haven’t played many games, so it’s quite challenging for me… But it’s a lot of fun.)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Wow, seriously! Yuki playing LoF… Wow!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>With a smile, Yuki’s response sent my excitement skyrocketing.</p>



<p>Playing a game that your oshi enjoys—just thinking about it makes me incredibly happy.</p>



<p>“Maybe, somewhere out there, Yuki and I have been matched in a game…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but let my imagination run wild, squirming in delight.</p>



<p>I know my imagination is running wild, but please bear with me. Being an otaku and not daydreaming is like having curry without roux. I don’t wanna hear stuff like, “Did you know that real curry doesn’t have roux?” Please, just let it slide!</p>



<p>Setting that aside, the discussion about Yuki and Nuts playing LoF continued.</p>



<p>“(It is, isn’t it? LoF is currently one of the hottest games out there so there are plenty of content creators playing it. I’ve even done some live commentary collabs with some of them before. Speaking of which, Yuki-san, do you watch live game commentary?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“Wow, Nuts-san, that’s an excellent question!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As someone who streams LoF, that was exactly the question I wanted to hear.</p>



<p>Of course, it’s irrelevant to a small channel like mine, but if Yuki watches any streams, I must absolutely take note.</p>



<p>With such thoughts in mind, I anxiously waited for Yuki’s response, my heart pounding.</p>



<p>But then, something unexpected happened.</p>



<p>In response to Nuts’ question, Yuki’s eyes sparkled.</p>



<p>“(Yes! Actually, there is a gaming commentary channel that I like…!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>And with that, Yuki leaned forward, delivering her response.</p>



<p>Yuki tightly clenched both hands, her face slightly flushed, and her eyes sparkling. She spoke with an enthusiasm reminiscent of a small child talking about their favorite thing. It was a side of Yuki that I had never seen before, and before savoring her cuteness, I was taken aback.</p>



<p>But the real surprise was yet to come.</p>



<p>“(Ah, your excitement suddenly went up. I don’t think I’ve seen Yuki-san like this before.)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(S-sorry, but I really love that channel…!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“(It’s fine. Since this stream is about showing a different side of you, feel free to react as you feel. So, what’s the name of the channel? If Yuki-san watches it, it must be a well-known channel, right?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(Ah, no, that channel has less than five subscribers… but regardless of that, it’s incredibly entertaining!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“(Eh? It’s a channel with single digit subscribers?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>Ignoring Nuts, who seemed genuinely surprised, Yuki nodded and, with the best smile she had shown so far, answered.</p>



<p>“(Yes. The name is Kei’s Game Commentary Channel!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“……………………..Eh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>At that moment, my body stiffened as if turned to stone.</p>



<p>I felt like I heard my own channel’s name coming out of Yuki’s mouth.</p>



<p>…No way.</p>



<p>…No, no, no. That’s impossible… No no no no!</p>



<p>…<em>Fuu</em>, this is bad. Even though I’m a dedicated Yuki fan, it’s getting weird to the point of hearing hallucinations. I must have misheard something—</p>



<p>“(Oh, really? Kei’s Game Commentary… That’s a name I’ve never heard before.)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p id="imagetext"><a href="#image">“(That’s right, Kei’s Game Commentary! I really like that channel!)” (Yukina)</a></p>



<p>But it was clear as day; In what was supposed to be a hallucination, I heard my channel’s name again.</p>



<p>“……………….” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Unable to grasp the situation, I stood there dumbfounded, staring at the screen.</p>



<p>Experiencing a brain freeze due to not being able to process information is a first for me… Well, when faced with unexpectedly bizarre situations, humans tend to freeze up. Source: Yours truly.</p>



<p>“(Heh~ Yuki-san, you really love that channel, don’t you? That channel must really be something. Is there anything you can tell us about that channel?)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>“(It’s an incredibly entertaining channel! Ever since I found it, I’ve been hooked! I watch it every day, and I never get tired of it! Oh, speaking of which, it’s a game commentary channel, mainly focusing on LoF. The person behind the channel is incredibly skilled and I can’t help but be mesmerized! I actually started playing LoF because of that channel, hoping to get closer to Kei-kun’s skill level. Oh, by the way, Kei-kun is the name of the commentator! Formally, the channel is called Kei, but I’ve always called them Kei-kun! Kei-kun is incredibly cool! His gameplay is superb, and I often wonder how they can make such moves! And his commentary is genuinely entertaining! Even though I didn’t know anything about LoF at first, his explanations are so easy to understand! When I first started watching, I got so into it that before I knew it, hours had passed! Oh, that’s not all—I also love Kei-kun’s voice! It’s not just cool; it’s warm and gentle, and I can listen to it forever! And then, and then…!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“(Oh~ you’re really passionate. It’s a completely different atmosphere from before.)” (Nuts-san)</p>



<p>In the midst of Yuki’s overwhelming enthusiasm, Nuts-san seemed quite interested in the topic.</p>



<p>From Yuki’s enthusiastic gestures and passionate explanations about the channel, it was evident that she truly loved that channel.</p>



<p>Of course, I, who was already shocked by the revelation, coupled with the impact from earlier, experienced a complete brain crash.</p>



<p>“(…That’s how it is! I’m a big fan of Kei-kun!)” (Yukina)</p>



<p>However, as Yuki concluded her lengthy speech, my head slowly began to reboot. Although the speed was comparable to an outdated CPU found in a budget laptop, at least it started moving again.</p>



<p>On the screen, Yuki wore an undisturbed smile, and the talk was still ongoing. However, the details of the conversation were no longer registering in my mind.</p>



<p>“…………Um, let’s see. First, let’s calm down. So, to summarise, Yuki seriously mentioned my channel…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I tried to organize the situation while attempting to move my malfunctioning brain. To confirm, the situation, I entered ‘Kei’s Game Commentary’ in the YouTube search bar.</p>



<p>There might be a possibility of a more prominent channel with the same name.</p>



<p>Contrary to that possibility, the search results only showed my own channel.</p>



<p>As a test, I opened the latest video uploaded this morning.</p>



<p>“Whoa!? Th-this is…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Then, the views, which had been in the single digits, had now exceeded over fifty thousand. I widened my eyes, having never seen a five-digit number before. Meanwhile, the view count was increasing at an unbelievable speed, and the comment section was flooded with an overwhelming number of comments.</p>



<p>The contents of the comments ranged from ‘I came from Nuts Channel’ to ‘Is this the one Yuki was talking about?’ to ‘Is it true that Yuki is endorsing this?’ to ‘I’m going to check it out now!’ and more. It was clear that they were viewers who heard Yuki’s statements in the ongoing livestream.</p>



<p>“What… what’s with this amount of comments…? I’ve never experienced anything like this before—wait, no, don’t lose your composure. Stay calm in situations like this… Yes, stay calm!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Despite trying to reassure myself, it was clear that this was not an easy situation to stay calm in.</p>



<p>I don’t know what to do. There’s no outlet for the overwhelming emotions surging within me. I feel unusually restless and incredibly confused. I couldn’t sit still at all.</p>



<p>After aimlessly walking around my room for a while, I decided to try to return to my usual rhythm, at least for now.</p>



<p>Let’s put this abnormal situation aside for a moment… No, no, I know I’m just running away, but still! In order to calm down, I should get back to my usual routine. Yes, routine work is essential!</p>



<p>“…Um, first, I was watching Yuki’s live appearance on Nuts Channel… So, let’s continue that… wait, it’s already over!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It seemed that the livestream had already ended while I was in a daze. I panicked as I rewind the stream to where I left off… Well, watching this won’t calm me down given that it was the source of the current confusion… I should watch this when things settle down instead.</p>



<p>“Th-then, let’s watch Mariel-sama. Mariel-sama’s livestream should be starting. I’ll just watch that and enjoy it without thinking too much. I can think about the Yuki situation later…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yeah, that’s it. That’s a good idea. If I focus on Mariel-sama’s livestream without overthinking it, my head might reset.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I headed towards Mariel-sama’s channel… but</p>



<p>“Wait, what? She’s not streaming? But there was one scheduled around this time. Could it be a sudden health issue, and she had to cancel today?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Upon learning that Mariel-sama’s stream, which I had been counting on, was suddenly canceled, I became anxious.</p>



<p>Although I’m worried about her health, I feel disappointed at the same time because I was looking forward to taking a breather with her stream, and now, with the combination of various emotions from Yuki’s situation, I become even more restless.</p>



<p>“…This can’t be happening. What should I do…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Having lost another anchor, I mindlessly wander around the room in frustration.</p>



<p>“Ah, onii-chan!” (Sana)</p>



<p>At this moment, the door suddenly burst open, and Sana rushed into the room in an unusually flustered manner.</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, your channel is trending on social media! There’s a hashtag for [Kei’s Game Commentary], and there’s also one for [Nozomi Yukina]!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Breathing heavily, Sana pointed her smartphone in my direction.</p>



<p>Indeed, as Sana mentioned, it was clear on her screen that both my commentary channel and Yukina’s name were trending simultaneously… I see, even on social media, huh?</p>



<p>“…Hey, Sana.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-What’s wrong, onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>At this point, I finally felt like I fully understood the situation.</p>



<p>Until now, the possibility that it was just my imagination couldn’t be entirely ruled out, but seeing Sana in this state made it impossible to deny.</p>



<p>With unsteady steps, I stood in front of Sana, and in a detached manner, I muttered.</p>



<p>“…I might have got caught up in Yukina’s buzz. What should I do?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>By the way, upon hearing that, Sana responded with a simple “I don’t know”, followed by “Why is this happening?” But even if she asked why, I wouldn’t have an answer because I don’t know what’s going on either.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“<em>Fuah</em>… I’m sleepy…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Early the next morning.</p>



<p>I was still in the classroom, where no one had arrived yet, sitting alone at my desk and yawning.</p>



<p>This is the first time I’ve come to school this early, so it’s kind of refreshing in a way.</p>



<p>I couldn’t get much sleep last night, and even being at home made me feel uneasy. So, I thought, why not just go to school?</p>



<p>“Ah, it feels like a completely different world from yesterday…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I muttered while looking out of the window absentmindedly, feeling sleepy but refreshed.</p>



<p>After finally accepting the reality that I was buzzed about by Yuki since yesterday, I naturally thought about various things.</p>



<p>The first thing that crossed my mind was, of course, a feeling of joy.</p>



<p>The fact that the idol I’ve been supporting for so long not only watched my livestream but also passionately supported me… Is there any other reaction I can make?</p>



<p>No, it wasn’t something that could be easily expressed with words. I was too overwhelmingly happy; before I knew it, I found myself dancing strangely in my room. It was the first time I experienced reaching such a level of happiness that my memories started to blur. Yeah.</p>



<p>Well, while I was indulging in this ultimate happiness, I was soon (quite literally) slapped back to reality by my sister who came in, saying, “You’re noisy.”</p>



<p>Even though I received Sana’s icy gaze, I was still in a daze, and you can imagine how happy I was. Seeing me unable to contain my smile even while apologizing, Sana looked down on me with a face that seemed to genuinely find me repulsive. But well, considering that the person who started this was my oshi, it couldn’t be helped.</p>



<p>However, after a while, as I gradually regained my composure, a completely different question came to my mind.</p>



<p>—What should I do from now on?</p>



<p>Firstly, there was the issue of what to do with my future streams.</p>



<p>In the end, my view counts continued to rise, and what was in single digits before skyrocketed to six digits after the buzz.</p>



<p>At the same time, the number of subscribers exceeded a hundred thousand in just one day… This feels like some sort of isekai moment.</p>



<p>Although I have concerns about whether I can continue streaming as usual in this situation, well, yeah, I’ll somehow manage. But the problem lies in another area.</p>



<p>The second issue—of course, was about Yuki.</p>



<p>Normally, when getting buzzed by a celebrity, one wouldn’t worry about the relationship with that celebrity because there is usually no direct involvement.</p>



<p>But in my case with Yuki, it’s different.</p>



<p>Yuki is my classmate, and she doesn’t know that Kei is me.</p>



<p>Should I reveal to Yuki that I am Kei? Both of us are fans of each other, after all.</p>



<p>However, the answer to that question came quickly. Of course, it’s a resounding NO.</p>



<p>No, not just with Yuki, it’s just not a good idea to reveal my channel to anyone.</p>



<p>Originally, I hadn’t told anyone other than my family that I have a game commentary YouTube channel.</p>



<p>Well, being a loner at school, there wasn’t anyone to share that kind of information with… but that’s beside the point!</p>



<p>First, it’s about my belief in maintaining a certain distance from my oshi.</p>



<p>My oshi idol is like a being from another dimension. I believe in keeping an appropriate distance, but if it becomes known that I am Kei, the distance with Yuki would undoubtedly narrow.</p>



<p>Hmm? But if you’re a fan of Yuki, wouldn’t that be a good thing? Isn’t it a good opportunity?</p>



<p>Some people might think that way, but for those folks, I’d like to say, take a seat for a moment. You don’t understand a thing.</p>



<p>Sure, even I have thoughts like wanting to talk to Yuki face-to-face, wanting her to direct that smile only at me—honestly, I’ve had those fantasies before. It’s unavoidable, isn’t it? I’m only human.</p>



<p>But, you see, it’s different. The relationship between a fan and their oshi idol isn’t like that.</p>



<p>Moreover, trying to get closer to Yuki using the buzz—That, in my opinion, is far from the image of a “true fan”. In a word, impure. As someone who supports Yuki purely as a fan, the presence of such impurity is already a deal-breaker for me.</p>



<p>And there’s another issue—actually, this one is more significant in reality. I’m worried that if Yuki finds out that Kei’s true identity is me, she might be disillusioned.</p>



<p>Think about it. If your beloved game commentator turned out to be the unsociable loner from your class…?</p>



<p>…I know, it sounds ridiculous when I say it myself, but this kind of gap is not cool.</p>



<p>The charm of a gap usually turns a negative impression into a positive one. However, when the positive turns into a negative, it’s precisely disillusionment. In other words, disappointment.</p>



<p>To be disappointed by Yuki after she learns my true identity… just thinking about it makes me want to die!</p>



<p>I just want to make it clear that I’m not trying to belittle myself or anything. I have no shame in being an otaku, a loner, or an introvert. In fact, I take pride in it. I couldn’t care less about how others perceive me.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to Yuki, it’s a different story.</p>



<p>Even if Yuki doesn’t end up disappointed in me, there’s still the possibility that her reputation might suffer for supporting someone like me, an introvert. If that happens, as a fan, I might have to sincerely apologize and make amends.</p>



<p>As long as there’s even a slight chance of tarnishing Yuki’s reputation, I can’t bring myself to reveal that I am Kei. Besides, there’s really no need for it.</p>



<p>Therefore, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll keep my identity a secret from everyone, but I’ll continue to work hard at game commentary, knowing that Yuki is supporting me. That’s my decision.</p>



<p>Nothing much should change aside from the fact that I’ll need to cater to my rapidly growing channel.</p>



<p>To avoid embarrassing Yuki, I need to ensure that my the quality of my channel lives up to the support that Yuki gave me. </p>



<p>While there may be uncertainties ahead, the stronger motivation is the desire to provide content that Yuki will continue to enjoy. I take out my smartphone and launch the mobile version of LoF.</p>



<p>As part of the content enhancement plan, I decided yesterday to gradually increase the number of videos on the mobile version of the game.</p>



<p>While the PC version is the mainstream for LoF, the recently released mobile version is gaining widespread popularity relatively quickly. I haven’t played much of the mobile version until now, but I decided to dive into it with this opportunity.</p>



<p>In the early morning, with no one around in the classroom, it’s the perfect environment for practice. Now, which map to choose… Mist Island, huh? Visibility is challenging here, so it’s better to focus on close-quarters weapons. However, I need to remember that some characters can excel in long-range combat.</p>



<p>As I start the match, I simulate the commentary in my mind, considering the differences in gameplay from the PC version.</p>



<p>While there are some differences in mechanics, the gameplay itself progresses smoothly.</p>



<p>“Hmm, my weapon and my teammates’ choices aren’t that great…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Unconsciously, the commentary that I had kept in my mind starts slipping out of my mouth.</p>



<p>However, deeply engrossed in the game, I don’t notice it and become even more immersed.</p>



<p>“In situations like this, it’s essential to actively find enemy units and steal their supplies—ah, there! The other side of the mist just flashed for a moment. Mist Island is said to rely on sound cues for strategy on some gaming sites, but in reality, the sound echoes aren’t much different from other maps. Instead, it’s the reflection of muzzle flashes in the mist that’s unique, so it’s crucial to use that to locate enemy positions—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh, really?” (?)</p>



<p>At that moment, a voice suddenly comes from nearby, causing my body to jolt.</p>



<p>It might have been a surprise attack, but what struck me more was the familiarity of that voice. In a panic, I swiftly turned around.</p>



<p>“Yu-Yu-Yuki…!? No, Yukina-san!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>There, unexpectedly close, was the face of my oshi, and I was completely flustered.</p>



<p>W-Why is Yuki in the classroom at this hour…!?</p>



<p>“Ah, I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to disturb you… I just got curious about what you were doing, so I…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Seeing me almost drop my phone from shock, Yuki’s expression clouded with regret. However, I quickly shook my head vigorously.</p>



<p>“N-No, that’s not it! You’re not bothering me or anything! I was just a bit surprised!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Really? That’s a relief.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Relieved, Yuki flashed a smile, and I quickly averted my gaze.</p>



<p>Part of the reason was due to getting caught off guard by my oshi’s sudden appearance, but the truth was, her smile was so dazzling that I couldn’t look directly at her. Plus, she’s too close…!</p>



<p>“T-There was no one here, so I was killing time by playing a game…! That’s all…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Without making eye contact with Yuki, I tried to end the conversation.</p>



<p>As someone who values the appropriate distance with their oshi, this situation was not ideal…!</p>



<p>“By the way, that’s LoF, right? Amamiya-kun also plays LoF, huh?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>However, Yuki continued the conversation, unaware of my thoughts.</p>



<p>That fact was surprising, but even more shocking was being addressed by my name.</p>



<p>“W-Why my name!?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Because we’re classmates…? Ah, but this is our first time talking, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>…W-Wait, she remembered my name!? That Yuki remembered my name even though we never talked!? What? Is she seriously an angel…!?</p>



<p>“Ah, Amamiya-kun, an enemy’s approaching.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>While I was still amazed by this shocking revelation, Yuki pointed at the phone screen and said so.</p>



<p>I snapped back to reality and focused on the game. I was still shaken, feeling anxious with Yuki beside me, but as a gamer, I couldn’t just abandon the game I was playing.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my teammates responded quickly, and the enemy’s movements were sluggish, so we easily dealt with the incoming attack. However, my real-life situation was still far from calm.</p>



<p>“S-So, um, Yuki…na…san, why are you at school at this early hour?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>In an attempt to regain composure, I asked the question that had been on my mind.</p>



<p>Of course, I still avoided looking at Yuki. If I did, I would definitely get flustered again. Even now, there was a nice fragrance drifting in the air.</p>



<p>“Ah, right. Actually, I got so excited yesterday that I couldn’t sleep much. I woke up early in the morning and thought, ‘Why not go to school?’ Since I can’t come on workdays, I wanted to come to school whenever I had the chance.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>I see. As expected of Yuki, even her reasons are as pure as an angel. I find myself even more devoted.</p>



<p>“What about you, Amamiya-kun? Do you always come this early?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I’m in a similar situation.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. What a coincidence. Um, if it’s okay, can I continue watching you play LoF?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>I actually wanted her to keep some distance, but unable to say such a thing, I silently nodded.</p>



<p>Having my oshi next to me is an incredibly lucky event, but due to the circumstances, I can’t openly enjoy it, and that’s what makes it painful.</p>



<p>…No, what’s the use of being flustered? Since I’ve decided to keep the fact that I’m Kei a secret, I need to stick to that decision, especially in front of her.</p>



<p>Thinking this way, I forcibly switched my focus back to the game.</p>



<p>The match was already approaching its end, with the initial thirty squads reduced to just four.</p>



<p>The playing field had shrunk to its limits, and gunfire echoed from all directions. The end of the game was near. Due to the limited visibility caused by the mist, we would have to be prepared to engage in close-quarter combat at any time.</p>



<p>“…One squad on the right, two on the left.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Based on the gunfire around me, I quickly estimated the positions of nearby enemies and decided to launch a surprise attack on the squad to the right.</p>



<p>I silently approached them and used a grenade to fish them out before hitting them from another angle.</p>



<p>With the support of my teammates, the play worked, and the right squad was completely eliminated. Checking the remaining squads, there were only two left. it seemed like the two squads to the left had run into each other.</p>



<p>However, at that moment, the last enemy squad suddenly emerged from the mist. They probably heard the gunfire and intended to attack before we could regroup and recover.</p>



<p>In response, we engaged them. It became a chaotic three-on-three battle in the narrow area.</p>



<p>Gunshots and muzzle flashes scattered in the mist. But in the end, our squad stood victorious amidst the chaos. The screen displayed the word “Champion”, and we had secured victory barely.</p>



<p>“<em>Fuu</em>… we managed to win.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I sighed deeply while muttering those words. Despite being thrown off by Yuki’s sudden appearance, once I focused on the game, I could play properly. I felt like praising my gamer spirit.</p>



<p>Now, we’ve successfully won the game, but the issue is the current situation. If Yuki were to say something like “You’re amazing!” in person, I might become too happy and reach my limit. No, I’m definitely going to. I’m confident about that.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no way I would let her see me in that state, so I should find a way to escape from this situation before she says anything. It might not be graceful, but I should head to the bathroom or something before she has the chance.</p>



<p>While thinking about that, I turned to look at Yuki. Right before I opened my mouth, I ended up swallowing the words that I was going to say.</p>



<p>“…………Eh?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>The reason being, for some unknown reason, Yuki’s eyes were wide open and was staring at me in silence. …What beautiful eyes she has—now’s not the time for that! Why does she look surprised?</p>



<p>“…Could it be, Kei-kun…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“What!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, the next moment, I was the one surprised.</p>



<p>…What!? Did she just call me “Kei-kun”?</p>



<p>“W-w-w-what!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Kei-kun… it’s you, right?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…Why!? How!?</p>



<p>I was thrown into great confusion by this sudden turn of events. Meanwhile, Yuki was approaching me with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“W-w-w-what are you talking about? I-I have no idea what you’re saying!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I desperately tried to play dumb. Despite having just resolved not to let my secret out, I was already at risk of being exposed. But, I couldn’t afford to give in. I need to get through this somehow!</p>



<p>“…Actually, I had a feeling from the start.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>But Yuki continued, staring at me intently.</p>



<p>“Amamiya-kun’s voice sounds just like Kei-kun’s. So, I got curious and approached you.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Is that so!? That’s an incredible coincidence, right!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I tried to play it off while my heart was pounding.</p>



<p>However, Yuki continued calmly, shaking her head.</p>



<p id="no1">“The way you talk, the <a href="#footnote">intonation<sup>1</sup></a>, and even the way you play are exactly the same as Kei-kun. The final winning strategy was also a classic Kei-kun move, using a diversion to flank the enemy from the side, right?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-well, that’s a common strategy in LoF, you know!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…She’s really observant! To remember the common tactics I use… she must be watching my streams so diligently. But wait, this isn’t the time to be happy about that!</p>



<p>“Not just that. Your choice of character, weapon, and especially that skin—It’s the one you always use, the limited edition model distributed during the first-anniversary event, right?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Huh? Oh…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Given to those who achieved 1000 kills during the event period, and Kei-kun did a stream trying to achieve it within fifty games, right? He said he managed to achieve it by defeating the opponent in the middle of a melee. By the way, the opponent was using the default skin, Snow Fox, and the weapon Kei-kun picked up during the melee was the RG105. I vividly remember because I watched it a lot of times.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki calmly presented her evidence, leaving me speechless with no way to refute it.</p>



<p>…The skin part is true, but why does she remember so many details, even the opponent and the weapon I used? I don’t even recall those myself!</p>



<p>“Hey, Amamiya-kun is Kei-kun, right? That’s it, isn’t it…?”</p>



<p>With a serious expression, Yuki approached, and I instinctively stepped back.</p>



<p>…What should I do? How do I handle this situation? And Yuki-san, why does she feel a bit scary? Her usual cool and beautiful demeanor now seems oddly intimidating!</p>



<p>Is it because she’s disappointed, thinking that Kei’s true identity is someone like me!? I need to get out of this somehow…!</p>



<p>“Oh, guess we’re not the first.” (Student)</p>



<p>“Hey, isn’t that Yuki!? …And, Amamiya?” (Student)</p>



<p>At that moment, two male classmates entered the classroom.</p>



<p>Seeing the unexpected pair of me and Yuki, they tilted their heads in confusion.</p>



<p>…Phew, maybe this is a relief? Since someone else came in, we can pretend nothing happened for now—</p>



<p>“Sorry. Come with me for a moment.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>But at that moment, Yuki grabbed my hand and rushed out of the classroom. Both the two boys and I were left with wide eyes at this sudden action.</p>



<p>Without looking back, Yuki continued to pull me through the corridor, ran up the stairs, and opened the door leading to the rooftop.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa…</em> <em>Haa</em>… W-why are we…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Out of breath, I found myself on the rooftop in no time. I gasped for air and expressed my natural confusion.</p>



<p>Yet, Yuki, without showing any signs of being out of breath, apologized briefly and then fixed her serious gaze on me again.</p>



<p>“I just needed to make sure. … Amamiya-kun, are you really Kei-kun?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As Yuki leaned in, I instinctively stepped back, only to find myself against the rooftop’s wire fence with no escape.</p>



<p>Realizing that I was cornered, I was forced to make a decision.</p>



<p>I shouldn’t reveal that I’m Kei. However, her eyes conveyed that she wouldn’t back down until she got a satisfactory answer.</p>



<p>I considered trying to bluff my way through, but the atmosphere didn’t seem right for it. My instincts told me I couldn’t keep up the act any longer. If it came to this, I might as well confess.</p>



<p>Damn it! This rooftop was supposed to be a place of dreams where confessions happen! Why is such a dire event happening here? Ugh!</p>



<p>“…Y-Yes, that’s right. I am Kei…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Finally, I confessed, in a voice barely louder than a mosquito’s.</p>



<p>Despite the brave atmosphere I tried to put up that seemed like I’d mentally prepared for this, the thought that Yuki might be disappointed made my heart wither. If she gave me a look of “Ugh…” or something like that, I might just collapse right here.</p>



<p>“…I-I thought so.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki lowered her head, listening to my response, and her shoulders trembled. … As expected, this reaction.</p>



<p>But it can’t be helped. Considering how much she had been hyping up her oshi YouTuber, finding out that he was just an unimpressive classmate would naturally result in—</p>



<p>“Whaaaat?! I-I actually met the real Kei-kun!! What should I do, what should I do, what should I doooooo!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Uwah!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I was startled by Yuki suddenly raising her voice, causing the wire mesh to shake.</p>



<p>Yuki’s face turned bright red and she covered her cheeks with both hands while continuing to shake her head vigorously.</p>



<p>“I-I never thought I’d meet Kei-kun in a place like this…! What do I do?! I’m sleep-deprived, and I didn’t style my hair properly…! Ahhh <em>mouu</em>, what should I do!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“……………………” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Um… what on earth is happening here?</p>



<p>“U-Um, Yukina-san…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Hyaaaa!? Y-You called me Yukina just now!? Kei-kun called me by my real name…!? Ah, I feel so happy that I might die…! And it’s even your real voice! Kei-kun’s real voice is too precious…! Um, how much does it cost for you to address me by my name like that? I’ll definitely pay for it!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“What are you talking about!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…I couldn’t help but retort at the utter incomprehensibility! </p>



<p>“S-Sorry! I, um, my head is a bit confused…! So, um, Yukinna-san, you know that I’m the YouTuber Kei, and you’re not disappointed or anything… right?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I cautiously asked the question that worried me the most.</p>



<p>Even though I said it cautiously, it turned out to be a quite straightforward question. But please understand that my head can’t keep up with this situation.</p>



<p>“Disappointed? Why would I be?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Well, you know, having your oshi YouTuber as a classmate…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Kei-kun being my classmate is such a wonderful coincidence! I never thought I’d meet the real Kei-kun in a place like this…! I-is this fate!? Oh, thinking about it makes me so happy, whaa… What should I do!? Having the real Kei-kun in front of me is just too incredible…! Um, what should I do!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Even if you ask me that!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki let out a strange ‘<em>Fuwa~</em>’ sound while squirming with a bright red face.</p>



<p>It’s hard to put it into words, but her excessively high tension was like the epitome of an otaku at their limit. As I watched from the side, I was struck by the phenomenon that the more excited the other person became, the more I, as an observer, could maintain my composure in return.</p>



<p>In a situation where it wouldn’t be strange for me to be overwhelmed, it felt like Yuki was getting excited on my behalf as well.</p>



<p>…What should I do? Seriously, what should I do!? Well, for now, it seems like she isn’t disappointed that I’m Kei…</p>



<p id="no2">As I watched Yuki happily <a href="#footnote">frolicking<sup>2</sup></a> around, I felt completely at a loss.</p>



<p>Wait a minute. Is it just me, or is Yuki’s character a bit different? The Yuki I know has a more artistic vibe, like a cool, high-class girl with an elegant aura…</p>



<p>But looking at Yuki blushing with a genuinely happy smile gave off a completely different impression from the usual idol-like Yuki. It’s like… she’s a normal, down-to-earth girl, and she’s incredibly cute!?</p>



<p>Even though I managed to keep my composure, I’m a huge fan of Yuki as well.</p>



<p>If she keeps showing such a cute side right in front of me, I might reach my limit too. This is getting dangerous.</p>



<p>“…Ah, I-I’m sorry! I got too excited by myself…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki had been energetically caught up in her own excitement for a while, but eventually, she snapped back to reality and bowed her head, apologizing.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry…! I didn’t expect to meet Kei-kun in real life, so I got carried away…! B-But I’m a big fan of Kei-kun…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki fumbled her words and her eyes were slightly teary.</p>



<p>She seemed desperate, mixing in gestures, but seeing her like that made me anxious.</p>



<p>“I’ve been watching your videos for a long time…! Ah, I even made sure to watch all your live streams! I comment all the time, and when I get a reply from Kei-kun, it would make me happy for the rest of the day…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Comments… Wait, seriously?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, um, I’m ‘Wankoromochi’! D-Do you remember me…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Wait, that was you, Yukina-san!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Since ‘wankoromochi’ was the only one consistently commenting on my videos, there’s no way I could forget. However, I never expected that I had been interacting with Yuki all this time, so I was genuinely shocked.</p>



<p>Despite my bewildered reaction, Yuki showed a genuinely happy smile, saying, “You remembered…!”</p>



<p>“That’s right, I’m ‘wankoromochi’! I thought maybe it’s annoying to comment so much, but I just couldn’t resist…! During live streams, and of course, whenever a new video was uploaded, I always do my best to comment right away….!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…Now that she mentioned it, I was always surprised by how quickly those comments appeared.</p>



<p>“Ah, w-was it bothersome after all? I was worried that commenting so frequently might be weird…! I-if you thought it was creepy or anything…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-well, yeah…! I mean, I’m a bit creepy, aren’t I…?! Even now, meeting Kei-kun in real life makes me really excited…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“N-no, wait a minute.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“B-But still…! I’m a big fan of yours, and meeting you like this made me so happy…! It might be annoying, but I just want you to understand that feeling…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yuki’s expression clouded with unease, but she desperately pleaded her case.</p>



<p>How much she supports Kei, and how genuine those feelings are.</p>



<p>What stood before me was not the top idol Yuki but a simple fangirl, and as a fan of Yuki myself, I was left speechless by the gap.</p>



<p>However, at the same time, I felt a strange sense of familiarity seeing her in that state.</p>



<p>Breaking down and losing composure in front of one’s oshi— wasn’t that no different from me?</p>



<p>“Um, Yukina-san.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“H-Hyaa!? I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“No, no need to apologize! Um… I don’t find it bothersome at all. In fact, the opposite, I’m really happy right now too…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh, even Kei-kun…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“That’s because, you see… I’ve also been a fan of Yuki all this time.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eeeeh!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…I said it. I didn’t plan to say it, but seeing Yuki so desperate, I couldn’t help myself.</p>



<p>“Fan!? M-Me!? W-Why would Kei-kun…!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Isn’t that reaction a bit much!? I mean, you’re an idol, so it’s way more normal for me to be your fan than the other way around, isn’t it!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“B-but, but, but! F-For Kei-kun to be like that…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As Yuki blushed and got flustered, I explained how Yuki became my oshi.</p>



<p>Finding out there was an idol at my school during my first year, doing some research, getting hooked, and being secretly delighted when we ended up in the same class this year…</p>



<p>…Talking about all that in front of the person herself is so embarrassing!</p>



<p>But considering that Yuki probably felt the same way earlier, I couldn’t help but say it. It just felt… unfair.</p>



<p>“N-No way…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As I finished talking, Yuki stared at me with wide eyes. Eventually, tears welled up in those eyes, streaming down her cheeks—tears!?</p>



<p>“Wait!? W-why are you crying…!? D-Did it make you feel uncomfortable!? But, um, I want you to know, I’m not a stalker or anything! S-So, um, I’m really really sorry!!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Realizing I made my oshi cry, I was in utter panic.</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by a sense of guilt, I found myself bowing my head profusely, almost in a kneeling position, to apologize.</p>



<p>“N-no…! It’s not like that…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki wiped her eyes vigorously, trying to squeeze out her words.</p>



<p>“I-it’s not like that…! I’m happy…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“B-because, I never thought that my oshi was also a fan of me…! I can’t believe it…! I’m so, so happy…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As Yuki continued speaking, I hurriedly offered her a handkerchief. She took it, wiped away her tears, and though her eyes were still red, a radiant smile adorned her face.</p>



<p>“<em>*Sniff*</em>… We’re both each other’s fans, aren’t we…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Uh, I wonder if there’s another term for that…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but retort, but Yuki didn’t seem bothered at all. Clutching the handkerchief tightly, she had completely shaken off the tears from earlier and was now showing a bright happy smile.</p>



<p>…T-This is bad. She’s too cute…!</p>



<p>I quickly averted my gaze and took a small deep breath, trying to regain my composure.</p>



<p>I accidentally revealed that I’m Kei, and on top of that, I unintentionally mentioned that I’m a fan of Yuki. It couldn’t be helped this time, but from now on, I needed to be more careful.</p>



<p>While I’m genuinely happy that Yuki’s a fan of mine, precisely because of that, I want to avoid causing any trouble for her. As ‘duo fans’, I really need to set clear boundaries.</p>



<p>“Ehehehe… Kei-kun’s handkerchief…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>While I was caught up in my thoughts, Yuki basked in a fluffy atmosphere of happiness.</p>



<p>…Damn it, she’s really cute. My oshi is too cute, it’s painful…!</p>



<p>“Um, …Kei-kun?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“W-What is it?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p id="imagetext"><a href="#image">“I’m really happy to have met Kei-kun like this. I’ve liked Kei-kun for a while now, but meeting the real Kei-kun in person makes me like you even more. Thinking that I can be with Kei-kun not only during streams but also at school makes me incredibly happy…”</a> (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Huh? T-that’s…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Hearing Yuki’s words, I involuntarily tensed up.</p>



<p>…But being together at school would cause problems, wouldn’t it?</p>



<p>However, Yuki, oblivious to my internal turmoil, continued.</p>



<p>“So, can I continue to support Kei-kun from now on…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Her gaze was somewhat shy, looking up with a mixture of anxiety and expectation. With that expression, making such a request to your fan…</p>



<p>“…Y-Yes, of course, please continue to support me…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>There was no other answer I could give.</p>



<p>There is indeed a belief in maintaining an appropriate distance from your oshi within me.</p>



<p>However…</p>



<p>“….Yes!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>However, I couldn’t bring myself to tarnish this wonderful smile.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Kei-kun! Really, thank you…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Seeing Yuki, overcome with emotion and tears welling up again, I couldn’t help but think once more:</p>



<p>…My favorite is truly the cutest.</p>



<p>“Oh, right! A photo…! Can we take a picture together to commemorate this!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“…Huh? But I thought you might find that troublesome, Yukina-san…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“? Did I say something like that?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As Yuki tilted her head in confusion, I couldn’t help but find even her innocent side cute too.</p>

<p><em><a href="#imagetext">“I’m really happy to have met Kei-kun like this. I’ve liked Kei-kun for a while now, but meeting the real Kei-kun in person makes me like you even more.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>“Ah, they’re back!” (Student)</p>



<p>“Seriously, Yuki, you’re with Amamiya?” (Student)</p>



<p>“Huh? What’s going on?” (Student)</p>



<p>Upon returning to the classroom, I felt the gaze of my classmates converging on us.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t surprising. After all, Yuki had been dragging me along, and the two of us had disappeared together. It was bound to become a topic of gossip.</p>



<p>As expected, the story had already spread, and with many students already at school, despite being somewhat mentally prepared, it felt incredibly uncomfortable.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, where were you guys going? What’s the relationship between Yuki and Amamiya?” (Girl)</p>



<p>In the midst of this, one of the girls who always hung out with Yuki stepped forward and asked the question directly to us.</p>



<p>It seemed like she had already been designated as the spokesperson for the question. Our class sure was prepared.</p>



<p>“…Kei-kun, Kei-kun.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>While pondering such things, I suddenly heard a whisper in my ear.</p>



<p>Yuki was whispering to me, and the ticklish sensation made my brain momentarily feel like it was melting. D-Dangerous.</p>



<p>“…Kei-kun, I’ll keep the fact that you’re ‘Kei’ a secret, okay?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>However, upon hearing those words that followed, I was taken aback.</p>



<p>…Yuki, are you really looking out for me? What an angel…</p>



<p>“S-She’s whispering!?” (Student)</p>



<p>“I-I’m so jealous…!” (Student)</p>



<p>“What kind of relationship is this!?” (Student)</p>



<p>Naturally, the entire classroom became restless as they witnessed Yuki’s actions.</p>



<p>Some voices echoed the misunderstanding I had predicted, saying things like, “Could those two be dating…?” or “Yuki’s boyfriend!?” and so on.</p>



<p>…Well, it’s to be expected. In that case, there’s only one action for me to take.</p>



<p>“N-No, everyone, it’s not like that. Please listen!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I raised my voice to address everyone. It was the first time I had garnered so much attention, so my voice trembled slightly, but now was not the time to be concerned about that.</p>



<p>“Yukina-san and I aren’t like that! Actually, I’m a YouTuber named Kei!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh, Kei-kun!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Upon my coming out, Yuki turned around with a surprised expression.</p>



<p>But without paying much attention to that, I continued, “So, please don’t misunderstand.”</p>



<p>“…Who’s Kei?” (Student)</p>



<p>“I don’t know?” (Student)</p>



<p>“He said something about being a YouTuber…” (Student)</p>



<p>Initially, my classmates’ reactions were dull. However, eventually—</p>



<p>“Oh, I know! Isn’t he the one Yuki mentioned in her livestream yesterday!?” (Student)</p>



<p>“I think heard about it too. The channel that Yuki was complimenting, right?” (Student)</p>



<p>“Ah, so that’s him.” (Student)</p>



<p>Such reactions started emerging, and gradually, the information began to spread.</p>



<p>“…Is it okay to tell everyone like this? What if it causes trouble for you, Kei-kun?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Yuki looked at me anxiously, but I was more concerned about Yuki being misunderstood as having a boyfriend. If I have a choice to help Yuki, there’s no doubt about which is more important.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun, what if your face gets exposed? And um, what if there are stalkers!? If that happens, I’ll do my best to protect you!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“What are you worrying about!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but retort to Yuki, who was breathing heavily.</p>



<p>…Does she realize she’s like a top idol? She should really hold back a little. Her airheadness is cute, but a bit too much to handle!</p>



<p>“Um, so does that mean that Yuki knew that Amamiya-kun is the YouTuber Kei, and you two went somewhere to talk about it?” (Girl)</p>



<p>When the representative girl summarized it that way, Yuki glanced at me briefly and then nodded.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right.” (Yukina)</p>



<p>With that answer, the atmosphere in the classroom immediately relaxed.</p>



<p>…Phew, it looks like we managed to avoid any misunderstandings. That’s a relief.</p>



<p>“Actually, this morning, when I went to the classroom early, Kei-kun was playing LoF by himself. So, I peeked in and saw he was really good! I recognized his play, and when I listened closely, I noticed his voice matched Kei-kun’s! Moreover, the character and weapon he was using were exactly the same! That’s when I realized that Amamiya-kun is Kei-kun, and it surprised me! I never thought Kei-kun would be so close, so I’m happy…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>However, in the next moment, as Yuki began to speak excitedly, the atmosphere became chaotic once again.</p>



<p>Since the truth was out, Yuki probably felt like she no longer needed to hold back anymore, and everything in her mind just burst out at once.</p>



<p>“H-Hey! We get it, we get it, so calm down a bit, Yuki!” (Girl)</p>



<p>Even though her friends were trying to calm her down, Yuki’s enthusiasm couldn’t be stopped.</p>



<p>Her demeanor was exactly like what I had seen on the rooftop earlier, like an otaku passionately talking about the greatness of their oshi and trying to spread the word. It was completely different from her usual cool and aloof appearance.</p>



<p>The impact seemed to be significant, and voices from the classroom were heard, mainly from the girls.</p>



<p>“Wow… I’ve never seen Yuki like that before.” (Student)</p>



<p>“She’s seriously into Amamiya-kun.” (Student)</p>



<p>“I’m kind of interested now too.” (Student)</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m going to go check out the channel later.” (Student)</p>



<p>On the other hand, the boys had a completely different take.</p>



<p>“Oi, Amamiya!” (Student)</p>



<p>“Damn it, he’s getting so much attention from Yuki” (Student)</p>



<p>“Unfair! Who cares about being a content creator!” (Student)</p>



<p>“If it’s LoF, compete with me right now!” (Student)</p>



<p>Some of them approached with a dark aura, mixed with resentment.</p>



<p>“Well… I don’t really mind…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Honestly, it was a bit bothersome, but as someone who also understood the feelings of having Yuki as your oshi, I reluctantly accepted their challenge.</p>



<p>I launched LoF, set up a room, and started the match.</p>



<p>…It somehow turned into a 1v4 situation, but well, whatever…</p>



<p>And a few minutes later…</p>



<p>“…N-No way.” (Student)</p>



<p>“How did we lose in a 1v4…?” (Student)</p>



<p>“None of my shots hit!?” (Student)</p>



<p>“Is this what it takes to get Yuki’s attention…? Ugh.” (Student)</p>



<p>The four guys were lying on their desks with a phone in hand.</p>



<p>…They looked like they had fun.</p>



<p>“Wow, that was amazing. A perfect win.” (Student)</p>



<p>“That movement was something else?” (Student)</p>



<p>“You really are good.” (Student)</p>



<p>“…He looked kinda cool for a moment there.” (Student)</p>



<p>The surrounding students who had been watching also began sharing their impressions of the match.</p>



<p>…It seems like they’re impressed, but honestly, it’s more about these guys being too weak than me being particularly skilled. If they charge in without checking their line of sight, of course, I’ll shoot them.</p>



<p>“See? See? He’s good, right? It’s really Kei-kun, isn’t it? Ehehe!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Why is Yuki so proud?” (Student)</p>



<p>Despite her friends teasing her, Yuki proudly puffed out her chest.</p>



<p>“Well, there aren’t many people who can beat Kei-kun! After all, Kei-kun climbed from Bronze to Grandmaster in just seven hours, thirty-nine minutes, and fifty-seven seconds in the last season! Fufu~!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Why are you acting so proud!? And why do you know the exact time!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Because I watched the live stream, and I’ve rewatched the archives many times!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>…Seriously, that’s pretty detailed. I didn’t even keep track of time that accurately. And down to the seconds…</p>



<p>As Yuki continued boasting about me as if she were talking about herself, I felt a strange sensation, something ticklish and awkward.</p>



<p>“Uh, um, Kei-kun…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>While contemplating such feelings, Yuki’s voice unexpectedly reached my ears again, causing me to jolt.</p>



<p>“W-What…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Feeling flustered by her faint breath and sweet scent, Yuki continued with a hint of hesitation.</p>



<p>“…Um, there’s actually something I want to ask you, is that okay?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Blushing and fidgeting, her words carried an incredible charm, and I genuinely thought my brain might give out by the sheer cuteness of the act.</p>



<p>“…Actually, I recorded the match earlier. Can I keep it…?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Suddenly hearing something unexpected, I couldn’t quite catch up with what was said, and my voice came out in a deflated manner. Yuki blushed even more and continued.</p>



<p> “I want to keep all of Kei-kun’s achievements…! It’s no different than when I backed up all of your streams! If I don’t save this here, it’ll disappear…! Oh, and, of course, I’ll give you something as a thank you! I can even send you a video of me singing your favorite song…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“A-A video of Yuki singing a cover?!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>What’s with this super rare offer!? I mean, as a fan, this is more than just a reward!</p>



<p>But seriously, I can’t just accept that! I really want to see it though…!</p>



<p>“Um, I know this might not be enough as a thank-you, but…! Is it okay…!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>She pleaded desperately, seemingly not realizing that the negotiation was far too favorable for me, and honestly, I was left speechless.</p>



<p>…Isn’t she a bit too cute…?</p>



<p>At that moment, I felt a strong realization that I was being supported by Yuki.</p>



<p>Ever since yesterday’s events, I understood it in my head, but it just didn’t feel real.</p>



<p>But seeing Yuki like this now, I finally had to acknowledge from the bottom of my heart that I was being supported by my oshi. It’s real.</p>



<p>…Oh no, this is bad. My heart feels like it’s about to burst…!</p>



<p>“…Hey, is it no good? It’s a commemorative match after meeting Kei-kun in real life, and, um, you looked really cool…! A-And, I promise I won’t let it leak…!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Staring at me in silence, Yuki, seeming to have misunderstood something, frantically pleaded with both hands fluttering. So precious…</p>



<p>“…Um, yeah, it’s fine.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Really!? Thank you, Kei-kun!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>As I nodded, Yuki beamed with a radiant smile.</p>



<p>While gazing at that exquisite smile, I could only think of two things.</p>



<p>The first was that I would continue to support Yuki for the rest of my life, and the second…</p>



<p>My oshi is absolutely, unquestionably, undeniably, the most amazing and adorable girl ever!</p>



<p>…Oh, by the way, I politely declined the offer for Yuki’s cover.</p>



<p>☆</p>



<p>[Yukina’s PoV]</p>



<p>“─And that’s what happened! Karin-chan, are you listening!?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“…I’m listening, I’m listening, so calm down a bit, Nozomi…” (Karin)</p>



<p>That evening, I was chatting with Karin-chan at the agency.</p>



<p>Of course, the topic was meeting Kei-kun in real life today.</p>



<p>The excitement from that moment still burned in my chest, and it showed no signs of fading.</p>



<p>I was so happy that I couldn’t wait to share the story with my best friend.</p>



<p>“─And then, Kei-kun quickly took down all four of them! I knew Kei-kun was strong, but seeing it in real life was so cool!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“…Hey, Nozomi, you might not have noticed, but you’ve already told that story five times?” (Karin)</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s only the fifth time. Then, I need to tell it five more times!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Don’t casually respond like that! Even if it’s a joke, it’s genuinely scary!” (Karin)</p>



<p>As Karin-chan stepped back while saying this, I chuckled.</p>



<p>By the way, I didn’t mean it as a joke at all.</p>



<p>“Ah, Nozomi, I get that you’re happy to meet your oshi in real life, but aren’t you getting a bit too excited? I’ve never seen you like this before.” (Karin)</p>



<p>“But I was really happy, you know? Because it’s Kei-kun? I met the real Kei-kun! It’s so exciting that it feels like the world is about to end!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Hold back a little! …Honestly, I’m glad that you’re happy, Nozomi” (Karin)</p>



<p>Saying that, Karin-chan sighed and shrugged with a wry smile.</p>



<p>Despite everything, Karin-chan is a good girl for listening to my story.</p>



<p>“…So, how was it?” (Karin)</p>



<p>“How was what?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“The real-life Kei-kun. What’s your oshi like in real life? You mentioned he’s your classmate, but…” (Karin)</p>



<p>“He was exactly the same as on his streams. Handsome, kind, and his real voice was just amazing! Oh, just remembering it makes my ears happy…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Can you not get lost in your thoughts in the middle of a conversation!?” (Karin)</p>



<p>Ignoring Karin-chan’s comment, I recalled the events at school.</p>



<p>A lucky encounter by reaching school early…</p>



<p>I never would have imagined that Kei-kun was my classmate. We had never talked before, so I had no idea. But the fact that such a thing happened feels beyond fate; it’s truly incredible.</p>



<p>I was so happy, so thrilled, desperately trying to convey my feelings…</p>



<p>Looking back, I realize I was quite a handful.</p>



<p>Dragging him to the rooftop forcibly, it wouldn’t have been surprising if he got angry.</p>



<p>Moreover, hearing a classmate suddenly say, “I’m your fan!”—that’s something bound to confuse anyone. Yet, Kei-kun accepted me, even with all the trouble I caused.</p>



<p>I remember Kei-kun’s slightly troubled yet infinitely gentle smile.</p>



<p>Just remembering that smile being directed to me fills my head with happiness.</p>



<p>Oh, come to think of it, when I heard that Kei-kun is also a fan of mine, I was so happy that I ended up crying too…</p>



<p>Honestly, looking back now, I have shown a really embarrassing side of myself. Still, Kei-kun gently accepted it, but, ugh~!</p>



<p>“…<em>Haa</em>~ So precious. My oshi is so precious it hurts…” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Good grief, whatever. It’s about time you come back.” (Karin)</p>



<p>A clap on my ear brought me back to reality.</p>



<p> “<em>Fue</em>?” (Yukina)</p>



<p>Then, with an exasperated expression, Karin-chan shook her head once again.</p>



<p>“You really like that Kei-kun, huh, Nozomi? Well, it’s fine, but the way you were acting earlier didn’t seem very idol-like.” (Karin)</p>



<p>While she said that with a teasing smile, I confidently responded.</p>



<p>“Being an idol or not doesn’t matter when it comes to supporting your oshi. I like what I like.”</p>



<p>Yes, there’s no need to consider your position when supporting someone.</p>



<p>I support them because I want to. That’s all that matters, in my opinion.</p>



<p>“…Being supported this much by a top idol, that Kei-kun must be happy. I kinda want to meet the real Kei-kun now. I’d like to see for myself what kind of guy Nozomi supports so passionately.” (Karin)</p>



<p>“Oh, Karin-chan, have you finally realized Kei-kun’s charm? Then, let’s watch Kei-kun’s archive together from now on! We can support Kei-kun together!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“I-I said I just want to see him in real life…” (Karin)</p>



<p>While Karin-chan was saying something, I ignored her and started searching for Kei-kun’s saved livestream archives on my phone. </p>



<p>As I was deciding which one to watch, my eyes were drawn to the most recent file.</p>



<p>It was the recording of the match with the boys from the class this morning.</p>



<p>A special archive that no one else except me has, the first video of the real Kei-kun…</p>



<p>…The moment I remembered that this video was special, my cheeks felt a sudden warmth.</p>



<p>At the same time, I felt a stronger desire to support Kei-kun deep within my heart. I’ve already been supporting him all this time, but now, I want to do so even more. An irresistible urge surged within me.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>~ Kei-kun, ehehe!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“Seriously though… It’s fine if you want to support him, but we’re idols, so be careful about that kind of thing, okay? If it causes a controversy or something…” (Karin)</p>



<p>“Hey, look, Karin-chan! I recommend this video that was uploaded yesterday! I watched the live stream, and it was really interesting… Oh, and this archive here is also worth checking out!” (Yukina)</p>



<p>“I didn’t ask, though…” (Karin)</p>



<p>Despite Karin-chan sighing with a somewhat annoyed expression, I was determined to share my oshi’s good side, eagerly thrusting my smartphone towards her.</p>
