<h2>Epilogue</h2>



<p> <br />The day after the incident.<br /> <br />“Hello, Saito.”<br /> <br />“Hi, Lily.”<br /> <br />Even though it was a school day, Lily and Saito didn’t come across each other until after lunch,<br /> <br />as Lily had been re-questioned about yesterday’s events at the police station.<br /> <br />“I’m glad Haruki is okay!”<br /> <br />“We were really worried! Seriously.”<br /> <br />“Whoa!? Hey, you two, that’s too tight! My bones are creaking!”<br /> <br />Lily, placing her bag down, looked at Haruki, who had come to school with them. He was being tightly embraced by his childhood friend Mizuki and senior Koyuki, screaming in discomfort.<br /> <br />“Hehe.”<br /> <br />“Want to join them? You were saved too, right?”<br /> <br />Seeing Lily laugh at her ex-boyfriend’s suffering, Saito, who was behind her, grinned and asked if she wanted to join in with the teasing.<br /> <br />The reason he said that was probably due to the rumors he heard on the way to school.<br /> <br />While Lily had resolved the incident yesterday, the time she spent restraining Makabe was brief, and a teacher took over midway.<br /> <br />As a result, few knew that Lily had repelled Makabe.<br /> <br />As a result, various speculations circulated. Due to Lily’s delicate physique and the fact that Haruki helped Koyuki, and Mizuki when they were about to be hit by a car or drowning, rumors spread that Haruki defeated Makabe. The rumor also suggested that Lily joined the harem because she was saved by Haruki. However, these were all false speculations.<br /> <br />If it were her first life, these rumors would certainly have some truth to them, albeit with slight variations.<br /> <br />After the events concluded, in previous life Lily was indeed a part of the circle with Haruki, Mizuki, and Koyuki.<br /> <br />Before the time leap, without a doubt, she would have been one of the main heroines in Haruki’s harem.<br /> <br />“There’s no way that could happen. Because—”<br /> <br />She dismissed Saito’s mischievous joke with an exasperated tone, knowing it was impossible.<br /> <br />But this time was different.<br /> <br />Lily had solved the incident on her own, and Haruki had not helped her at all. There was no romantic interest whatsoever.<br /> <br />Moreover, Lily knew Haruki was a scumbag who would cheat on her, so he was never going to be a romantic interest.<br /> <br />Joining Haruki’s harem was out of the question.<br /> <br />Above all, there was someone else Lily had met—<br /> <br />a person she genuinely wanted to become the main heroine for.<br /> <br />Meeting that wonderful childhood friend who vividly painted the once gray world with colors happened a few years ago.<br /> <br />“─I’m Saito’s childhood friend. There’s no way I’d leave Saito behind.”<br /> <br />With a beaming smile, she said, and Saito widened his eyes, eventually laughing with a look of disbelief. “You’re an idiot. With that attitude, you’ll never get a boyfriend for your whole life.”</p>
