<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>“Alright, eat as much as you want today. It’s all on me.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It was the day after Yuki returned from her legendary live performance.</p>



<p>It was a holiday, and I was at the sweets café where Serika usually frequents, along with the usual three.</p>



<p>“…You’ll get fat if you eat that much. Do you like chubby girls, onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh? Is that so!? S-Sorry, then! I’ll have a large serving of cake with extra whipped cream!” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika reacts to Sana’s words. That’s not even an order you usually make. Is this place a ramen shop or something?</p>



<p>“No, it’s just that you girls keep throwing around crazy amounts of money, so I’m trying to repay you somehow! When I offered to pay you back in cash, you said you wouldn’t accept it so I didn’t know how to do it…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I said bitterly, pressing my temples.</p>



<p>Yes, today’s gathering was all about refunding that hefty Superchat I received the other day.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no way I can easily accept such a large amount of money from them.  Especially, Sana, she’s my little sister, and I can’t just let such extravagant spending slide as her older brother. So naturally, I thought about returning it, but these guys just won’t budge…</p>



<p>“I’ve said multiple times already, that there’s no reason for a refund since it’s a fair evaluation for our oshi.” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…It’s natural to support your oshi with money.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Alright, Sana, we’ll put off re-educating your sense of money for now… But if you’re serious about it, then I’m determined to refund it, no matter what…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>This all-you-can-eat sweets buffet is just the beginning. After this, I’ll be getting them various gifts. I’ll definitely return the full amount…!</p>



<p>“Ehehe, ehehehe…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As I passionately obsessed over things that didn’t make much sense, I heard a playful laughter. When I turned around, there was Yuki, enjoying her parfait, with a face so happy it could melt at any moment.</p>



<p>…Well, even with a bit of cream smeared on her cheek, she looked incredibly cute. But she’s been like this since we met, and honestly, it’s been a bit difficult to talk to her like this…</p>



<p>“You’ve been acting like that for a while now, did something happen?” (Serika)</p>



<p>Serika asked the obvious question and Yuki giggled in response.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s thanks to Kei-kun during my live performance.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh? What about Ketaro?” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>I stiffened at Yuki’s words. S-Surely, she wouldn’t bring up that topic, right? I mean, it’s kind of embarrassing…</p>



<p>But seemingly oblivious to my concerns, Yuki happily recounted my words during the livestream and how they had encouraged her. She looked so blissful.</p>



<p>“W-What!? I did feel something was off there, but…!” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Sending a private message to just one person, you’re not fit to be a streamer. Favoritism…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>“N-No, there were reasons for that…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>But my excuses were not accepted, and both Serika and Sana continued to accuse me of favoritism. …Argh, I can’t argue back this time because it’s true…!</p>



<p>“…Kei-kun, Kei-kun.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As I was being cornered by the two of them, Yuki whispered in a cheerful voice, seemingly oblivious to the situation.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun’s message reached me loud and clear. I was so happy… I’ve never felt as blessed as I did when you supported me back then…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As if reminiscing about that moment, Yuki’s voice was filled with bliss.</p>



<p>“I want to be a source of strength for Kei-kun too. I want him to feel and know the same thing I felt. So…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>──Can I continue to support Kei-kun?</p>



<p>Upon hearing those words, I couldn’t help but turn to Yuki.</p>



<p>She had the most radiant smile I had ever seen, and it was so precious──</p>



<p>“…Thank you.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Before I knew it, those words had slipped from my lips in response.</p>



<p>“Ah, come on! What are you two whispering about?! ” (Serika)</p>



<p>“…Unfair, unfair, unfair, unfair!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Without even a moment to bask in that afterglow, Serika and Sana started getting more heated up.</p>



<p>“Ah, s-sorry! I just felt even more inclined to support Kei-kun than before, so I…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Apologizing while inadvertently adding fuel to the fire, Yuki… Oh well, the situation is getting out of hand.</p>



<p>As expected, the three of them began arguing about ‘who supports Kei the most’ just like always. Once it gets to this point, there’s no stopping them.</p>



<p>Fortunately, to onlookers, it probably just looked like girls having a lively chat, but given that the topic is about me, it feels like being pinned under a spotlight.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I can’t help but feel grateful for being supported by everyone.</p>



<p>Yuki, my oshi idol who loves my live commentary streams to the point of being obsessive, and who serves as a pillar of support for me.</p>



<p>Mariel-sama, aka Serika, my oshi VTuber, who appreciates my commentary despite being my childhood friend.</p>



<p>Sana, my little sister, who supports my streaming activities as a brother while I support her cosplay activities, forming a family bond of mutual support.</p>



<p>I never knew there were so many different ways to support someone until now.</p>



<p>As I watch the three of them argue animatedly, I wonder if I’ll continue to discover new aspects of what it means to support someone in the future.</p>
