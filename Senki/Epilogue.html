<h2>Final Interlude: Online Gaming Couple’s Chat Log</h2>



<p> <br />“Lies… Those were all lies. Lies, lies, lies!” Kurotsuki Kanade was shouting.<br /> <br />Two days after the conflict request battle was settled. My injuries had recovered enough to walk around. Thanks to Ishino’s rapid healing but…well, let’s put that aside for now. I immediately called Kurotsuki to “my classroom” and—<br /> <br />“Hah!? Lies, lies, shut up already you noisy fly!”<br /> <br />“Th-This isn’t Kurashiki-san!!”<br /> <br />Seeing Kurashiki’s transformation, Kurotsuki screamed. Hey now, I made sure the room was perfectly soundproofed, but try not to yell too loudly. It’s kinda worrying.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-san! Is this really Kurashiki-san!?”<br /> <br />“…Unfortunately it is. Also, stop adding ‘-san’ to my name.”<br /> <br />For some reason, Kurotsuki had started calling me “Amamori-san.”<br /> <br />I didn’t ask why, but he probably developed a “Amamori &gt; Kurotsuki ” mentality inside after seeing my power displayed. It feels kinda awkward considering he doesn’t actually know me, but whatever.<br /> <br />“Whaddya mean ‘unfortunately,’ I’ll punch ya, Amamori!”<br /> <br />“That’s way too cruel… You’d be more convinced if I said her insides got switched with Netsuhara’s right?”<br /> <br />“Alright, Kurotsuki -kun stand right there while I beat you a bit!”<br /> <br />Kurashiki stood up with a cute smile and cracked her knuckles. Kurotsuki looked ready to face her head-on, but that’d be unwise. She’s probably just as strong as you.<br /> <br />“Now now, both of you calm down. Kurashiki, stop getting heated up.”<br /> <br />“Ehhh!? But Kurotsuki -kun called me ‘Netsuhara inside’! I gotta beat that out of him!”<br /> <br />“Once committee chair, always a committee chair.”<br /> <br />At my words, alter-ego Kurashiki casually sat back down. Kurotsuki went “hieee” seeing her.<br /> <br />I turned to him and explained why I called him here.<br /> <br />“So, Kurotsuki . I want you to join the ‘organization’ I’m making.”<br /> <br />“I’d be glad to! Anything for Amamori-san!”<br /> <br />“…Answering immediately huh. Well, whatever.”<br /> <br />Why is he so obedient? It’s a little worrying, but his eyes are sparkling innocently so he probably doesn’t have ill intent.<br /> <br />“So what’re we specifically gonna do? You said support Asahina, but after that decisive loss, getting her fully back on her feet will take more time right?”<br /> <br />“That’s not an issue. I don’t want Asahina resolutely determined over vague reasons either.”<br /> <br />“…? So we’re doing something centered around Asahina-san?”<br /> <br />In response to his question, I started explaining to Kurotsuki .<br /> <br />How we’re seeking freedom. Dissatisfaction with the current school system. Moving overtly and covertly to take down the school itself.<br /> <br />The overt side driven by the unaware Asahina Kasumi. The covert side controlled entirely by [us].<br /> <br />“And in order to manipulate Asahina as we want, what’s necessary is…”<br /> <br />“Kurashiki-san who can stand by Asahina-san’s side and lead everyone together, and me to pass Amamori-san’s plans directly to Asahina-san as a strategist. Is that right?”<br /> <br />Damn, this kid’s understanding is too fast!<br /> <br />“Amamori-san is a monster, putting it mildly. If you want to move Asahina-san, it’d be better for Amamori-san to join as strategist directly… No. The fact you’re not doing that means you must have a reason.”<br /> <br />“…Amamori-san, could it be you’re also wary of someone?”<br /> <br />“Oh, oh, that’s what I was curious about too!”<br /> <br />Somehow he saw right through me despite me not saying anything.<br /> <br />“You said not directly joining as strategist was so you could move freely right? Means there’s someone you’re cautious of.”<br /> <br />“…Did I say that?”<br /> <br />I don’t really remember saying it, but… yeah, there is someone. In this school where I thought no one knew me, the sole person from my hometown I found. A childhood acquaintance. The woman who knows my past.<br /> <br />“Well…there’s one in Class A.”<br /> <br />“Class A…? But wasn’t their leader…”<br /> <br />Netsuhara Nagashi. Anyone would think that at first glance.<br /> <br />But the reality is likely very different.<br /> <br />“Don’t tell me there’s a bastard dancing Netsuhara around in his palm…”<br /> <br />I nodded at Kurashiki’s words. I was surprised when he appeared grabbing Netsuhara’s hair during the battle.<br /> <br />“I mean, what was that guy doing? Did he really show his true feelings back then? I felt like I was giving him a really cold look at that moment. It was the first time I’d ever seen such a farce.”<br /> <br />“…Well, let’s put that guy aside for now. He’s starting to sound like he might actually show up if we keep talking about him.”<br /> <br />So, let’s get back to the serious stuff.<br /> <br />“Enough of that. Kurotsuki, I want you to cooperate with Kurashiki and guide Asahina. Be the behind-the-scenes expert supporting Asahina. You may not appear in the open often, but you need to be a force with equal power and influence as Asahina.”<br /> <br />“Understood! With ‘Demon Lord’s Blessing,’ I can use ‘Telepathy,’ so I’ll do my best while consulting with Amamori-san!”<br /> <br />“Anything goes with ‘Demon Lord’s Blessing’…”<br /> <br />Saying this, I smiled and clenched my fist.<br /> <br />I extended my fist to both of them.<br /> <br />There’s still a lot to think about. Unexpected things will surely happen in the future.<br /> <br />But it’s our job to anticipate and overcome everything.<br /> <br />“Our immediate goal is to unite the first-year students. Crush the troublemakers in Class A, and Class B.”<br /> <br />It’s quite regrettable, but we’ll have to put off dismantling the school for now.<br /> <br />First, we need to sweep away the troublemakers among the first-year students. Once the unrest is gone… that’s when we’ll crush the school.<br /> <br />Otherwise, we’ll probably get swept away while fighting against the school.<br /> <br />Class A, Class B, and Class C of the first-year students.<br /> <br />If we’ve distributed our forces evenly among these classes, there will undoubtedly be students in each class at or even above Asahina’s level. Ignoring them would be a considerable obstacle.<br /> <br />“For now, our main job is to support Asahina Kasumi. I won’t ask for anything difficult, just give it your all to make sure she doesn’t ‘lose.'”<br /> <br />Kasumi Asahina is a defender of justice. In contrast, Class A and Class B harbor evil.<br /> <br />I don’t know the extent of their power, but as long as they’re evil, Asahina will undoubtedly react. Even without us doing anything, we’ll develop hostile relationships with both classes.<br /> <br />Your job is simply to ensure that “Kasumi Asahina wins” when that time comes.<br /> <br />How’s that? Pretty straightforward, right?<br /> <br />“…Geez, you’re not making it easy from the start.”<br /> <br />“I’ll take care of it! I’ll do my absolute best to complete any mission you give me!”<br /> <br />In response to my words, Kurashiki, Kurotsuki, and I each extended our fists.<br /> <br />Lurking in the shadows, controlling things from behind the scenes.<br /> <br />If Asahina is the sun — the “day” face — then we have to be the shadows — the “night” face.<br /> <br />Yeah, “night” face… “Night,” huh?<br /> <br />In that case, let’s name our organization like this.<br /> <br />“Organization name: ‘Yaen.’ the Night Banquet. From here on, we will destroy this school.”<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto, Kurashiki Hotaru, Kurotsuki Kanade.<br /> <br />Let’s start with these three.<br /> <br />A life-threatening survival game against the school.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…Seriously, can’t we come up with a less chuunibyou-sounding name?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Noisy.<br /> <br />But we’re still high school freshmen.<br /> <br />Preferring darkness to light, and the shadows to the spotlight.<br /> <br />At this age, it’s natural to admire such things.<br /> </p>

<h2>Afterword<h2>

<p><br />Hello everyone, nice to meet you, or hi again. I am Aizawa Tateru.<br /> <br />First, thank you very much for picking up this work.<br /> <br />This was originally a personal piece only meant for my own viewing – something I never thought would see the light of day. This story is one such work I wrote down assuming it would remain unseen eternally.<br /> <br />Yet through a convoluted series of events, I started posting it online, and now we’ve arrived at the present.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto – who is he? This work that will unravel his mysteries.<br /> <br />You must never forget – Amamori Yuuto is a liar.<br /> <br />He spouts lies without a change in expression, paying no heed to dialogue or narration.<br /> <br />I think there aren’t many protagonists you can trust less.<br /> <br />However, the awful thing about him is that he does speak truth at times.<br /> <br />Discerning what is true and what is a lie will be an ongoing task with him, so I hope you can enjoy unraveling that as you read.<br /> <br />Once again, thank you for picking up this work.</p>
