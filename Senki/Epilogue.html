<h1 class="entry-title">Epilogue &#8211; Omen</h1>

<p>Tilia was visiting her mother ― Empress Astrea who had been bedridden for a long time because of her ailing health ― in her private quarters situated in Castle Justia. In spite of her daughter&#8217;s sick visit, the empress was gazing at the landscape outside.</p>
<p>But, this was the usual. In fact, by now it was so close to a custom that Tilia had stopped feeling hurt by it.</p>
<p>Tilia hated Castle Justia. Because this castle, which lay half a day&#8217;s ride from Alfirk, had been designed with livability as its main focus, its capabilities as a fortress were negligible. A hundred elites of the First Imperial Knight Order were stationed here, but in case of an enemy attack, this place would likely fall within half a day.</p>
<p>Even the fact of the castle having been erected smack down in the middle of a plain with nothing around it, on top of its lacking defenses, seemed to be proof of Ramaru the Fifth&#8217;s ― Tilia&#8217;s father ― low affection towards her mother, making it even harder for her to come to like this place.</p>
<p>Then again, where not coming to like something was concerned, she also couldn&#8217;t stomach her mother always gazing out of the window. After all, it made her mother look as if she was waiting for her father.</p>
<p>However, her father&#8217;s love had long shifted towards Chief Court Lady Farna.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;How about we try holding a ball?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have a fiancé, do you? That&#8217;s why I thought it might be a good idea to hold a ball,&#8221; Tilia&#8217;s mother answered her daughter&#8217;s question with a sigh.</p>
<p>Yet, her mother was right in Tilia having no fiancé. Her father wasn&#8217;t overly eager in finding one for her, and Tilia herself didn&#8217;t harbor any interest in marriage either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been considering something like a marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, someday you&#8217;ll have to marry and give birth to children. Just like His Majesty and I did. Or, do you already have a gentleman of interest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t!&#8221; Tilia raised her voice faintly.</p>
<p>For some reason, Chrono crossed her mind, but she immediately rejected the idea by telling herself that it was impossible as Chrono was no more than a friend to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if it comes to organizing it from now on――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You just need to have Farna help you with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>If Tilia were to be honest, she didn&#8217;t feel like borrowing the help of the evil wench who had stolen her father from her mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m well aware that you hate her, but that girl is quite useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I understand. If you go this far, I&#8217;ll oblige, Mother,&#8221; Tilia consented.</p>
<p>But, at the same time she wondered how many influential nobles would attend if she sent out invitations from now on.</p>
<p><em>Leonhart of the First Imperial Knight Order should show up if he&#8217;s got nothing else planned, but I feel like expecting anyone else to come will be in vain. No</em>, Tilia shook her head lightly, <em>there&#8217;s one more person I can think of. Earl Rio Cheyron of the Ninth Imperial Knight Order. If it&#8217;s him, he&#8217;ll probably attend, even if he has to cancel prior engagements. Not because he loves to participate in balls, but for the sake of crushing the event itself. I have to clearly tell Farna to not send an invitation to that guy.</em></p>
<p>Having thought up to that point, she suddenly remembered Chrono.</p>
<p><em>Since we&#8217;re talking about Chrono here, he&#8217;ll likely turn it down, claiming that he&#8217;s busy with his work as a lord, but since he&#8217;s my friend, I should probably invite him anyway.</em></p>
