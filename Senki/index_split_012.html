	<p class="block_2">“Casey, take care of it over there.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Luilui, cover me.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Big sister, get back. You’re too far forward.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I gulp as I watch this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The orcs are moving like an organized army. They’re not trying to push through with their raw power, but rather skillfully trying to corner us. Each orc covers the other, and they make sure to not take fatal damage.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“This isn’t good, we have to go help.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Talia is starting to get nervous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s been over ten minutes since the battle started. We try to go help, but the orcs move to block us. Again, they move like a single being, with no hesitation, and no openings for us to attack.</p>

	<p class="block_2">At this rate, our side is going to run out of steam first. The difference in stamina between the monsters and the girls is very apparent.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We were lucky that surprise attack went so well, or they would have crushed us by now.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The way they move leads me to feel that way, and not having Yor and Trisha with us may have been a miscalculation.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Should I try to create an opening? How? If I fire magic, that one with the shield will probably just block it. How about area of effect magic? Should I focus less on how powerful it is, and only on distracting them?</p>

	<p class="block_2">The highest level magic I can use are fire and earth. Can I catch them off guard if I use both?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Leila, I’ll cover you with magic.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I let out a short scream and kneed magic. Fire in my right hand, and earth in my left hand. I can do this thanks to Parallel Thinking.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t need it to be powerful, it just needs to make them flinch.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look at Hikari, and she moves out while suppressing her presence.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’m going.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Fire storm. Stone Shower.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I chant in my head, and the magic activates.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Fire Storm hits the orcs on the right side, and Stone Shower on the left.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The sudden magic attack takes the orcs by surprise. Some are hit directly, but still don’t really receive any damage. They laugh mockingly at this magic that was really just for show, but that quickly stops.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It only takes a moment for Hikari to jump out from a blind spot and slash an orc, and then another. Of course, neither attack did much visible damage.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila and Casey also don’t miss this chance, and cut down two orcs with coordinated attacks.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Luilui’s arrow is blocked, but it stops an orc that was going to attack Leila and Casey.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Two orcs are down, and two others are moving increasingly slower.</p>

	<p class="block_2">This means the balance of power that was holding us back is destroyed, and we keep up the momentum. One goes down, then two more, and finally, there is only one orc left. This one couldn’t fully dodge a slash, and is now gushing blood and breathing heavily.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s gravely wounded, but Leila and the others are still careful, and surround it to finish it. It looks like the orc has come to terms with its fate, as it throws away its shield and yells louder than any of the orcs did before. The ground shakes, and the sound reverberates throughout the entire cave.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The orc charges forward, as if being pushed by the sound, but the reckless charge is stopped by Leila’s sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She dodges the orc’s attack, and decapitates it as she passes by it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It’s over.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">We managed to take them down, but it was a tough fight. Leila, Casey, and Luilui are all breathing heavily.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I approach the three, who look like they’re going to fall at any moment, pass by them, and as I approach the passage on the other side, I swing my sword as hard as I can.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But even though I put all my strength into this attack, it’s easily blocked. My target looks surprised to be attacked right after it showed up, but quickly responds.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I take a big jump back before the attack can hit me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Have you ever fought one of those?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I ask Leila, who looks surprised.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m sure the others have the same look on their faces.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I have.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What are our chances?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t get an answer. I feel like she’s holding something back, as she glares at the enemy in front of us.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Name – (Lloyd ) / Job – (…) / Race – Orclord / Level – (85)</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s a pretty high level, and this pressure is no joke either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But… Yes, but…</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m not despairing.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t feel the same way I did when I met Ignis.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Not that it’s not strong, it did easily block that attack. I don’t expect to be able to take it down either, I’m more focused on getting through this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Leila, I’ll hold it off while you and the others escape.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That won’t do. You can’t do it alone.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“I don’t think having more people is really going to help against that,”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Casey.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, big sister.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I will stay as well. You take command from here on.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Casey doesn’t know how to respond. She probably knows how strong the orclord is. She would usually follow Leila’s instructions without questioning them, but she’s at a loss as to what to do.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Please. I am counting on you too, Tali and Luilui.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">In the end, Casey relents, and goes to the captured women. They talk about something, probably about the two that are left.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But after Casey insists with a strong tone of voice, the women run towards the exit. Of course, with Casey and the others.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, I’ll stay and fight too.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You go too, Hikari.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But…”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“There’s a lot to get in the way. And I’ll feel better if you’re with them. Also, you know how strong I am, don’t you?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Yes. Be careful.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">The orclord looks interested as it listens to us talk.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Thank you for waiting.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I say to Lloyd.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Kukuku, the result is the same. Trampling you and hunting the others is more fun.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I actually get a response.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’ve heard that some superior species can talk, and these monsters are pretty intelligent.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So, how do we fight that thing?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I ask the person that actually has experience fighting something like that, as we face Lloyd.</p>
