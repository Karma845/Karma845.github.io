<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>Love is inefficient and unnecessary emotion.</p>

<p>That was the philosophy I realized.</p>

<p>...Well, I may sound pretentious, but for example, let's say you confess your feelings to a classmate you have crush on.</p>

<p>They'll likely reject you with hesitance, &quot;Um, I'm sorry.&quot; right? Just because you developed feelings for someone who doesn't think much of you, why should you be the one getting hurt?</p>

<p>So in the end it's all about a risk management issue. The act of falling in love with someone comes with its own risks and complications.</p>

<p>Especially those with a dark personality and no social skills, commonly referred to as &quot;introverts,&quot; should be on high alert. Due to their lack of popularity with girls, they always ended up in unreasonable love story, only to be tormented, suffer, and ultimately betrayed. Well, I understand it well because I'm the same.</p>

<p>In other words, falling in-love is the most foolish thing in this world.</p>

<p>Instead of craving for desire, we will just wait for other girls to truly fall in-love with us and f*ck you all saying, &quot;we can't have girlfriend because we're not popular.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm quite confident that my opinion is not entirely wrong. (I'm serious)</p>

<p>As the ancients say, love is something you fall into. Well, as the saying goes, people mistakenly fall in love. If you let yourself be controlled by such instinctive emotions, an unhappy ending will eventually come to you.</p>

<p>Therefore, I want the guy who have come to terms with the fact that they won't be liked by the opposite sex to hold their heads high. Because they are the ones who possess wisdom and a seemingly enlightened way of thinking more than anyone else.</p>

<p>Because love is not something you do, but something that happens to you.</p>

<p>...Yep, That's right.</p>



<p>You see, no matter how far this explanation goes, this is just all about story of a certain girl's journey through love. And I, Tokami Riku, is deeply involved in it.</p>

<p>That's the explanation why I made such an introduction.</p>
