<h1 class="calibre1">Prologue: Twinflower</h1>


<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre4"></strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">If there’s a moment when you fall in love, then surely there’s a moment when you fall into friendship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For me, that moment was during the cultural festival in my second year of junior high school.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">For a rural junior high school, our cultural festival was famously crowded. Each club partnered with local farmers and restaurants to set up exhibitions and food stalls. Every year, a large number of students from other schools and guests would attend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Science Club presented a “Flower Arrangement Exhibition.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">In collaboration with a major florist in town, we were selling small goods aimed at women made from fresh flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the first day of the two-day cultural festival, it was just a little before 4 PM, I&nbsp;was wandering around the school, holding a case of accessories.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-we’re from the Science Club. We’re selling flower accessories&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, that live performance by Senpai at noon was awesome&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah! I missed it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I was completely ignored.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, I know, my voice was too soft to be heard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was getting anxious because we were far from meeting our sales quota.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, an hour before the end of the first day, I thought of walking around the school to sell our goods. …The problem was that I couldn’t promote anything by just wandering around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Could a guy with no friends muster the courage to speak to strangers at the last minute?</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I was lost in thought, a couple interested in the accessories approached.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s this? Real flowers? Wow, they’re beautiful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, these are preserved flower accessories. The profits will be donated to a volunteer organization…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Preserved flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">These are fresh flowers treated with chemicals like ethanol to make them last longer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s said that those processed by experts can remain fresh for a year or even two.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what we had turned into accessories for sale.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, you can actually make these? How much?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The boy picked up one of the earrings from the display.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, they seemed willing to make a purchase, so I eagerly told them the price.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“One piece is 500 yen!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh, that’s expensive! Never mind then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He abruptly refused to buy it and roughly put the accessory back into the case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It was then that I realized for the first time how difficult sales could be.</p>

<p class="calibre5">500 yen is no small sum for a junior high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They might use it for a meal at McDonald’s, but it’s not an amount they’d casually spend on a classmate’s handmade accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the end, I sold only five pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Five out of a hundred, after spending the entire day.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(One more day left… No way, it’s impossible.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Holding the accessory case, which I had foolishly overstocked, I returned to the science room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had pale skin and a slender figure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her almond-shaped eyes were a translucent shade of marine blue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her flowing, beautiful hair had a slight wave and was a bit light in color.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looked ethereal, like a beautiful girl from a fairy-tale.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was alone in the empty science room, intently examining the flower accessories I’d prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Surrounded by the colorful flowers for display, her presence stood out even more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had placed one of the headbands on her head. It was adorned with three round flower buds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Looking into the tabletop mirror, she muttered, “Heh, It’s like there’s a flower garden inside my head. Cute,” and chuckled to herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: A flower garden inside the head is similar to saying someone has “their head in the clouds” in English. Somewhat silly or absentminded or airheaded.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Picture-perfect.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought so.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If this were Instagram, I would hit “like” a hundred times without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, you can’t actually like something a hundred times.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was pondering such silly thoughts, she turned around.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, you’re finally back. You’re Yuu Natsume from the Science Club, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was startled to hear my name called out of the blue.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To me, she was a complete stranger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Beautiful women really do have beautiful voices,’ such a trivial thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, that’s right…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was a bit nervous in my response since I didn’t know whether she was an upperclassman or an underclassman.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why doesn’t this school differentiate grades by the color of their embroidery or something?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You shouldn’t leave your store unattended. A little while ago, some girls with flyers came to look.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I messed up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m the only one in the Science Club. Of course, I have no one else to take care of the store.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If this was the case, I lose my chance to sell anything…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Never mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari asked, looking puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My ego was already in tatters, too damaged to openly express my frustration.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It wouldn’t have sold anyway. It makes no difference whether I’m here or not.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari was holding a carton of juice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was Yoguruppe, something I used to drink a lot in elementary school. She continued as she took a sip through the straw.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s actually did sell well, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A weird voice escaped my lips. It was almost a shriek.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Was she teasing me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it didn’t feel like that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean…? I mean, I wasn’t even here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, don’t worry, I got the money. I held onto it for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s Yoguruppe made a slurping sound. She neatly folded the empty carton and put it in her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her refined manners seemed particularly ingrained.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she took out a brown envelope and handed it to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here, it’s for fifteen people.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I opened it in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One thousand, two thousand, three thousand… 11,500 yen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wow…I’ve never seen this much money, except maybe as a New Year’s gift.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait, hold on. This is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, 15 people bought a total of 27 items.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The calculation is…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The calculation is off?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I nodded quickly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not off. Let’s see, Yuririn bought earrings and hairpins, Mappi bought a book cover and a bookmark, and Azumi Senpai bought about three.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She listed the purchase history, chuckling as she went along.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did people really buy multiple items?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even 500 yen is quite a lot of pocket money for a junior high schooler, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="calibre5">But indeed, the items she mentioned are gone…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why all of a sudden?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d been working my tail off all day and only sold five items.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, 27 items sold in just the one hour I was gone?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Is my face that off-putting?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t have a lot of confidence, but this really hurts.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She suddenly leaned in close.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so surprised that my heart almost stopped as she looked at me head-on.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…In any case, she was a beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had no makeup, but something about her demeanor oozed a good upbringing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even her hair that swayed as she bent down was silky smooth.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was like watching the famous weeping cherry blossoms in Kyoto sway in the wind… Well, I myself don’t think this is a good metaphor.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for me, flowers are the closest thing I can relate to.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun, why aren’t you looking at me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, no reason…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I averted my eyes. I’m not good with beautiful people.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, before that, about the reward for watching the store…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s fine, really. I was bored anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not the point…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm. Well then, I’ll ask you one thing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari went straight to the point.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why do you have to sell 100 items?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, how do you know that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Science Department’s Sato Sensei mentioned it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What about my privacy…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That old man, is it because a beautiful girl is involved?</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was racking my brain, Himari leaned in close again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even when I looked away, she moved to meet my gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, why?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a stunningly beautiful smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It felt like she was saying, “Come on, just confess because this adorable me is asking.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sure, she’s cute, but her silent pressure is terrifying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Honestly, I don’t want to say it. Because I’ll probably be made fun of again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But… these 27 items are huge.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“My dream is to open a store like this that sells flower accessories. I told my parents that I wanted to find a job to save money after graduating from junior high school. But they want me to go to high school to become a civil servant. So, the condition they set is if I can sell 100 of my handmade accessories during the cultural festival, I can do what I want…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Huh, silence?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari blinked her large eyes, her face unreadable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wait a minute. You can’t just make me confess something so embarrassing and have no reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’d understand if you were put off, but if that’s the case, just say so…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Pffhaha!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari suddenly burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahahaha! Of course! If a kid came up with such a reckless life plan, any normal parent would stop them. That’s crazier than aiming to be a trend-setting shop clerk! (カリスマショップ店員)”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What had appeared to be a calm and beautiful girl was now laughing so hard she was clutching her stomach. Her cool demeanor shattered in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I felt overwhelmed but in a different way… However, even such actions seemed elegant to her, and I found that kind of unfair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still giggling, Himari wiped away her tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re stupid.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sh-shut up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re really stupid. So stupid.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite being so casually insulted by a girl I had just met, I didn’t really feel uncomfortable, and no, not because I’m a masochistic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I realized that even this level of familiarity felt comfortable coming from this girl named Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How many of these accessories do you have left?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari asked out of the blue.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, to reach 100, I still have 68 left…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that all?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“These are preserved flowers, so they’re fragile, right? You’ve prepared some spares, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I do have 50 spares, actually…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, 118 left, huh? Well, I guess I can handle that much.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I didn’t understand the meaning behind her muttering.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Be prepared to sell them all tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari said that, waved her hand, and left the science lab.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alone in the science lab, I was left dumbfounded.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">…And then, the next day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was just past 4 PM on the second day of the cultural festival.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At precisely the same time as I had met Himari the day before, I was slumped over a desk in the science lab, completely drained.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the table stood a single placard.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Flower Accessories: Sold Out”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Despite my initial enthusiasm, I had never dreamed that I would have to use this sign yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not a single one of the display accessories that had adorned this science lab remained. My stock was completely empty.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I hadn’t even had time to sell outside like yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Today, I have been entirely occupied with taking payments.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I hadn’t even had lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Although I was hungry, I had no energy to go buy anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Why did they suddenly sell out…!?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t just sales to students.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The second day was a Sunday, and there were visitors from outside the school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Those had sold especially well, particularly to female college students from a nearby welfare university.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When these adult ‘Onee-sans’ wore them while walking around the campus, they caught attention, and then classmates who heard rumors came to the science lab.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When these students performed in bands or plays, even more eyes were on them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a result, everything was sold out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! Even my share is gone!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I looked up at the noisy voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari was staring at the empty display case with a stunned expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She started shaking me vigorously as I lay slumped over the table.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, where is it? That yellow one!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I had a lot of ‘yellow ones,’ so…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a choker! The one with bubbles in it, remember?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…A choker with bubbles?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I recalled it. From the box of stock, I took out the last flower accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It had delicate white petals with yellow stamens.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was Twinflower.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A perennial plant that grows in the fields and mountains. It’s named for the two flowers that grow on a single stem.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This wasn’t something I had cultivated from seed; it bloomed on its own.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took the preserved flower and enclosed it in a diamond shape using a transparent liquid called resin, then I set the amber-like creation into a choker.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, this was a failure. A large number of bubbles had gotten into the resin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Honestly, it was not appropriate to sell, but I had displayed it solely as a sample because it looked good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing it, Himari’s eyes lit up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I’m glad! I forgot to buy it yesterday!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s a failure, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why-why!? It’s super cute!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-If you say so, I’ll give it to you. But I wasn’t planning to charge for a failure…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really!? Natsume-kun, you’re so kind!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost jumped when she suddenly hugged me from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That seriously startled me. Her sense of personal space is wild.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m really glad I helped out. Truly lucky.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Helped out? Did you do something to make them sell out?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe. Who knows?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Satisfied, Himari took it and immediately put it around her neck.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It looked perfect on her refreshing appearance. In fact, I thought the bubbles actually complemented her ethereal image.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a kind of chemical reaction…Even a failure could shine this much, depending on who wore it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was genuinely impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, my admiration vanished with Himari’s next bombshell.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve actually had my eye on this choker for a while. I was watching you the whole time you were pouring resin in the science lab, Natsume-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? From where…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“From the window in the hallway. You didn’t notice at all, did you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t notice…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I even tried to get your attention.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I got ignored though. I never thought you wouldn’t even recognize me until yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had no recollection of it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve always been told that when I focus on something, I become oblivious to my surroundings, but I never thought a fellow student had observed me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, should we go?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? Where?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Himari smiled brightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To our celebration party ♡”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I later found out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This girl named Himari was extraordinarily famous among our classmates.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『The Bewitching Woman, Himari Inuzuka』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Popular with boys, girls, upperclassmen, underclassmen, and even teachers. She seemed to manipulate everyone as if rolling them in the palm of her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her family lineage was also rather prestigious. Her family has been major landowners since the Taisho era.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her grandfather is a former member of parliament, and Her father is an active diplomat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her two older brothers, who are much older, are an up-and-coming local politician and a fast-rising civil servant, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Last night, a very popular reader model apparently featured this flower accessory on Twitter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On top of that, they mentioned it was being sold at this cultural festival.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That reader model happens to be a classmate of Himari’s brother, which is why a bunch of university girls came to visit.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At the Mos Burger, where we stopped to celebrate&mdash;or more like to thank her&mdash;I was taken aback looking at her account boasting a staggering number of followers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There were many purchase reports on Twitter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Questions like “Where can I buy this?” were frequent. I was getting worried about my privacy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not amazing, really. I’m just good at asking for favors, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, Himari was smiling casually.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The smile was so natural that I couldn’t bring myself to feel antipathy toward her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why did you help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Taking a sip of her shake, Himari said something strange.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I didn’t help you. After all, I’m not sympathizing with you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari continued while checking Twitter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I just wanted to sell this, that’s why I asked Onii-chan. I didn’t sell it because I felt sorry for you, Natsume-kun. You shouldn’t get the words wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was someone who would say that kind of thing nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, her eyes shining, she said something outrageous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s do it&mdash;a specialty store for flower accessories. I’ll help too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What is she talking about?</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I gave her that look, she said somewhat proudly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You see, I’ve always been able to do anything. Good at studying, good at sports, and cute. I have high social skills, and people love me, and I’m also cute!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Inuzuka-san, you intentionally said ‘cute’ twice, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s a problem if she smiles at me like that as if asking for my agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sorry, but I’m not the type who can promptly respond with something like ‘Yes, you’re the cutest in the world.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But all I’m doing is just borrowing the strength of others, you see. That’s why I admire someone like Natsume-kun, who works so hard.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you even know about me…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her eyes sparkled brilliantly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She began to speak as if she had been waiting for this question.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I know that since the gardening club disbanded, you’ve been taking care of the flowers in the neglected backyard garden every day, Natsume-kun. Those accessories, you made them from scratch, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Furthermore, Himari continued to expose my embarrassing history.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I also know that you’ve named all the flowers. When preparing for the cultural festival, you were cutting them one by one while sobbing.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-you saw that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Also, high points for talking to the flowers while watering them. ‘You look cute today,’ ‘You guys are my only partners,’ ‘I’ll love you even when we’re apart,’ Why do such cool lines come out when you’re talking to flowers?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why don’t you just kill me already…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I writhed in agony, Himari burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I initially intended to just buy the accessories, but things seemed more miserable than I thought. So, I impulsively used my ‘once-in-a-lifetime request’ on Onii-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A once-in-a-lifetime request…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, a very important one.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She looked at me again, her eyes tilted upward in that charming way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, I’d like you to take responsibility, Natsume-kun, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her words felt like a heavy punch to my gut.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I know what would have happened if I didn’t have her help…that’s obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All I can see is myself sitting in front of a mountain of unsold stock.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean by ‘responsibility,’?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She placed her index finger on her chin and tilted her head adorably.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, with a smile that was almost blinding, she declared,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Can I have those eyes?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A shiver ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing me accidentally crush the hamburger in my hand, Himari added with suppressed laughter,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not like I have a splatter fetish, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I get it, but that’s not really the point…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari scooped up the teriyaki sauce that had leaked from my hamburger bag with a french fry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she popped it into her mouth without hesitation, she said,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume-kun, you may not show it on your face, but your reactions are big. That’s really a high point.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was unclear whether she was praising or mocking me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After eating that, she took a sip from her shake’s straw. The teriyaki sauce on her lips mixed with the white shake, and for some reason, it struck me as slightly sensual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unaware of such thoughts, Himari said earnestly,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I like the look in your eyes when you’re making floral accessories, Natsume-kun. They shine brightly with passion. They’re so straightforward and beautiful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“My eyes…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The sound of Himari’s shake slurping came through the straw.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Gripping the straw playfully, she chuckled, “Fufu.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, how about you show those passionate eyes only to me? Let me have them all to myself? Then, I’ll sell as many of your accessories as you want&mdash;&mdash;Should we become that kind of fated partners?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I nodded slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, what Himari was saying didn’t quite resonate with me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason I accepted her offer wasn’t because her fancy words moved me… rather, it was more because I was terrified of what she might do if I refused.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I was surprised to find myself thinking that I wanted to be friends with Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s because for the first time in my life, I had met someone who saw value in me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She had clearly said she liked the only passion I had, one that had never been understood even by my family.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The choker around her neck seemed to assert its pressence as it shined.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The flower language of twinflowers is “friendship,” “cooperation,” and “never to part.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And I had a feeling that such twinflowers would surely make dependable and cool companions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To me, Himari felt like twinflowers manifesting in human form. It would be strange if I didn’t fall for her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As my heart was racing in solitude, Himari muttered, “Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, the atmosphere suddenly shifted. Or rather, it reverted to its original state.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The serious atmosphere from moments ago disappeared, and she put on the frivolous smile I had seen in the science room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Of course, there’s no romantic feelings involved. It’s just too much trouble, you know? Love is like a poison that destroys everything. So it’s a no-go for us.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The conversation suddenly shifted from the poetic, emotional lines earlier to something much more mundane.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, I get what she’s saying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The notion that business and love should be separate is generally an important principle, I think.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, Natsume-kun, can you do it?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Under the table, she nudged my leg with her toes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, if a cute girl like Himari does this sort of thing naturally, most people would fall for her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It feels like the distance between us has gotten closer.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari happily propped her cheeks up with both hands, swaying her head from side to side. Her beautiful hair also swayed softly to the left and right.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Or maybe you’ve already fallen for me? Have you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Oh?’ Himari’s eyebrows were raised.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing that unexpected expression on her face, I realized maybe this my first opportunity to turn the tables.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m actually not good with beautiful girls. My sister and her friends are pretty good-looking and popular, but… I’ve been hearing about their terrible feelings toward their boyfriends. Rose-type girls are seriously scary.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She stared at me blankly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, unable to contain herself, she burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Pffthaha! Rose-type girls!? Nice. Yuu, you’re the best!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, she poked my nose with her finger and laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, I’d cleared the final “confirmation point.” …But, suddenly being called by my first name, Yuu, felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even without romantic feelings, being called by my first name by a girl all of a sudden is embarrassing to death.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If only all boys were like you, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, that’s impossible. A normal guy would’ve fallen in love at least three times by now, and probably confessed about five times.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why are the number of confessions higher!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Basically, with beautiful girl, they just, well, wanna do it… you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari happily snapped her fingers.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahh! I get it, I get it! I do get approached by people like that sometimes. They mainly exist among upperclassmen and underclassmen. But Yuu, if you’re embarrassed, you don’t have to say anything, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, Inuzuka-san, you’re clearly more on the sunny side. I was just wondering if it’s better to be in that kind of mood…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha, don’t worry about it. But seeing a stern-faced guy like you, Yuu, turning all red and saying that, I might actually like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Th-thanks, I guess…but we’re in a restaurant, so can we move on?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">If a guy like me were to say it, it’s one thing, but when a beautiful girl like Himari says it, the surrounding stares really hurt, so I’d appreciate some mercy here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…But still, what is this? This sense of security, as if I’m in front of an “ideal friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To be honest, I’ve been popular since before I even understood what romantic feelings are. So, I really don’t get it anymore. I even have this premonition that I might never experience love for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I guess I’m easily seen as a potential romantic partner, so I get confessed to a lot. That’s how my self-consciousness grew, thinking, ‘Oh, I’m popular.’ Probably why I’ve never had a first love.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s a problem I can’t relate to, but it sounds tough.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Have you ever had a girlfriend, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“With my kind of hobbies? No way. Ah, but there’s someone I like…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s eyes sparkled brilliantly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She leaned in, very keen to hear more.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you? Who is it? If I know her, should I set you up?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, absolutely impossible, really impossible. To begin with, I don’t even know where she is right now… She’s a girl I met on a trip back in elementary school.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So you’re a hopeless romantic, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Yeah, a hopeless romantic. Is that so wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…This could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari teases mercilessly at the other person’s weak points. But, surprisingly, there’s no malice in it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Due to this strange sense of security, as if we’ve been friends for years, I feel like I could confess just about anything.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, aren’t we so much alike, in a way? Yuu, you’re easier to talk to than I thought, it feels like destiny.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“D-Do we really resemble each other?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And it doesn’t seem like you’ll have a normal marriage either.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I did feel that way to some extent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari has a sensibility that’s too detached from the outside world, and I’m simply a flower fool.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems like we fit in with our classmates, but at the same time, we don’t.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If it’s said that it was fate for people like us to meet like this, it surprisingly felt just right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because Himari and I clicked from our very first meeting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu. If we’re both still single when we turn 30, why don’t you just live with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Leaving aside that sudden proposal, why 30?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s like a temporary limit? In any case, let’s focus on our goals and work hard until then, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Indeed, there needs to be a balance in things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If you’re staking your life, you must also consider preparations for backing out in case of failure.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Then, If you’re still single even after you’re 30, choose me, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari looked up at me with a suggestive glance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her fingers tapped on the empty shake cup.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Easily seeing the expectation lurking behind her gesture, I let out a small sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…living with Himari is definitely out of the question, because I prefer women who are more graceful. I’d seriously prefer not to have this vibe at home.”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_05.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">At that reply, Himari, as expected, burst out laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This might be the first time I’ve been turned down in my life!” she exclaimed, laughing so hard it seemed she was having difficulty breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t know what struck her funny bone, but it seemed I was slowly but surely understanding this girl’s taste.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, I fell into this friendship.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought I would spend my entire life as close friends with this girl named Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Little did I know that this dramatic and heartfelt conviction would shatter in just two years…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Really, life doesn’t always go the way you want it to.</p>
