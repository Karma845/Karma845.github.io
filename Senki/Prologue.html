<h2>Prologue: Online Gaming Couple&rsquo;s Chat Log</h2>


<p>“――I appreciate everything you’ve done for me.”</p>
<p>The black-haired boy lowered his head, his voice devoid of emotion. He was a high school freshman this year, with a stature and build befitting his age. His dark eyes peered from the tousled strands of hair.</p>
<p>At least from seeing him in his school uniform, there was no impression other than “normal.” However, if you were to pinpoint one distinctive feature about him…</p>
<p>“…That’s all well and good. But can’t you do something about that expression? Utterly emotionless, no matter what you talk about. Making friends would be quite a challenge with that demeanor.”</p>
<p>Since taking the boy in, there hadn’t been a single instance where he had seen the boy’s expression. His blue eyes, clouded like cheap marbles, revealed nothing.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to make such things. You know that, don’t you? You, too.”</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess that’s true.”</p>
<p>Having heard the man’s response, the boy bowed and began walking. He didn’t turn back to look at the man. There was no hesitation in his steps.</p>
<p>Watching his retreating figure were a tall man and a single attendant who accompanied him.</p>
<p>“Master, we don’t know the specifics… Is it really alright?”</p>
<p>“About harboring him… or perhaps supporting him so he can attend this academy. Either way, it’s not something you should be concerned about.”</p>
<p>Only the man knew the boy in this house. He had hidden him away, ensuring it stayed that way. Therefore, he didn’t even bother preparing a proper response to these inquiries.</p>
<p>“…Just who is that boy?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the attendant let out a question. Even for this inquiry, he had no intention of providing an answer.</p>
<p>Yet, as he gazed at the departing boy’s back, strangely enough, words formed in his mind.</p>
<p>He was the illegitimate heir of a lineage that had once devoured even gods, stronger and wiser than anyone else. Still, that boy would undoubtedly speak more truth than anyone else while deceiving.</p>
<p>“…Well, he’s just a liar, that’s all.”</p>
<p>That boy, in common parlance known as a ‘hero of justice,’ was the complete opposite—a mere monster.</p>
