<h1>Prologue: Online Gaming Couples Chat Log</h1>


<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Hey, you’re here! I knew Jet Black-kun would log in!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Of course, I was waiting for you, Mahorin!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> It’s the ‘<em>Isekai Homeroom</em>‘, right?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Absolutely! I was thinking of saving it for tomorrow, but I couldn’t resist chatting with you right away!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Me too! It was consistently interesting from the first episode, but the excitement in the final episode was extraordinary! The rendezvous with the students council president which leading to a joint effort was awesome!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Even the delinquent group undergoing a change of heart was so moving!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Totally! I cried when the teacher rushed in!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Right? Although I knew the plot, the roll call scene and such were so emotional! And at the very end, they dropped the bombshell, <em>‘Season 2 confirmed!’</em> I was so surprised; I made a weird noise, haha.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Me too, lol. Kotomi-san must have been screaming too.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>She was screaming a lot, lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>As expected! By the way, Jet Black-kun, what time are you planning to sleep tonight?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep for another hour.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Then, how about a call?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Heeey ~</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Sorry, sorry, I went to the bathroom! I’d love to share my thoughts with you over a call, but unfortunately, my phone seems to have disappeared. I think I can find it if I search, but who knows when that’ll happen! It’s not fair to keep you waiting until then, right? I think continuing our chat would be a more meaningful use of time. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Should I try calling and see if it rings?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Wait, wait!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Found it!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>That’s great. So, should we make a call?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Heeey ~</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Are you not in the mood for a call?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>No, no! I really want to call! But when I checked just now, Kotomi was already asleep! I’m sure if I talk to you on the phone, I’ll get all excited and start yelling, and then Kotomi will wake up!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Wasn’t she screaming a while ago?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Kotomi falls asleep easily!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I see. Then let’s stick to chatting for today! We can discuss our otaku activities another time!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Just the two of us?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Kotomi-san will join too!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Thanks! Kotomi will be thrilled! It’s fine if you girls want to chat alone, though!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I won’t leave you out, Jet Black-kun! Speaking of which, do you know that the campaign for ‘<em>Passionate Warrior Princess</em>‘ starts the day after tomorrow?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Of course. If you buy two ice creams at the convenience store, you get a clear file, right? They’re all cute, but the illustration with everyone together is especially amazing!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> I know! It was the one where they were eating ice cream on the bench in front of the convenience store! It’s so precious how Hot Blood-chan dropped her ice cream, and Bit Hot-chan is feeding her own ice cream, lol.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Exactly. Hot Blood-chan, Bit Hot-chan, Baby Hot-chan, and Devotee-chan<sup data-fn="7436e1da-e634-49ac-a306-7cea9d3290f8" class="fn"><a href="#7436e1da-e634-49ac-a306-7cea9d3290f8" id="7436e1da-e634-49ac-a306-7cea9d3290f8-link">1</a></sup>, they’re all so cute. I want to collect them all!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Stuff like that is hard to use outside, but somehow you end up wanting to complete the set!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Totally! But I’m kinda short on cash. Anyway, I’ll definitely get the one with everyone together, and the rest will need a discussion with my wallet. What about you, Mahorin?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>The only choice is completing the set. Especially, I must get BIt Hot-chan!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>You really like Bit Hot-chan lol</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I automatically like little sister characters. Plus, Bit Hot-chan has the same birthday as me!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Really? July 2nd is just two weeks away!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>That was quick response! You know Bit Hot-chan’s birthday?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I saw it at the recent art exhibition.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Ah, that makes sense. By the way, when’s your birthday, Jet Black-kun?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Same as MioMio from Driste!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>No way!? Lucky you. But it’s still a while away. You should call me senpai until then lol</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Mahorin-senpai, I have something to ask!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> What is it, kouhai?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>What kind of present would you like?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> A present, huh? Anime goods would be great. Are you getting me one?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Of course! I’ll prepare the best present!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Thanks! Then, I’ll look forward to it!</p>

<ol class="wp-block-footnotes"><li id="7436e1da-e634-49ac-a306-7cea9d3290f8">They do not have ‘furigana’ because they are adjective (We fell into a trap). The author shows ‘different’ kinds of hot. Such as, <strong>熱血</strong>, <strong>微熱</strong>, <strong>知恵熱</strong>, and <strong>熱愛</strong>. If you check closely they have one thing in common: <strong>熱</strong>. These phrases are super common in JP phrases, such as JP video games. <a href="#7436e1da-e634-49ac-a306-7cea9d3290f8-link">↩︎</a></li></ol>
