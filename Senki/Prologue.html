<h1>Prologue</h1>


<p id="no1">On the day of my long-awaited live performance at the famous <a href="#footnote">Nippon Budokan<sup>1</sup></a>, I found myself huddled alone in a corner of the dressing room.</p>



<p>The nervousness before the live performance still washed over me, unchanged even now.</p>



<p>No, when compared to when I first debuted, I feel much more nervous now.</p>



<p>I love singing, I love dancing, and because of that, my desire to deliver the best performance keeps getting stronger.</p>



<p>But still, how should I put it… it’s just that I’ve been feeling more anxious lately.</p>



<p>“It’s almost time…” (???)</p>



<p>While muttering in a quiet voice, I take out my smartphone from my bag.</p>



<p>At times like this, there’s only one coping mechanism for me.</p>



<p>“…Hehe.” (???)</p>



<p>A natural smile escapes, and I feel my heart lighten.</p>



<p id="no2">Watching videos of my ‘<a href="#footnote">oshi<sup>2</sup></a>‘ — just that alone envelops my mind in a fluffy happiness.</p>



<p>“Nozomi. It’s about time…ah, you’re in that corner again…” (???)</p>



<p>As I was engrossed in watching the video, the door to the dressing room opened, and my fellow group member, Karin-chan, walked in.</p>



<p>“You were watching videos again, huh? Nozomi, you really like that channel, don’t you?” (Karin)</p>



<p>As she approaches me, she peeks into my hands and laughs with an amused expression.</p>



<p>As I nod in agreement, Karin-chan sighs and shrugs with a wry smile.</p>



<p>“Is this person really your oshi? Despite having single-digit views, it’s hard to believe that it’s being endorsed by the top idol ‘Yuki’.” (Karin)</p>



<p>“Views don’t matter. If it’s good, it’s good.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Sorry, I’m not saying it’s bad or anything. By the way, what was it again? The name of that channel. I think it was something ‘game commentary’…” (Karin)</p>



<p>“<em>Mouu</em>, how many times have I told you, and you still don’t remember? It’s—” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I proudly declare, uttering the name of my beloved oshi.</p>



<p>At that moment, the anxieties that lingered within me until now had completely vanished.</p>
