<h3>Chapter 3: Mimori Yui and Tokami Riku Wants To Get Closer</h3>

<p>When I opened my locker, there was a bento inside.</p>

<p>It was weekday when I went on a date with Mimori. About a week had passed since that.</p>

<p>Mimori's request for me to eat the bento she made, she had started preparing small side dishes for me recently. I feel like it would be bad if someone saws her putting the bento in my shoe locker, but it's Mimori we're talking about. She's probably being careful.</p>

<p>There's sticky note attached onto the bento saying,</p>

<p>--Let's do our best again today too.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, I'll do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>And so, my day at school begins.</p>

<p>Though to be honest, it's not much different from any other day. If I had to mention something, I would be submitting the report on the recent recreation activity to Kurusu-san, it's officially required for committee activities after all.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to write it, but Kurusu-san advices me, &quot;Why not write it in your perspective, like a romantic story about Yui? Make it like a dream novel.&quot; Of course, I write the report in a safe and organize manner.</p>

<p>After school, as promised, I headed towards the disciplinary committee room. Then...</p>

<p>&quot;Tch...&quot;</p>

<p>The girl named Manaka was also in there clicking her tongue.</p>

<p>Why was Manaka...? I wonder what she wants to talk with Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>With a sense of curiosity, I entered the room, where Kurusu-san said,</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome back. I wonder if you've written a masterpiece that would make me feel embarrassed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've told you, I don't write romantic comedies... By the way the girl earlier, she's my classmate, Manaka right? Did something happen... Sorry for prying even though I'm an outsider.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. In a way, it's also concerns about you after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Manaka and me? The one in the light and the one in the shadow, two contrasting individuals?</p>

<p>... Expressing it like that, it sounds like an intense supernatural battle. In the midst of a false everyday life, it feels like we're fighting while carrying something we must protect. In reality, we're just an extrovert and an introvert.</p>

<p>&quot;There was a report saying that Manaka-san was bullying Yui. So, as the disciplinary committee chair, I was conducting an investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Bullying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Things like hiding belongings or such. It's a bit beyond harmless pranks, so I'm thinking of reporting it to the homeroom teacher.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but be stunned. I knew Mimori was disliked by those around her, but I never imagined she would also get harm.</p>

<p>&quot;But there's no need to worry since Manaka-san is the only student who would directly target Yui. If this kind of thing happened frequently, it would be a major problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, does Manaka have a grudge against Mimori? I heard that Mimori stole Manaka's boyfriend...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you believe that, Tokami-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. I can't say that every rumor is false, but that one is definitely baseless. Most likely, the story has been exaggerated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we reveal the truth, it will be Manaka-san's misunderstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san let out a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Manaka's boyfriend apparently made move on Yui, but she rejected him. Then Manaka found out about it and spread the lie that 'Mimori seduced her boyfriend.' In the end, the two of them broke up. Oh, by the way, it seems that the boyfriend transferred to another school. Well, it's only natural for him meet bad end since he did bad deed. Hehehe.&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes didn't show any signs of amusement! It must have really angered her...</p>

<p>But if Kurusu-san hadn't been angry, I think I would have lost control of my own anger. That boyfriend is obviously the worst, and Manaka is just holding a grudge against Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Yui has many enemies. That girl probably also want to live her life like any ordinary high school girl... As for this matter, I will take responsibility and handle it, so rest assured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. If you say so, Kurusu-san... But, may I ask one question?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san tilt her head and ask the question that's been on my mind since earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Kurusu-san, do you always conduct investigations like this, I mean the questioning students?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes. I am the disciplinary committee chair, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But bullying against students is not just a problem for disciplinary committee but for entire school, right? So, you shouldn't handling that issue on your own.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...? Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san tilts her head in genuine curiosity.</p>

<p>&quot;Students at Sakurazaki High School are being treated unfairly, right? Things like skirt length or untidy attire. I think protecting discipline is far more important than trivial matters like that.&quot;</p>

<p>I spoke the words as if it was the most natural thing. Then I noticed,</p>

<p>Perhaps Kurusu-san is even more talented than I had imagined.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> After school, holding a bag of donuts in my hand, I pressed the intercom at Mimori's apartment.</p>

<p>For no particular reason, I stopped by the Mister Donut near the station. It was just a simple reason, wondering if Mimori would be delighted if I bought her favorite &quot;Pon de Ring.&quot;</p>

<p>...I admit, I'm already completely charmed by Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p>

<p>However, no matter how long I waited, Mimori isn't coming out.</p>

<p>I tried calling her on my smartphone, but there was no response. I thought about waiting a little longer, but there was a possibility of being seen by classmates if I stayed here...</p>

<p>Reluctantly, I entered the entrance using the spare key to the apartment. Mimori gave me this key because we're lovers.</p>

<p>Reaching Mimori's room and surprisingly, the door was unlocked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's open...? Mimori, I'm coming in.&quot;</p>

<p>I entered the living room and was taken aback.</p>

<p>Neatly folded laundry was placed on the table. And on the sofa beside it, Mimori was lying down, peacefully asleep, breathing softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so she was sleeping. ...I guess she left the door unlocked so I could come in.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, what should I do?</p>

<p>It's probably better to wake her up, but Mimori must been tired after the work, she does. It must be quite challenging to handle household chores while going to school, so maybe I should leave her like this for a little while.</p>

<p>...However,</p>

<p>&quot;I know this is her own home, but there's a limit to being defenseless right...?&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori is currently dressed too casually.</p>

<p>The short shorts suit, exposing her fair and beautiful pure white thighs. The thin camisole exposes his shoulders, and above all, her voluptuous chest is so visible that you can see the lines.</p>

<p>To be honest, it's hard to know where to look.</p>

<p>While she's sleeping peacefully. I thought, this is even more awkward than the swimsuit.</p>

<p>I'm also a boy, so if a girl my age is in such an indecent state, I can't help but have inappropriate desires. I've been stealing glances since earlier, and maybe I should just stare at her...</p>

<p>...Wait a minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Could it be... she's just pretending to be asleep?&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, Mimori is currently watching my every move, and if I were to look at her with lecherous eyes, she would use that as excuses to tease me, right?</p>

<p>No, no, I'm being too paranoid. After all, she left the door unlocked for that purpose, and she's even pretendeding to fall asleep as if she dozed off. But the risk of me going home while still pretending to sleep&#9472;&#9472;</p>

<p>Yeah, Mimori is capable of doing something like that.</p>

<p>I've been teased in ways I couldn't even imagine before.</p>

<p>Wait, does that mean I should wake Mimori up right away? But there's also a possibility that she's actually asleep, so it would be bad if I'm mistaken... Ugh, why does a psychological battle have to happen just because Mimori is sleeping!</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey, Mimori? I brought back donuts from Mister Donut. If you don't wake up now, I'm going to eat them all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;*...soft breathing*&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there it is. If you're so defenseless like that, even I won't be able to resist.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;*...(soft breathing)*&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chikuwa Daimyojin&quot; (TL: Chikuwa Daimyojin or Chikuwa God is a god that is basically nobody, but in 2ch in 2008, he/she was mentioned and was asked &quot;who?&quot; Meaning the person who asked 'who?' doesn't know her, and it became meme or joke after that. This also happen to Mano Aloe, a Vtuber who got locked (twitter) at the beginning of her introduction as Vtuber and became 'nobody' as 5th gen.)</p>

<p>I thought she would at least laugh a little, but Mimori shows no sign of waking up.</p>

<p>...Who am I even fighting against?</p>

<p>Mimori is just sleeping, and I've been overthinking things for no reason. When I calm down and realize that, I feel a slight urge to die, so I decide to stop.</p>

<p>...But if Mimori is sleeping, maybe I should say one last thing.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey. I couldn't say this until now.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking in a serious tone, I utter these words while gazing at Mimori, who is peacefully breathing in sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori, you're the cutest in the world... Thank you for being with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Well, there's no way she would wake up from that.</p>

<p>Feeling foolish, I gently poke Mimori's cheek with my finger. It might be a bit much, but Mimori always toys with me. This is just a small payback.</p>

<p>I cover Mimori with the blanket I found in the living room. I guess it's okay to let her sleep for another 30 minutes or so. I take out my smartphone...</p>

<p>&quot;...Chikuwa Daimyojin&quot;</p>

<p>My phone slips from my hand.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that voice from behind, a chill runs down my spine. My instincts scream that I shouldn't look, but slowly, I turn around...</p>

<p>There, Mimori is faintly blushing, desperately trying to hold back a grin.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see... So, you thought of me that way, huh... Riku-kun, you've been thinking of me like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Nooooooo! She was pretending to be asleep the whole time! Wait, that means she heard everything about eating everything and not being able to resist, right? And that last word too...!?</p>

<p>&quot;I was just thinking of getting some attention from you, but it turned out to be an unexpected result. If I knew this would happen, I should have looked at your face properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I don't know what you're talking about! Right, I don't remember anything! Even though it happened just ten seconds ago, I don't remember a single thing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then let me remind you. You said, 'Mimori, you're the cutest in the world. Thank you for being with me. Please marry me,' didn't you?&quot;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00014.jpeg">

<p>&quot;I didn't say marriage though.... Ah!??&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I made a slip of the tongue, Mimori started smiling with a grin on her face.</p>

<p>I felt a warm sensation spreading throughout my body at that smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Kill me... Just kill me already...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? I'm so happy.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's cheeks loosened with a smirk.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the first time someone I love, called me cute... So, thank you for being with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, say it again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely not!!&quot;</p>

<p>I crossed my legs, trying to escape from Mimori's gaze.</p>

<p>Honestly, why did I even say something like that...? Trying to change the subject, I asked about something that had been on my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, I saw Manaka in disciplinary room with Kurusu-san. Did Manaka do something to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you knew about that. It's not a big deal, really. It's not something that happens often, like having things hidden from me. Are you worried about me, by any chance?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, yeah. Mimori, you don't have many friends at school right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, just relax. I'm fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori said those words like she was acting, but she's genuinely fine.</p>

<p>But is it because she's already used to other people's jealousy?</p>

<p>&quot;Manaka-san isn't a bad person, but she can be a bit emotional. I tried explaining that it's not what it happened... but since she knows about the rumors, it's no wonder she's not believing me.</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn't justify anything though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah. Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>I already understood that Mimori is a good person, so there's no need for someone to tell me now.</p>

<p>That's precisely why I hope Mimori can fit in at school. It feels completely wrong for her to be excluded. However, Mimori's bad reputation is already implanted in our school, and the one who refuses to deny those rumors is none other than Mimori herself.</p>

<p>Mimori is clearly keeping secrets, and she's keeping the reasons hidden from everyone.</p>

<p>Perhaps I don't know anything about Mimori after all.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, speaking of which, Riku-kun, did you stop by Mister Donut?... Wow. They have all the flavors of Pon de Rings. Um, is this heaven?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's heaven since you can buy it with just one coin.&quot;</p>

<p>I chuckled at Mimori, who had a sparkle in eyes. As expected, I don't want things to stay like this.</p>

<p>I want to know more about Mimori.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever felt this strongly about someone before though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three days later, returning to the school after weekend, the usual lunchbox is in my locker.</p>

<p>I'm starting to get used to it, but when I think about it, she went through a lot of effort of making it... I packed it in my bag, feeling grateful in my heart, and headed to the classroom.</p>

<p>It's a bit late to say this, but I don't have anyone close enough to greet me. Without anyone noticing me, I usually continue chatting with my few friends... or so I thought.... The moment I entered the room, which is usually filled with noise, suddenly fell in silent.</p>

<p>&quot;............?&quot;</p>

<p>What's this strange feeling?</p>

<p>The sensation of the entire class staring at me. This feeling is something I didn't like. Curiosity from the boys and disgust from the girls.</p>

<p>If I were to put it forcefully, this atmosphere... is similar to when rumors spread through the class after witnessing a conversation between me and Mimori.</p>

<p>I got a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p>&quot;Takahashi-kun, I'm sorry but, Can I talk to you now?&quot;</p>

<p>I called out to Takahashi-kun, who was preparing for the first period at his desk. However, despite the sweat on his forehead, he didn't even attempt to meet my gaze. It was blatant rejection.</p>

<p>But since there was no one else to ask, I couldn't easily back down. I stared at him silently, applying pressure... and then, with a sigh, Takahashi-kun conceded.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Tokami. I told you, right? That you shouldn't involve with Mimori. I know we're practically strangers, I intended to give you a friendly warning, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Takahashi-kun operated his smartphone and showed me something.</p>

<p>It was a chat screen from a messaging app. Most likely, it was the class group chat that Takahashi-kun mentioned before.</p>

<p>And among the messages, one person was sending an image... and I was left speechless.</p>

<p>The image showed none other than myself.</p>

<p>It captured me leaving Mimori's apartment through the entrance.</p>

<p>Multiple students were causing a commotion through messages about the photo.</p>

<p>And the majority of those messages were full of insults directed at both me and Mimori.</p>

<p>[This is Mimori's apartment, right? I remember it being a trend in our school recently.]</p>

<p>[For real? So that means Mimori and that guy did it, huh?]</p>

<p>[Tokami-kun is always quiet in the classroom, right? ...What a disappointment.]</p>

<p>Something is off&mdash;this is definitely wrong.</p>

<p>If it were just a coincidence to spot me, there's no way the photo would turn out this clear. It would require confirming my entry into the apartment, waiting in hiding for hours until I came out, and then taking the shot. It takes that level of planning to achieve this.</p>

<p>I sense malice in this photo. It's a clear intention to trap me and Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... So this is Mimori's apartment?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't you know, Tokami?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, no... I have a friend who lives here too. I've been visiting quite often lately. Oh wow, seriously? People have been saying things like this about me?&quot;</p>

<p>However, Takahashi-kun's expression of disbelief remains unchanged.</p>

<p>It seems my feeble excuse won't work.</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, your reputation is at worst. The girls look down on you, and the guys don't want to be associated with you to avoid being viewed negatively.&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, I see. Perhaps Takahashi-kun ignored me earlier because he didn't want others to see us talking.</p>

<p>Well, I don't blame Takahashi-kun for his reaction. I understand how he feels.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Sorry about that. Thanks for telling me though.&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I took my seat, I reported that to Mimori via my phone that the trend photo earlier is circulating among the students. Her reply came quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;Understood. I'll check on it here too. Did you mention to anyone that you know me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I kept it a secret. Though I don't think anyone would believe it anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's fine. It's best if our relationship isn't discovered. Even if they think it's a desperate lie, I want you to stick to the story that you didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly after, I received another message from Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop coming to my place from now on. We need to be thorough in avoiding any suspicion about our relationship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Even if it means leaving the lunchbox behind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can deal with that later.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>From then on, I tried to maintain a calm demeanor as much as possible. The students around me were clearly gossiping about me, making it an uneasy day.</p>

<p>After the closing ceremony, without hesitation, I headed to the disciplinary room. I made arrangements with Kurusu-san in advance to meet there.</p>

<p>&quot;It's become quite a situation. How does it feel to be a victim of paparazzi for the first time in your life?&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu-san wore her usual confident smile, but her fingers tapped the desk in a busy manner.</p>

<p>Kurusu-san is feeling flustered.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. It's all because of my carelessness that such a photo was taken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No need to apologize. There's no way to be on guard against something like this. That photo, the focus was as accurate as a professional journalist's work. They must have targeted you, Tokami-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems Kurusu-san had the same thought as me.</p>

<p>&quot;Also, we've identified the student who took this photo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? Already? That was quick.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a big deal. I used the authority of the disciplinary committee to check your class's group chat. The one who took that photo is Manaka-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>I knew that Manaka had a grudge against Mimori, but I never expected her to go as far as taking photos.</p>

<p>However, something about it doesn't sit right with me.</p>

<p>&quot;But I have a question regarding Manaka's involvement. How did she find out that I was visiting Mimori's apartment? I was careful everytime I went to see her, and if she were tailing me from the station, I would have noticed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no wonder that you notice that. But it wasn't Manaka-san herself who discovered that you are going in Yui's apartment, but all the students at this school.&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;......What?&quot;</p>

<p> &quot;When you connect all of these little rumors together, like a puzzle, you will end up with a single speculation.&quot;</p>

<p>Kurusu's sharp eyes, like Japanese swords.</p>

<p>&quot;The rumors are actually &quot;A boy from Sakurazaki High School going in Yui's apartment&quot;. When you put this rumors, you will end up with a new rumor that there is a student from Sakurazaki High School who visits Mimori's apartment during the evening and at night.&quot;</p>

<p>I was horrified by Kurusu-san's explanation.</p>

<p>The students have a web of information that is as thick as a spider's web. The most popular and most trouble maker in the school cannot be able to escape from this.</p>

<p>It was as if she was being watched by every student.</p>

<p>&quot;Manaka-san who was first to catch the rumors, had always wanted a proof that Yui was having promiscuous intercourse. Well, that's impossible, of course. Because Yui has never done anything like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean that's why ...... she was so eager to get the evidence this time around?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. The fact that finding evidence is actually really hard than you might think. But when she heard that a high school boy that is actually you, got it more easily trend.&quot; Kurusu breathes a sigh of tiredness. &quot;I don't think those pictures will prove that Yui was having promiscuous intercourse...... but it created a bigger problem for you, Tokami-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>That is to say, our relationship that we've desperately hidden all this time has now been exposed to those around us.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine, really. I was a loner to begin with, so I don't have anyone to worry about disliking me now.&quot;</p>

<p>I meant it as a joke, but Kurusu-san's expression remained cloudy.</p>

<p>&quot;Just to be clear, Tokami-kun... Do you regret becoming Yui's boyfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You already know the answer to that.&quot;</p>

<p>Without hesitation, without a hint of hesitation, I looked at Kurusu-san and stated clearly:</p>

<p>&quot;If I were to regret it, I wouldn't have started dating her in the first place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's true.&quot;</p>

<p>For the first time since this situation spread out, Kurusu-san had a gentle expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;If you ever need someone to talk to or if there's something I can help with, I'm here for you. I can offer advice or lend an ear to your complaints. After all, there's hardly anyone else you can talk to about Yui-related matters, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for relying on you so much, Kurusu-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, really. I told you that before, didn't I?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Kurusu-san smiled softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I see myself as the cupid of Yui and Tokami's love... I've always been rooting for a happy ending for the two of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... Are you seriously like that role?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but burst into laughter.</p>

<p>Somehow, I felt like I laughed for the first time today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three days had passed.</p>

<p>With just that, the reactions around me had clearly changed.</p>

<p>For example, when I passed by other students, their expressions seemed kinda tense. And during P.E. class, there were no students willing to partner with me.</p>

<p>In particular, Manaka's treatment with me is obvious. Before I knew it, she was glaring at me, and even the girls who were close to her had also become cold towards me. It feels like the sense of disgust towards me was spreading, because of Manaka.</p>

<p>I wonder if Mimori feels the same way.</p>

<p>Above all, the most significant change was that I hadn't seen Mimori since that day. She'd made a throughout effort to hide our relationship and even avoided contacting me through our phones. It made sense to wait until things calms down, and I had no objections to that.</p>

<p>...Well, If I said I'm not lonely, that would be a lie.</p>

<p>If there's one opportunity to catch a glimpse of Mimori, it would be now. After school, from the hallway, looking at the courtyard...</p>

<p>Oh, there she is.</p>

<p>I muttered inwardly as I spotted Mimori crossing the courtyard.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I would catch a glimpse of Mimori from the window in the hallway like this. Since I hadn't seen her for a while, I would feel a slight happiness when I happened to spot her like this.</p>

<p>However, even if I feel happy to see Mimori, at the same time, it would remind me how I miss her.</p>

<p>I can't even call out to her or wave my hand.</p>

<p>Ah, forget it. It's getting gloomy. I turned around, intending to leave... and I was startled.</p>

<p>There was a female student, Suzune, frozen in place, staring at me from a close distance.</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, you scared me. Suzune, what are you doing...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, well... I was thinking about what to do next. Since I've already done things like tapping someone's shoulder and poke it's cheeks when he looks, I was wondering how to get your attention, Senpai...&quot;</p>

<p>What's with that obsession?</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Senpai, do you have a moment? I'd like to talk to you about something.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune's expression seemed somewhat anxious. That alone gave me a hint.</p>

<p>Suzune must know about that photo.</p>

<p>&quot;...No, I'll pass. If I go along with you, I might cause trouble.&quot;</p>

<p>With just a glance, I looked at a few female students gathered in the corner of the hallway.</p>

<p>They were conversing while looking at me. I couldn't understand the content of their conversation, but from the bits and pieces of words I caught, it didn't seem like a pleasant discussion.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, because I have a bad reputation now. Even if you're concerned about me--&quot;</p>

<p>Just as I was about to continue speaking, I felt a tight, soft sensation in my right arm.</p>

<p>Suzune was already clinging to my arm and started walking.</p>

<p>&quot;S-Suzune...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Senpai, you're worrying too much.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't see what expression Suzune had as she walked ahead. However, her voice carried an unusual seriousness.</p>

<p>&quot;You shouldn't distance yourself from me over something like this. How many years do you think I've been your Kouhai?&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune's unwavering words left me speechless for a moment.</p>

<p>She led me to the courtyard and we sat down on a bench.</p>

<p>&quot;That photo has become a topic in my class too. They're saying we should be careful around that pickup artist; Tokami. ...Senpai, are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a big deal, really. I was always a loner to begin with.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't mention that I was even more disliked by girls in middle school... I couldn't joke about that with Suzune, no matter what.</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune, what do you think of me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I think something happened between you and Mimori-san. Considering what happened recently, it's hard to believe that it's unrelated to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Do you despise me?&quot;</p>

<p>However, Suzune remained silent... and eventually, she murmured:</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, it was Father's Day the other day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, it was.&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, she's suddenly bringing up that topic here?</p>

<p>Though, I'm pretty curious about Father's Day gift. But I've been feeling down lately, so a cheerful topic is quite welcome.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember that you decided to make homemade sweets for your father. How did it go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dad cried. He said it was the best gift he ever received. As his daughter, it was a little embarrassing, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can understand your dad's feelings. If I received homemade sweets from my adorable daughter, I'd be moved as well.... I'm pretty jealous on your dad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really...? Well, I'm glad then.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune rummaged in her bag, then gently placed something on my lap.</p>

<p>It was a carefully wrapped butter cookie.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a surprise present... handmade by me.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Suzune's cheeks slightly blush, I was taken back.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you before, right? Even though I failed last time, I'll come up with something that will really surprise you next time,&quot; Suzune said.</p>

<p>Come to think of it...</p>

<p>On the day we first searched for a Father's Day gift, she mentioned something like that when we parted ways.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...? Really!?&quot;</p>

<p>Because this is unexpected, I unintentionally stood up, holding Suzune's cookie in my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;W-well, it certainly surprised me a lot! But... a gift, for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You helped me study for the entrance exams, and you've always been there for me. While looking for a gift for my dad, I also researched about what you'd like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come to think of it, you did ask for my opinion a lot while choosing the gift.&quot;</p>

<p>A handmade treat from Suzune... to be honest, it's both bitter and sweet, but I'm really happy.</p>

<p>Her father was deeply moved when he received a gift from his adorable daughter. There's no way a Senpai could be unhappy receiving a gift from a cute Kouhai.</p>

<p>&quot;Really...? Thank you, I'll treasure it,&quot; I said with relaxing smile, gazing at the cookie. &quot;But, I never thought you could make something so cute. Suzune, you don't really cook or anything, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At first, I kept failing. The shapes were all messed up, and even when they were well-baked, they turned out as hard as rocks. But... Mimori-san taught me.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't believe my ears.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mimori did?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take a look at this.&quot;</p>

<p>Suzune pointed her smartphone at me. Somehow, they must have exchanged contact information, and there were chat records with Mimori. Even though Suzune is amateur, it is impressive how Mimori instructions, so detailed and considerate.</p>

<p>Whenever Suzune had a question, Mimori patiently guided her. If there was something hard to understand, Mimori would make a sample cookies herself, send pictures, and explain it every detail. Then, she would add a cute cat mascot-like stamp saying, &quot;Fight!&quot;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Img2/V1/00015.jpeg">

<p>Even though they only met for a single day, Mimori was genuinely supporting Suzune.</p>

<p>&quot;I gathered my courage and asked her. 'I want to make cookies as gift for my dad and to Senpai. Could you teach me how to make them?' ...Without Mimori-san, I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to bake so well,&quot; Suzune continued as I stared in her in amazement.</p>

<p>&quot;I've always felt like Mimori-san and I were living in different worlds.&quot;</p>

<p>As Suzune spoke those words, there was a hint of sadness in her expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Even when you defended Mimori-san that time, I was feeling conflicted. The Mimori-san people talked about was a girl who had no concern and would hurt people without hesitation. She lived a completely different life from mine, so I thought it was natural that we couldn't understand each other... But it wasn't like that,&quot; Suzune said with a smile, looking fondly at the cookies they made together.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that I couldn't understand, it's just that I didn't try to understand... Mimori-san turned out to be someone who would encourage and care for me, even though we just met.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suzune...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, about your earlier question. You asked if I despised you, right? ... The answer is no,&quot; Under the nightfall Suzune said wearing a gentle smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe in you, Senpai, and I believe in Mimori-san as well. I know you are earnest person, and I know Mimori-san is a kind-hearted person.&quot;</p>

<p>Her smile warmed my heart, catching me off guard. Suddenly, my eyes grew teary, and I pressed my hands against them.</p>

<p>&quot;Se-Senpai!? Wh-What's wrong? Are you feeling pain somewhere? Is it your head or your stomach?&quot; Suzune asked in panic.</p>

<p>&quot;It's neither... um, well,&quot; I replied, raising my head and desperately smiled at Suzune.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so happy because you're the first person to believe in Mimori. It's beyond words... Thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe. It's nothing much,&quot; Suzune blushed and shyly responded.</p>

<p>&quot;But, I can't help but to wonder why you were at Mimori-san's house on the day that picture was taken. So, I want you to promise me something,&quot;</p>

<p>Gently, Suzune touched my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;When the rumors about you settle down, and you have some time to sort things out, let's go somewhere together and take things easy. That time, please tell me more about Mimori-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yeah, that sounds like a plan. I also have to return the favor with some cookies.&quot;</p>

<p>I wondered if Mimori would get angry if she found out I went out with another girl. But even if she scolded me, who cares. I just hoped she would forgive me for it.</p>

<p>After all, Suzune is my one and only precious Kouhai.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One week had passed since the photo spread and it was the first school day after the weekend.</p>

<p>They say rumors last seventy-five days, but my bad reputation was still lingering, and if anything, it seemed to be getting worse. Initially, the rumors were confined to my class, but recently, they seemed to have spread to other grades as well.</p>

<p>However, for now, I just had to endure it.</p>

<p>Suzune and Kurusu-san were on my side, after all.</p>

<p>As the end bell rang, I left the classroom before anyone else. I'm heading to the disciplinary room. During lunch break today, I received a message from Kurusu-san saying, &quot;I have something important to talk about.&quot;</p>

<p>I was nervous as I opened the door, wondering if it would be good news or bad news, but as soon as I stepped in, I froze in place.</p>

<p>Kurusu-san wasn't there.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while... Are you doing okay?&quot;</p>

<p>It was Mimori.</p>

<p>She had a nonchalant expression and was leaning against the wall with her hand on her cheek. The moment I saw her, a warm feeling surged from within. Even though it had only been one week since we last met, everything about her, either her voice and expression felt nostalgic.</p>

<p>&quot;M-Mimori...? Wait, real deal, right? I was worried since we haven't seen each other for a while.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It makes me happy when you say that. I've been feeling lonely without seeing you too. I'm experiencing, Riku-kun damage lately.</p>

<p>The expression felt a bit like something from an anime...</p>

<p>&quot;But why here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought this would be the best way to meet without anyone finding out. So I asked Ruka to help me with that. I have something important to talk to you about.&quot;</p>

<p>Her serious expression gave me a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.</p>

<p>This feeling... it resembled the time when she confessed to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me put it straight... I want us to break up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aah, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Oddly enough, those words settled naturally in my heart.</p>

<p>Mimori was feeling responsible.</p>

<p>She thought it was her fault that I was isolated. That's why she wanted to pretend our relationship never happened. Somehow, I had a hunch that this was the case.</p>

<p>That's why I already had my answer.</p>

<p>&quot;I refuse... I can't accept breaking up like this.&quot;</p>

<p>With a resolute conviction, I continued.</p>

<p>&quot;If it's because you're tired of me or your feelings are fading, I could accept that as rejection. But that's not it, right? You're trying to break up for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p>It's been like that for a long time. Pretending to be strangers at school and avoiding going out together&mdash;all of it was to protect me.</p>

<p>Because she knew I would be treated coldly by others like now.</p>

<p>&quot;Breaking up is supposed to be the last resort, right? It might be tough right now, but with time, everyone will forget the rumors,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;It's different, Riku-kun... As long as I'm at this school, the rumors will never disappear,&quot; she replied, smiling as if she had given up on something.</p>

<p>&quot;I've seen many boys like you. They were treated coldly by others, and some of them couldn't bear it and transferred to another school. I don't want you to become like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be fine, really. I can endure this much. Back in middle school, girls said even worse things to me. Compared to this...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly why,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>For a moment, my heart seemed to stop.</p>

<p>Mimori had a sad expression I had never seen before.</p>

<p>&quot;Because of that past, you were hurt so much that you became uncomfortable around the females, right? ... I don't want you to go through that again because of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Ah, I see... I guess she can see right through me.</p>

<p>Mimori's words were on point. Even though I pretended to be fine with Kurusu-san and Suzune... somewhere in my heart, I'm afraid on going back to my past self.</p>

<p>&quot;...But it's okay. I can endure it if it's just a little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, you're pushing yourself too hard, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>I suppose so. I must be doing something out of character.</p>

<p>&quot;Since the day we started dating, I knew it would eventually come to this. But even so, I kept going because I liked you,&quot; Mimori said, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for causing trouble. I guess it must have been annoying to have your first girlfriend be a girl with such terrible rumors, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I tightened my grip on my hand so much that my nails dug into my palm.</p>

<p>Mimori had been covering up her own rumors all this time. She never denied the awful things people said about her, like sleeping with anyone or the like.</p>

<p>Asking Mimori about it would be easy. But I knew she would dodge the question with the same &quot;it's a secret&quot; answer as before.</p>

<p>That thought weighed heavily on my heart, causing me unbearable pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's stop here. If we stay together for too long, the teachers might start suspecting something,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>As if the conversation had ended, Mimori got up from her seat.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Mimori... I'm glad I got to meet you,&quot; I desperately called out to her small back as she reached for the door.</p>

<p>&quot;So, please stop saying things like breaking up for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>She opened the door and glanced back only once.</p>

<p>Her expression was the same as always, a smile that never changed.</p>

<p>&quot;Bye-bye. Thanks for being with me. And, well... I'll take responsibility for you feeling isolated.&quot;</p>

<p>The door closed, leaving me alone with mix feelings. I wanted to vent my frustrations by punching the wall, but I held back. It would probably be meaningless anyway.</p>

<p>And a certain question lingered in my mind.</p>

<p>Mimori said she would take responsibility... What did she mean by that?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mimori said &quot;we should break up,&quot; and the truth about Mimori's rumors.</p>

<p>Thinking about such things all the time, I couldn't sleep properly last night. Because of it, it taken a affect in my body, making it more harder to go to school.</p>

<p>Especially in the morning, before the class starts, I can hear some conversations because my seat is in the middle.</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, I can't stand with guys who have ulterior motives. The guys only wanted to do indecent things when they're not even lovers. The first time should be with someone special, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Several female students respond with nods and agrees to Manaka's words. Each time, their glances pierce through me, forcing me to gaze out of the window.</p>

<p>It felt like I was being publicly executed.</p>

<p>Other students gossip about me with a mix of disgust and curiosity, but in Manaka's case, there seems to be genuine hatred behind her words. Otherwise, she wouldn't be badmouthing me with such a loud voice, audible enough for me to hear.</p>

<p>What's even more annoying is that Manaka and the others believe that her words are the truth.</p>

<p>Maybe because she thought her claims she believes in are the truth, so she's already declaring me as impure, even though I, the person haven't experienced it.</p>

<p>During lunch break or short breaks, I can escape to them with ease but, morning is always the worst and painful times in this room.</p>

<p>'Is the teacher still not here? Please start the class already.'</p>

<p>Quietly praying in my mind, the door opens... but my expectations are betrayed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, everyone. Listen up. Your teacher from Japanese Class said, you should study on our own for about 10-mins, because the print-out's we're supposed to use got lost.&quot; A single male student announced.</p>

<p>...Are you serious.</p>

<p>While everyone around me celebrates, I can only feel disappointment and dumbfounded emotions. Are you saying that this suffering will last for another ten minutes?</p>

<p>Someone in the classroom speaks to the guy who brought the news.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Shiramine-sensei is quite old, isn't she? Maybe she's not good with printers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought that too, but Kurusu-san, the student disciplinary chair is with her, right? She was helping her, so it'll probably be fine. I'm not sure if it's part of her duties or something, though.&quot;</p>

<p>The classroom gradually filled with chatter and noise. Of course, Manaka's conversation reaches my ears involuntarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, the idea of finishing your first time with Mimori is just so gross. Do you really want to graduate from being a virgin? It's the worst, that kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Enough, I'm fed up.</p>

<p>*Sigh*, I let out a deep sigh. I couldn't take this anymore. It would be better to skip class; it's far more painful here than getting called out by the teachers. So, I stand up from my seat...</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, I didn't know that... Manaka-san, is surprisingly innocent.&quot;</p>

<p>That sweet and innocent voice sent a chill down my spine.</p>

<p>It wasn't just me; everyone fell silent at the girl's words, and the classroom was wrapped in an uncomfortable stillness.</p>

<p>Why's Mimori here, in the middle of the class, during a lesson, in my classroom?</p>

<p>&quot;...Mi-Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>Manaka's face stiffens. On the other hand, Mimori wears a relaxed smile.</p>

<p>This never cross my mind, the Mimori who never interfered with others is now talking to Manaka, exposing herself for the attention.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong? You seemed so cheerful just a moment ago, and now you seem tense... Is it really that surprising to see me here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh? What's with that attitude, trying to pick a fight? Besides, why's a slut like you here? You're so annoying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't want to get involved with someone like you, Manaka-san. But you've been causing trouble, and I can't let that slide. I need at least one complaint; otherwise, I won't be satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori sits at my desk and looks down at Manaka. It sends shivers down my spine to see that smile.</p>

<p>What is she planning to do?</p>

<p>&quot;Regarding the rumors about me and this Tokami-kun. You're the one who spread this guy's picture taken outside my apartment, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah, so what? It's not like I care if people called me nuisance. It's natural for them to badmouth you anyways; since you let Tokami have some fun, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Manaka-san, you're really naive. Shouldn't you think about it more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?! Are you underestimating me?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because that rumor is completely wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, is she going to reveal our relationship here?</p>

<p>But I can't believe that Mimori, who protected it all this time, is now willing exposed it herself....</p>

<p>&quot;When you say you 'let Tokigami have some fun,' it sounds like he asked it for it, but it was actually me who invited him, because I wanted him to have some fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;--Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Unintentionally, a voice slips from my lips.</p>

<p>The classroom now is filled with commotion. "Wait, this is different from what we heard." I can hear voices here and there expressing confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;Because Tokami-kun's face was quite attractive to me. He seem wasn't very experienced with girls, and I thought his innocence and cuteness were charming. So, I invited him to come over to my place.&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori grinned as if she were a mistress in a T.V. drama.</p>

<p>With each word Mimori speaks, my restlessness intensifies, and the sound of my heartbeat grows louder.</p>

<p>&quot;I think Tokami-kun had some idea too... He got scared at the last moment and went home. It's quite disappointing, you know? I thought he knows my rumors.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What...! Why are you saying it like that! Are you crazy for just wanting to sleep with someone you took a liking to?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Manaka-san, despite your appearance, you're quite serious, huh? I mean, it's none of your business who I sleep with. ...Or is it that you're still holding a grudge because your boyfriend got stolen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;--! You bastard, you bitch!!&quot;</p>

<p>Screams and angry shouts echoed throughout the classroom.</p>

<p>Manaka kicked the chair away and lunged at Mimori. As the guys stopped her, but she still continued to verbally abuse Mimori. However, Mimori had a composed smile on her face.</p>

<p>While absentmindedly observing that scene, I muttered to myself, &quot;Ah, I see... so that's the plan.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like always, Mimori always protects me, no matter what. With this, she could pretend that I was victim while hiding our relationship. In short all blame would go to Mimori, who tempted me, and I would merely be caught up in it. By using the rumors of her circulating in this school, it would be effortless for Mimori to create such situation.</p>

<p>Provoking Manaka was probably intentional as well. If those around me realize that they did bad things towards others, they would lose interest in it.</p>

<p>Even with this situation, self-study could work on Mimori's advantage. Since all the students are watching, the fact that I am innocent will become widely known in an instant. Judging from what the male student said earlier, he probably received cooperation from Kurusu-san.</p>

<p>This is Mimori's way of taking responsibility, I see. It's undoubtedly a perfect move, except for one thing,</p>

<p>Mimori, what will happen to you?</p>

<p>Are you going to be even hated and isolated than before?</p>

<p>Why do you hurt yourself so much to protect me?</p>

<p>&quot;If only Tokami-kun admitted nothing happened in the beginning, it would be more easier to him. Oh maybe he got afraid saying it because he ran away. So that's it, that's reason why I came. It's annoying to be gossiped about things that didn't even happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!? Don't you dare say that, you who's always fooling around!&quot;</p>

<p>Right after that, Shiramine-sensei opened the classroom door. Probably, the commotion was audible from outside. Shiramine-sensei looked nervous.</p>

<p>Mimori left the classroom without even sparing a glance at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, everyone, please be quiet. Let's start the class.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite the teacher's warning, the murmurs in the classroom still didn't subsided. While Manaka, with a contorted face full of anger, was being calmed down by her friends.</p>

<p>Amidst all that, I was the only one left in a daze.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I felt neither anger nor sadness. There was only a profound sense of loss.</p>

<p>What I did realize was that I no longer needed to endure the rumors surrounding me. And... Mimori had chosen a path where others would look down on her for my sake.</p>

<p>After that point, I don't remember much.</p>

<p>The consciousness felt hazy, like I was dreaming, and before I knew it, both classes and the closing ceremony were over. The students around me were talking about Mimori non-stop&mdash;disgust, curiosity, insults, and jealousy. Those words reached my ears.</p>

<p>As I slowly packed my textbook into my bag, a male student's voice came from nearby.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Tokami... I-I'm sorry about what happened before.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Takahashi-kun. He had a wry smile on his face as he apologetically clasped his hands together.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I can understand your feelings too. Running away right before the big event is something I'd be too embarrassed to admit too... But, you know, it's good that the misunderstanding was cleared up.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't really care about any of that.</p>

<p>Without looking at Takahashi-kun, I continued preparing to head home. Did he think something was strange about my behavior? Takahashi-kun fell silent... but then.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see....&quot; he spoke again with a cheerful tone as if he realize something. &quot;Come to think of it, You've been asking about Mimori various things for quite some time... If that's the case, I feel sorry for you. It seems like Mimori doesn't have any special feelings for you.&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't understand what he was talking about, nor did I have any interest.</p>

<p>As I was about to stand up... Takahashi-kun muttered something half-jokingly under his breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Could it be that you... you, had a crush on Mimori?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't move a single finger.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey... What's really going on with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Normally, I would instantly deny such a question. However, strangely, those words settled in my heart.</p>

<p>I see... I just didn't realize it.</p>

<p>I admonished myself not to fall for anyone. I was afraid that if I fell for someone, It wouldn't be reciprocated, and the memories of the past would crush me.</p>

<p>But is that really the case?</p>

<p>Why do I feel so empty after breaking up with Mimori?</p>

<p>Why am I getting hurt because of her situation?</p>

<p>I must have already... fallen for Mimori.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh, damn it! What the hell is with that bitch! She really pisses me off!&quot;</p>

<p>I heard Manaka's voice nearby. She must have been yelling like that all day. She probably didn't even notice the exasperated expressions on her friends' faces.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't forgive her! This time, I'll gather evidence of her slutty behavior and make her apologize. She's just a slut who sleeps around with guys all the time, right? A crazy-headed girl like her should just disappear&mdash;&quot; (TL: Is slutty the right word?)</p>

<p>&quot;You're so noisy, Manaka.&quot;</p>

<p>Manaka's voice, disparaging Mimori, fell silent.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind if you don't like Mimori. But don't say things like 'slut' or 'crazy-headed.' Frankly, it's unpleasant to hear,&quot; I said calmly.</p>

<p>I could feel something hot bubbling inside my chest.</p>

<p>With a vacant expression, Manaka looked at me. Naturally, there was no one in this classroom who would support Mimori. I must appear like an outsider to them.</p>

<p>But I didn't care.</p>

<p>Right now, I wanted to let myself be consumed by this anger.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sick of you guys making baseless claims about Mimori sleeping with any guy she likes. Is there even a single person in this school who has slept with her? No, there isn't, because Mimori has rejected every male student's advances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Why are you defending Mimori anyways?&quot;</p>

<p>Manaka's expression was filled with irritation.</p>

<p>&quot;Come to think of it, didn't you have a conversation with Mimori a while back? ...Could it be that you're happy because she was nice to you? Considering an unpopular guy like you, it wouldn't be surprising if you misunderstood and thought she'd let you have a go.&quot;</p>

<p>Other students noticed the tense atmosphere and looked at us from a distance, speechless.</p>

<p>The tension between Manaka and me permeated the classroom, making it quiet.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Mimori hasn't denied the rumors herself, right? If they were all lies, I think she would clearly deny them... After all, She's used item.&quot;</p>

<p>I clenched my teeth so hard that it made a grinding sound.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of expression I had on my face in this moment. Manaka grinned and continued,</p>

<p>&quot;With so many nasty rumors floating around, it's only natural to think that Mimori has some guilty secrets, right? Too bad, maybe you're disappointed?&quot;</p>

<p>I shouted from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it hurts&mdash;it hurts so damn much!&quot;</p>

<p>Manaka fell silent as if struck by my outburst.</p>

<p>&quot;Whether Mimori is a virgin or not, or whether she has been with other guys without being in a relationship, I don't know anything about that. But if that's true, it hurts so much it like it's getting torn apart!&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, it would hurt.</p>

<p>Because I... I care about Mimori so much.</p>

<p>&quot;But you know, despite all that, Mimori is such a kind person!&quot;</p>

<p>My voice echoed in the silent classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me tell you this, we we're hiding our relationship all this time, you know why? Just because I wouldn't be isolated like I do now. That person also feels loneliness too, even though she wanted to talk to me normally at school, she's pretending to be someone else all the time, just for me! Even just a while ago, she covered all of it by admitting she invited me!&quot;</p>

<p>All of my feelings I couldn't say back then, I'm going to let it all out here.</p>

<p>&quot;And you know what? Her smile is really cute, but she's pretending unfriendly at school. She's devoted person who can make you feel happy just being with her and you guys talk about her like she lacks morals, she's a pure girl who would make lunch for the person she likes. Hey, did Mimori do something to you? Did she do anything to hurt you? Everyone&mdash;why don't you try to understand her...?&quot;</p>

<p>The scene of Mimori and me together, which no one else sees anymore. The club room during lunch break that no one uses. A room in the tall but beautiful apartment. The sunset view from the Ferris wheel besides the sea. The disciplinary room where she told to break up.</p>

<p>For some reason, the memories of being alone with Mimori are burned into my mind and won't fade away.</p>

<p>&quot;To you all, Mimori might be someone who sleeps around with anyone. But let me tell you something...&quot;</p>

<p>Staring at my dumbfounded classmates, I make up my mind and declare.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be with Mimori. I won't forgive anyone who mocks her!&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori, Manaka, Takahashi, and everyone else&mdash;they all remained silent, saying nothing.</p>

<p>I grabbed my bag and started walking, with students making way for me, avoiding my path. I said what I needed to say, and how they take it is up to them.</p>

<p>Right now, all I wanted was to see her.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I walked through the corridor and suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>There was a female student in the courtyard below the window. Ah, that's right. Mimori often used the courtyard when heading home.</p>

<p>There she was, looking up at me with a melancholic expression.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had been looking at my classroom. When our eyes met, Mimori's face showed surprise, and she seemed like she wanted to turn away.</p>

<p>Ah, so she really intends to cut off our relationship, Huh.</p>

<p>Just as I thought that, I placed my foot on the window frame and leaned out. The wind gently brushed against my cheeks. Sensing something unusual, I heard a murmur of students from behind.</p>

<p>Every time I gazed at Mimori from the window, I always thought the same thing.</p>

<p>Even though I couldn't muster the courage to call out to her or even wave my hand&mdash;it would be great if I could overcome this distance and go see her.</p>

<p>&quot;Mimori!&quot;</p>

<p>I kicked the window frame and jumped from the second-floor building.</p>

<p>As the gravity pulled me, I landed on my feet, and the impact almost made me lose consciousness. But somewhere in my heart, I was impressed by the fact that humans are incredible; even from such a considerable height, they can still survive.</p>

<p>And there, right in front of me, was Mimori, staring at me in shock.</p>

<p>Mimori rushed towards me in a fluster. I wanted to run to her too, but my feet felt scorching hot, making it seem impossible.</p>

<p>&quot;R-Riku-kun...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad. I guess, you've stopped pretending to be someone else now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In a situation like this, no one can just ignore it. Why did you jump?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I guess... I just wanted to see you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does it hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It hurts so much that I want to cry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know what? Riku-kun, you're really stupid.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, maybe I am.&quot;</p>

<p>A small smile appeared on Mimori's lips. Good, she finally smiled.</p>

<p>When I looked around, many students were peering down from the windows of the school building.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, I just told everyone in the class not to mock you... I'm sorry. Even though you went as far as to act and defend me, I ruined it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh... Why'd you that? then you'll end up like me, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd rather break up with you than see you hurt. If you're going to get hurt, I want to share that pain too. Even if I lose my place in this school, it's fine as long as I have a place next to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>Mimori's eyes, at a loss for words, tremble as if tears are about to spill.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, I don't know anything about you, Mimori. Why you don't deny the rumors or what happened in the past. I've struggled with your secrets and all, but still, I want to be with you. I want to know more about you... That's why...&quot;</p>

<p>I gaze straight into Mimori's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;But there's something I must tell you. Something I can only say now since we've already broked up. It's something I couldn't bring myself to say not long ago... It reminds me of the day when you first confessed to me.&quot;</p>

<p>From somewhere, I felt the sweet aroma of donuts in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Mimori... Please go out with me again.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling the embarrassment, the world seems like stop for a second. Remembering the word &quot;I love you&quot; there's part of me wants to run away, but it was worth it that I told her. Because, right now, the master teaser Mimori&#9472;&#9472; is blushing up to the ears right now.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...? W-wait, did I mishear you? You mean, you... love me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said it clearly. It's not because I don't want you to be with someone else like before. I want to be with you because I love you, Mimori.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-again, you love me...! Ugh~...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been thinking this for a while, but Mimori, you're really vulnerable to surprises aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... Well, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>Blushing, Mimori averted her gaze, looking embarrassed, and then...</p>

<p>She broke into a radiant, innocent smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel the same way. Please take care of me, and I love you too, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>
