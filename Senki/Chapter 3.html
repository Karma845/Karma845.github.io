<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter Ⅲ: Confession of Love</h1>

<p class="calibre5">In the morning, I park my bike in the school’s bicycle lot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Saturday has ended, Sunday has passed, and it’s now Monday.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Damn.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I haven’t slept at all these past two days. As a result, I can’t stop yawning.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…There’s no way I can sort out my thoughts. What the hell is happening in my life?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was too shocked at the mall, and I haven’t really talked to Enomoto-san since. The taxi ride home was unbearably awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I head toward the school building, I hear Himari’s voice coming from behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, good mornin’&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">My head is pounding. She’s really too energetic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even at the mall, she said she was going to buy a drink and left first. She’s been ignoring all my messages.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, I’m thankful for it now. A distraction is welcome.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Himari. Good… morning?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari waved back with her usual smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…From about three meters away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s going on? Why is she so far away?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s not coming over, just standing there waving. She looks like a mannequin in the mall’s clothing section.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, come here.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari high-fives in the spot, still smiling….to the empty space in front of her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu. You seem down.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She continues as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What is this? It’s like a glitch in an online game.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seriously scary. She was normal on Saturday, wasn’t she?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did something happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, come on, that’s a bit too much. If I did something…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I moved toward Himari. Instantly, she kept her distance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I moved forward, Himari stepped back. When I stepped back, Himari came forward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We stared at each other, maintaining exactly three meters of distance.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, seriously, what’s going on!? You’re acting weird!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Aaah! Yuu, stay back! Don’t come any closer!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, why!? Tell me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really wish she wouldn’t do this in front of the other students. Especially since Himari is cute, we’re attracting quite a bit of attention.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Did I do something? If I’ve offended you somehow…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah~ It’s not like that. I just kinda feel like keeping a distance of about three meters from Yuu…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What kind of mood is that? I wish she’d consider how it feels to be shadowed like a satellite.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, a voice called out from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu-kun, good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I turned around, startled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was Enomoto-san. She stared at me with her usual cold expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not ready for this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I floundered for words, she frowned and tugged at the sleeve of my uniform, pulling it toward her. Then, she greeted me firmly once again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…G-Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Overwhelmed by her presence, I returned the greeting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Enomoto-san averted her gaze with a shy ‘Hehe’ and smiled. That adorable gesture pierced right through my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Wait, what’s going on here?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t she being unusually friendly all of a sudden?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a complete change from when we said hello at the mall on Saturday. Did she reset overnight like a video game NPC?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oblivious to my confusion, Enomoto-san tilted her head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu-kun, what are you doing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Yuu-kun. My nickname.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, it was decided when we said goodbye on Saturday that she would call me that from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We also exchanged Line contacts… that was the extent of it, though.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s just that Himari…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san looked over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari, standing three meters away, trebled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">An awkward silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a tense look, Himari began to slowly back away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably planning to flee backward in retreat… But seriously, what about class?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu-kun, I’ll handle this.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Enomoto-san made her move.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She reached into the bag over her shoulder. What she pulled out was… a beautifully packaged cookie.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan, I brought cookies.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh, really!? Yay!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari approached.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And just before she could receive the cookie──she was abruptly grabbed by the back of the neck.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Gyaaah!? Enocchi, you tricked me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t just casually talk while grabbing me by the nape! I’m not a cat, you know, I’m a human!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re pretty much the same thing. Come on, stop playing around here and let’s go to the classroom.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay, okay, I got it&mdash;let go of me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Wow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That Himari is completely at her mercy. This must be the skill she honed from those childhood days.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We took off our shoes at the entrance and headed to the classroom together, the three of us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s distance was back to normal, but she’s been complaining non-stop.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi, you’re always so forceful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s Hi-chan’s fault. You’re always causing trouble for people.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The only person I’m troubling is Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmph. I wonder why out of all Yuu-kun’s friends, it had to be Hi-chan…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san seems genuinely annoyed. It’s difficult to grasp the distance between these two.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As we were going up the stairs, Enomoto-san took another small packet of cookies from her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She clutched it with a mysterious determination and glanced at me. When our eyes met, she hurriedly looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She took a deep breath and then looked back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What is she doing? I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, with a tense look, Enomoto-san held out the small packet to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu-kun, you can have one as well…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? T-Thank you…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I accepted it reverently</p>
<p class="calibre5">What…? Is it that embarrassing to hand over cookies?</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s blushing so much… really cute… Oh, no, maybe I shouldn’t stare at Enomoto-san’s face too much.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s that one. The cookie with a pattern made from milk and cocoa dough.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I only knew about the square checkerboard pattern, but this one has a comical cat drawn on it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…What meticulous work.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is this from Enomoto-san’s home?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ouch. For some reason, I got pinched on the butt by Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What were you planning to do if I accidentally raised my voice too loud?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, are you actually an idiot? In this situation, would you really say something so tactless?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…so, it’s handmade by Enomoto-san…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san vigorously nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I look closely, there’s no store label on it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m only good at this…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Is she being modest?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve only seen such beautiful cookies in Western-style sweet shops in Tokyo featured on TV. I’ll eat them alone later.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari will definitely try to snatch them away, but I seriously won’t give her the chance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well then, Yuu-kun, see you after school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As she reached the top of the stairs, Enomoto-san waved her hand and left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…she’s cool and cute when she leaves.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, your nose is totally stretched out.” (TN: Figurative, similar to drooling over in english, 鼻の下を伸ばす)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I covered my nose with my palm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari peered into my face with a grin. Damn it. It would have been better if she stayed three meters away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not stretched.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Lies. You’re totally smitten with Enocchi.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Smitten…?” (メロメロ)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Are you from the Showa era? Even old men hanging around in izakayas nowadays don’t talk like that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari covered her mouth and nudged me with her elbow, laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Being called ‘Yuu-kun’ and all that. Don’t flirt too much in front of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, we’re not flirting or anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, or maybe, was I in the way? Nfufu, should I leave you two alone after school today? How about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“And in return, what are you planning to take?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You don’t trust me? I’m just wishing for the happiness of my dear friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh. That sounds so dodgy…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Once I let my guard down around her, it felt like she could take everything I own.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sighed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Besides, we’re not dating or anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Huh!? Why not!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean, ‘why not’…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because you were confessed to on Saturday, weren’t you!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wha-!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">This girl, what is she shouting in the hallway?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The eyes of the surrounding students suddenly all turned towards us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, come here!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, woah! Yuu, I’m going to fall!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I grabbed Himari’s bag and pulled her to a less crowded area.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I explained the situation to Himari, who was now against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t get it wrong. I wasn’t confessed to or anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eeh… But, weren’t you confessed to by your first love at the flower shop?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah! You were eavesdropping on our conversationl, weren’t you!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">‘Ah, crap…’ After that, Himari turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she tried to whistle casually and escape sideways, I blocked her with both arms and held her in place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t run away.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Having lost her escape route, Himari stopped moving as if she had resigned herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is seriously giving me a headache…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No wonder you went home without saying anything. You were being all considerate in a weird way. Thinking back on it… ever since I fixed Enomoto-san’s accessory, you’ve been acting strange. Bringing up Enomoto-san’s name for some reason, trying to do strange things…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At my words, Himari was startled in reaction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“S-Strange things…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Like suggesting we try kissing, remember? That was… hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Something was off about Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She curled up between my arms, her face turning as red as if it could emit steam.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Holding her slender arms in front of her face, she trembled as if trying to escape my gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">[Image00015]</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s with this reaction?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why are your ears all red? Are you in a pizza commercial? Crispy crust with plenty of cheese all the way to your ears?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Rather, you’re the one who’s supposed to be eating, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What is this? You’re throwing me off…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s just, Yuu, you’re saying weird things…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I haven’t said anything weird. I’m just repeating what you said!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s what I’m saying, what you’re repeating is the strange thing!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You’re the one who said it in the first place!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seriously, this is defamation at its finest.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If this were a trial, I’d have won so convincingly that I’d get a coupon for a free set of fries and a cola as a bonus…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, there’s nothing going on with Enomoto-san. Sure, I was surprised by her at that time. But that doesn’t mean we’ve talked about anything else. She probably just thinks of it as a good memory, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why do I have to make excuses like I’m cheating, especially to Himari?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What if someone sees this and starts spreading weird rumors?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, she was my first love, but after all, that doesn’t mean Enomoto-san feels the same. Rather, it’s a nuisance to be suspected of weird things. Got it? So, could you, Himari, stop poking around about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Himari took out a drinkable yogurt from her bag. Sipping it, she stared at me intently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s this? I can tell I’m being assessed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her expression had suddenly turned calm and collected, a complete change from before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When the yogurt pack crumpled with a pop, she carefully folded it and put it back in her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Drinking it in one gulp caused her to hiccup.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she started scrutinizing my face again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-What? Aren’t you being kind of emotionally unstable today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not true. I think Yuu is an idiot.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why?! All of this is your fault… urgh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari took out another drinkable yogurt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As usual, she shoved the straw into my mouth and slipped out from between my arms while I was flustered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, come to the classroom after you cool down with that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah!? You got what I’m trying to say, right!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She waved her hand without looking back and left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Left behind, I finished off the yogurt drink.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What was that all about…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She was clearly acting strange.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was teasing as usual, but her reaction to my comebacks was so, so… no, forget it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The yogurt pack made a loud noise as I crushed it. Cool down complete.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Lactic acid bacteria are really the best.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m already sleepy, don’t exhaust me first thing in the morning…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That just now was seriously uncalled for.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Somehow, I found myself thinking Himari was kind of cute today.</p>

<p>♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">After school, we were in the science lab having a prototype meeting for our new accessory creation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I laid out the flowers I had prepared on Sunday in front of Himari and Enomoto-san. The shadows of tulips were visible in the solution.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Tulip flowers were carefully removed from a sealed container after soaked overnight in an ethanol solution mixed with various substances.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san’s eyes widened upon seeing this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, they’re white…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The variously colored tulips had completely lost their pigment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I arranged them on the equipment, I explained.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s said that a certain component in the pigments causes flowers to wilt. So, I extracted that component using the ethanol solution. Doing this also removes the pigments, which is why they turn completely white.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So, what about the color?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’re going to dye them now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you mean you take the color out and then put color back in?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it might seem like double the effort. But if we don’t do this, the flowers will quickly wilt even after we process them into flower accessories.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Preserved flowers are essentially a technique to keep flowers in a state of suspended animation to preserve them for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Any shortcuts here and no matter how beautifully they’re dyed, it’s pointless.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The tulips laid out on the equipment must be handled with care. The components extracted with ethanol also play a role in retaining the freshness of the flowers. Without them, the flowers are extremely fragile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For hydration, glycerin solution is mixed with ink for dyeing. Once the preparation is complete, the stems of the flowers are pierced and left to absorb the ink by themselves…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, don’t push my back, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I turned around with a smile, and Himari grinned back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s like she’s saying, ‘Do you think cute little me just can’t help but pay attention to you? You’re so self-conscious!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sure, she’s cute, but then what’s with her trying to sneak up behind me, waving her hands all over the place!?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, I’m counting on you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Understood.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Caught by Enomoto-san, Himari had her scruff immediately grabbed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan. You shouldn’t interfere.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kyaaah! Yuu, isn’t it sneaky to rely on Enocchi!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, it’s not sneaky.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While Enomoto-san held Himari down, I quickly set up the equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The stems of the tulips were dipped into various warm-colored glycerin solutions.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By this time tomorrow, they should be colored.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s quite a long process, isn’t it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san muttered, impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Indeed, processing flowers takes time. Even now, as this is a prototype, many steps were skipped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The actual products to be shipped go through much finer procedures to completion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, it always takes more time because Himari keeps messing with me…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I glared at Himari just like a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hindered by Enomoto-san’s guard, Himari stretched out on the table across from us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She sighed heavily and took a slurp from her yoghut.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sigh…Yuu has changed, huh? You used to say so cutely that ‘I’m going to marry Himari Onee-chan when I turned 30!’…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When did you become my Onee-chan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When we’re alone, you’re all lovey-dovey…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, can you not say things that sound so serious? Enomoto-san is here, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…?”</p>


<p class="calibre5">Himari’s juice box made a sucking noise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I glanced at Enomoto-san. Enomoto-san tilted her head, not understanding the meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The corners of Himari’s mouth twisted into a sly grin… I had a bad feeling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Enocchi wasn’t here, is it okay to play a trial kissing game like last week?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I felt the blood drain from my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I impulsively grabbed her by the collar and snapped at her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you talking about!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari burst out laughing with a “Pfffthaha!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ehh. But you said it wasn’t weird, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t twist my words! I said it was weird that you asked me if I’d give you a trial kiss…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, you admitted it now? You just admitted that you played a trial kissing game with me last week?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t latch onto thattt!!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was startled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A cold gaze… like a sharp spear, was piercing through my back. When I barely turned around, there was Enomoto-san glaring at me intensely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Expressionless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her unreadable eyes stared at me. As I stood there gaping like a fish out of water, she slowly rose to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Slung her bag over her shoulder and calmly swept up the hair by her ear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I, it’s time, I’m sorry. I need to go, to the club… Bye.” (ア, ワタシ, オトアワセノジカンダ. ブカツ, イカナキャ. ……ジャアネ)</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san!? Why are you speaking so stiffly… Ugh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a bang, the science room’s door was slammed shut. The sound of slippers pattering away faded into the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s gone…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Should I make some excuse? No, why should I?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not like she caught us cheating or anything. We’re not even in that kind of relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then why is she angry?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, that’s because Himari was playing pranks… Ah.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Seriously, Himarriiiiii!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pffft, Yuu, you’re really funny!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari was lying on the six-seater table, laughing her head off.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As she kicked her legs in amusement, her slippers flew off and hit the steel shelf.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re definitely getting back at me for this morning, aren’t you!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“So what if I am?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t get cocky!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. But really, I didn’t expect things to go this smoothly. This is the masterpiece of my life. Ah, I should have recorded it… Pffftahahah!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no way I’d let it be recorded.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If something like that got out, I’d never be able to show my face to Enomoto-san again… Wait, Himari is holding her stomach and trembling as if in agony.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, how long are you going to keep laughing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is bad. I think I’m hitting a nerve. This is really bad, my stomach is twisting…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That much? Hey, how much are we talking?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“This is going to last a while. Yuu, give me a hand. Ah, I can’t take it anymore…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really now…”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">I reached out to pull her up from the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, I froze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari, lying on her back on the table, had grabbed my arm. Unlike before, a different kind of warmth from her lips enveloped her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s breath quickened, her white skin blushing slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From her largely opened uniform collar, a gentle but definite swell was visible… and incidentally, the delicate frilled fabric covering it as well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Do you want to…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“W-what…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I found myself staring at Himari’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes were large like almonds, a beautiful marine blue like jewels. Slightly moist. It’s understandable after all that laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari breathed out softly, her bangs fluttered slightly, and the sweet scent of the yogurt drink she’d had earlier lingered.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway, Enocchi probably thinks we’ve done it, right? Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to just do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not the kind of thing you consider ‘beneficial’.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why not? We’ll probably end up doing it when we turn 30 anyway. Or are you really just going to be a cover for my matchmaking meetings? Is that okay with you, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s, that was just your joke…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that what you think? …I wouldn’t say such things even as a joke to anyone else.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari gently closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was so defenseless, as if leaving all decisions up to me. And as if to deliver the coup de grâce, she whispered in a faint voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Aren’t you going to make an ‘love’ accessory? Should I experience it with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_09.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">Strength coiled tight in the hand grasping my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unable to shake it off, I inadvertently bent at the waist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No-no. What am I doing? Why am I leaning over her as if to cover her?</p>

<p class="calibre5">This looks serious, like we might actually do it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But, it’s not like I’m dating Enomoto-san. There wouldn’t be a problem if we did.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, nobody would notice, and it’s just the two of us in this room.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This school building is mostly empty at this hour. If I wanted to, from now on… from now on? What’s next? No, I know what’s next.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the other person is Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We’re best friends, aren’t we?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s always been that way. It’s not just about convenience when you need experience&mdash;that’s not friendship, that’s friends with benefits.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t think of Himari as such a casual partner…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, but damn it! She’s cute! Why does she have to be so attractive!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">And she’s also popular! Why have I been treating Himari like just one of the guys up until now…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, a sound of a vibration broke the silence.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably a smartphone. A LINE message or something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s not unusual. It’s normal to bring smartphones to this school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In this quiet science room, the sound could be heard quite clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The problem was that the sound seemed to come from between Himari and the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s left hand. Unlike her right hand, which was gripping my arm, it was hidden under her own skirt… and right now, Himari had been making a face as if to say ‘oops.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Himari. Open your eyes.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Show me that hidden left hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wha&mdash;&mdash;are you going to make sure I can’t move my hands? Yuu, I didn’t know you were into that kind of thing. You’re a devil!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari smiled sweetly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…At that moment, the sultry and feverish atmosphere disappeared.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Take this!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I grabbed Himari’s left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was holding a smartphone with the camera clearly on, displaying my foolish face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A scream echoed in the science room for who knows how many times today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himariiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pffhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">How much more should I get hit?!</p>
<p class="calibre5">You’re not seriously trying to take a video, are you?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what do you want to do? What are you planning to do with my weakness in your grasp!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, teasing Enocchi turned out to be more fun than I thought. Yuu, you’re simple and give me plenty of good material.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Never mind me, but don’t play around with Enomoto-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, you’re so sweet on Enocchi. As expected of a guy, a creature that can’t forget his first love!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up! I don’t want to hear that from a girl who prioritizes the mood of the moment!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took Himari’s arm and pulled her up from the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari said, ‘Ahh, really, Yuu is the best…’ while flapping her collar as if it were a fan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I suddenly noticed her slippers were missing. Looking around, I saw them fall in front of a shelf.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Alright, there we go.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari hopped on one foot to retrieve her slippers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With my heart still pounding, I cleaned up the scattered equipment on the other table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I put away the tulips that were being dyed in the middle of the process into the steel shelf, fixing them firmly with the equipment so they wouldn’t shake in case of an earthquake or if a student bumped into them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I told you it’s fine, just do it already…Idiot.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost dropped the equipment in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around, Himari was playing with the fallen slippers, not even looking this way.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himari, did you say something?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s just, you, just now…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Yuu, are you so concerned about Enocchi that you hear hallucination?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She smiled sweetly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That smile had a strange pressure, and I found myself at a loss for words. Well, it might indeed be a hallucination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because if what I just heard wasn’t a mishearing…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Coward. Spineless. Flower fool.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himari, you were definitely whispering something mean right now, weren’t you!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Kyaa. Men’s hysteria is so gross.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She grabbed her bag and quickly left the science room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“How are you getting home?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m taking the bus today.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She waved her hand frantically and disappeared towards the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Left alone, I sat at the table, slumped over with my head in my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Seriously, what does she want to do?</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">Several days later. It was lunchtime on Friday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was alone in the courtyard behind the bicycle parking area. Here is the flower bed where Himari and I grow flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sitting on a bag of fertilizer piled up beside the storage, I was feeling dejected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The convenience store bread I brought from home was dry. Well, it’s unsold stock, so it’s natural.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sipped on the Yoguruppe I bought from the vending machine…Being alone is wonderful. At this moment, I was undoubtedly dandy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that silence was soon broken.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nahaha! Natsu, I hear you’ve become quite popular recently?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Makishima?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The flashy guy came over. He had a junior girl with him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…And the two of them were going, ‘This guy is Natsu,’ ‘Oh, that?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">…hey, don’t talk about me behind my back. And then I get this mysterious cheer from that junior girl, ‘Senpai, I’m rooting for you!’ I don’t quite understand, but she seems like a nice girl…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima waved goodbye to the girl and came over to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is it okay with that girl?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, no problem. She’s just a playmate after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, I see…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Typical playboy behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima had a yakisoba bread and a croquette bread in each hand. He must have been on his way back to a cozy spot after buying lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Peeling the wrapper off the yakisoba bread, Makishima asked me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What are you doing in such a gloomy place?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just wanted to be alone for a bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t you want to be lovey-dovey with Rin-chan and the others?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The ones who started being lovey-dovey were Himari and Enomoto-san. Lately, those two have been causing such a commotion that I can’t concentrate on my work…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A commotion?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, Himari provokes her, Enomoto-san picks a fight, and when I try to stop them, I get dragged in too… I really wish they’d do it somewhere else.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima choked on his laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He hurriedly shoved the bread he had bitten down his throat and smiled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fundamentally, Rin-chan doesn’t really like Himari-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Really? Aren’t they old friends?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it’s not just simple dislike. It’s more like a love-hate relationship, she hates her for being annoying a hundred times more than she adores her cuteness…Oh, right. Himari-chan resembles Rin-chan’s Onee-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san’s Onee-san? The model?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That person also helped me during junior high school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari said she had gone to Tokyo now, dedicating herself officially to modeling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, that sister is quite a free spirit herself. Rin-chan has always been cleaning up after her, and that’s how she was raised. So while she dislikes Himari-chan, who is also a free spirit, she can’t leave her be. Natsu, you feel the same way, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see… I can’t say I don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, from my perspective, they seem to get along just fine. That’s just their way of playing around. Just ignore it; Himari-chan will get her due punishment at the right moment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s a very mature opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Well, Makishima is actually quite sharp-witted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason he lives a life juggling multiple relationships without getting stabbed is because he has an exceptional ability to read the room objectively… It’s truly a waste of talent though.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I sipped my Yoguruppe, Makishima asked with a face full of smiles.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, how far have you gone with Rin?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pffft!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I almost spat out my Yoguruppe, and Makishima laughed as if he was enjoying this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…He’s definitely doing this on purpose.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Could it be, you’re still holding back? Weren’t you confessed to?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes?… was it really a confession?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As I played dumb, Makishima gave a dismissive laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I see. Natsu, you’re definitely that kind of virgin.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up. Being a virgin has nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I won’t deny it… I won’t deny I’m a virgin though! But it does hurt my pride, it’s a complicated age to be.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“First of all, I wasn’t clearly confessed to by Enomoto-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Looking at Rin’s attitude, are you seriously saying that? It’s like a super luxurious 10-tiered jubako meal box from a prestigious ryotei in Tokyo’s Akasaka, with even snacks and cookies ready to be eaten.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Your way of saying it… How can you talk about your childhood friend like that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s seriously off-putting.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even Himari would wrap things up a bit more… no, it’s pretty much the same. She loves dirty jokes too.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I get what Makishima is trying to say, but it’s not like I’m hung up on my first love from elementary school…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“On the other hand, Rin-chan is making moves like a heroine straight out of a romantic comedy manga. Even I have no choice but to watch over such pure love.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Even though she’s such a mature and beaitufl girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I totally agree. Rin-chan is getting the short end of the stick with that pure personality of hers.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Next, he peeled off the wrapper from a croquette bun and looked me over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“She finally meets her Prince Charming, and he turns out to be a wimp.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Man, you really piss me off.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“However, it seems that for Rin-chan, this wimp is actually to her liking. Seriously, my childhood friend has the worst taste in men.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Shut up!? Decide whether you want to diss me or Enomoto-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After finishing his croquette bun, Makishima patted my shoulder and stood up…Doesn’t this guy eat too fast?</p>
<p class="calibre5">He waved his hand with an exaggerated gesture and turned his back to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you don’t dislike Rin-chan, then hurry up and get together with her. Otherwise, my plan to make you Rin-chan’s husband and thus my brother-in-law can never get started.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Setting aside Hibari-san, you and Enomoto-san are just childhood friends, right…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Why do all the guys around me want to make me their brother-in-law?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I seriously don’t understand what kind of fetishism is at play here, and it makes me tremble with fear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t do anything unnecessary, please… Lately, Himari has also been a bit weird, and I can’t handle it.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima reacted with a twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He turned around quickly and asked with a serious look.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s weird about her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? Did I say something that concerns you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Come on, just answer quickly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It’s like she’s been closer than before. No that’s not it, she’s always been clingy, but now it seems like she’s forcing it somehow…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himari-chan is like that…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…If this guy always looked this serious, he’d be pretty handsome. While I was thinking that, Makishima suddenly grinned.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…that’s interesting. Maybe it’s time to probe and push a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was an ominous remark.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t do anything unnecessary!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hahaha. It’s for Natsu’s sake. You should be thankful to me instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I won’t!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…And he was gone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What is he planning to do?</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was after school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari, Enomoto-san, and I were in the science room having a photo session for the prototypes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Here we have the preserved tulips that have been dyed and then left to dry for an additional two days.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I properly arranged them on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s difficult to describe this warm gradient in just a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They were in three colors: red, yellow, and pink. Shades ranged from dark, somber tones to light, refreshing hues.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While looking at them, Enomoto-san murmured softly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“They look just like real flowers…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What, they are real flowers.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said with a wry smile, which caused Enomoto-san’s cheeks to blush crimson.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then she stared at me with a look of reproach.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu-kun. That’s mean…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry-sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had responded reflexively, as if I were dealing with Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As we were caught in an awkward atmosphere, Himari propped her cheek on her hand and started poking my back persistently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It seems like the flirting has gotten pretty ripe, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean ‘flirting has gotten ripe’…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We’re not trying to flirt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh, look. Enomoto-san’s face has gone completely red. Don’t interrupt every time we start talking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Anyway. Today, I thought we’d use these to decide on the design for the accessory.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The design of the accessory?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Since we started with the theme of tulips this time, we haven’t decided what accessory to make. It’s also Enomoto-san’s first time modeling, so I’d be happy if you could help us…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you mean by help?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’ll take lots of photos using these tulip prototypes. We’ll see where on Enomoto-san’s body the flowers look best or from what angle to take the photos to appeal to the users…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hearing about taking photos, Enomoto-san looked a bit hesitant with an ‘mm’ sound.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, that’s understandable. It’s a different feeling being photographed by a classmate than taking a picture yourself. Enomoto-san doesn’t seem like the type who’s too keen on exposing herself.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing the situation, Himari steps in to help.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi. If you’re going to be an Instagram model, you’ll need to get used to being photographed, or it’ll be tough.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But… I get nervous when it actually comes down to it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm? Is that so. Well, can’t be helped then.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari stood up, took one of the tulips in hand, and placed it near her shoulder, striking a natural pose for the camera.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With her experience, she quickly found the optimal composition for the shot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Enocchi can’t do it, maybe I should be the model again this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san reacted with a startle.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing her reaction, Himari grinned mischievously. She exaggeratedly kissed the tulip she was holding.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu is making a flower accessory with ‘love’ as a theme for the first time. It’s bound to be a cute and passionate piece. After all, it represents Yuu’s feelings of love for the model. The person who becomes the model for this accessory will be someone very special to Yuu, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san stood up abruptly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She took out her makeup pouch from her bag and glared sharply at Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I’ll do it! I’m going to do it, so Hi-chan, just be quiet!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san declared ‘I’ll go touch up my makeup!’ and left the science room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, wait. This is just a prototype, you don’t need to get so worked up… Ah, she’s gone.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari, on the other hand, was grinning and waving goodbye.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. Enocchi is really cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Himari. Don’t tease her too much…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But if I don’t say something, she might step down as the model.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then you can do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Leaning towards me, she placed her hand gently on my shoulder. With a somewhat challenging expression, she whispered in my ear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“This time, the theme of the accessory is ‘love’, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“S-So what? That’s why I chose tulips, why don’t we just go about it as usual.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is that really okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Is it not?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We’ve handled flowers that symbolize love many times before. But that wasn’t enough. What Yuu wants is something that resonates more with the users’ hearts… Something special that makes everyone who sees it fall in love, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What Himari was saying was correct.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if such a thing was easy to do, there wouldn’t be any trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You know, I really love the passion Yuu puts into your flower accessories. That’s why I asked Enocchi to model. Love is love, even if it’s from elementary school. Your unique, one-and-only first love. The only person who can capture that within the square frame of Instagram is Enocchi.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari smiled at close range.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Or could you possibly have feelings… of love for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her hand grabbed mine. I was pulled forward, my body moving closer to Himari without any resistance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">‘This is bad’ I thought, and at the moment my body touched Himari&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">The door to the science room opened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There, Enomoto-san stood with her eyes wide. A rush of emotions could be seen crossing her quiet expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She seemed about to say something, her mouth moving. But only a gasp of air escaped. We were seen, and there was no excuse.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As Enomoto-san’s left leg stepped back&mdash;&mdash;The sound of a camera shutter clicked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari held up her smartphone, showing the screen with Enomoto-san’s surprised expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s titled ‘Pure Love x Scum Cheating’. Wouldn’t it be emotional with tulips added?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not emotional at all!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was rejected.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, this time it was about warm-colored tulips. It’s love, but not the flower language of a lost love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san let out a breath of relief at our exchange. She placed a hand on her chest and said in a stunned voice.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I was… surprised…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sorry, really sorry. I was pretty surprised too because it came out of nowhere…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I glared at Himari fiercely.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. You really like taking sneaky photos lately…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe. It’s so much fun♡”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Such a rotten hobby…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Still, it’s not like she’ll listen if I tell her to stop, nor can I really do anything about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Should we get started then? Enomoto-san, are you ready?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, I’m good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We finally got to the main agenda of today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san has a band rehearsal scheduled. Meaning, we need to wrap this up in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The actual shoot will use a digital camera, but a smartphone is sufficient for now.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m used to working with Himari as a model, so I know the procedure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That part went smoothly. While directing Enomoto-san’s poses, I added tulips to the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Here it’s all about quantity and inspiration. It’s not good to get stuck on one composition.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just take a lot of photos, and reviewing them can come later.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I quickly capture each shot while adjusting various settings on the smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, raise your right hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It looks a bit like a salute. Try to feel more like you’re reaching for the sunlight…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…It’s difficult.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even so, she was a quick learner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, if only the expression would look natural… and yeah, Himari has been poking my back and it’s annoying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m bored. I mean, I’m ‘Himari-chan’ after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Be quiet. We’re at an important part right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Back to shooting. Only 15 minutes left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to start pushing for the finish. I’ve taken all the shots I originally planned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now I need a stronger flash of inspiration… darn it, Himari is poking me again!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what is it this time?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari gave a decisive thumbs up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s take a sexy shot now!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m definitely not doing that. Seriously, shut up…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She pouted with a buzz.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You know you want to take the shot.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I do not want to!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I know you’re thinking of adding her to your ‘sexy collection’ you’ve been amassing under the guise of Instagram shoots.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I swear I’ll kick you out, really!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san quietly moved away a little.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her eyes contained a suspicious glare.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t tell me, Yuu-kun. You and Hi-chan have been…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“We haven’t! Enomoto-san, don’t take what Himari says seriously…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Every photo session is utterly wholesome. That was just one of Himari’s bad jokes!</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Makishima’s weird remarks have made it seem like I’m making more excuses than necessary.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I guess we’ve taken enough pictures by now…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">But so far, nothing really clicks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They all feel too familiar. To speak frankly, they’re kind of… Himari-like.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I feel what Sakunee-san calls the ‘stagnant miniature garden’ right now</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s exactly it. All the compositions so far were just retracing those I took with Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I were to make a blunt statement, there was no need for Enomoto-san to be the subject.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But then, what is ‘Enomoto-san-like’?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s the difference between Enomoto-san and Himari?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hair length? Eye color? Height? Uh, the size of her… chest…?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, that’s not it. Those are universal, objective differences. They’re just numbers when said out loud.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What then represents Enomoto-san’s uniqueness? Sweets?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The occasional sense of intimidation she exudes?</p>
<p class="calibre5">The cool demeanor that’s really just shyness around new people?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…The Queen of the Night.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, that came to mind. The flower accessory on her left wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To me, that’s everything about Enomoto-san. The white flower that blooms for just a few hours at midnight.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The flower I’d stay up watching, not wanting to sleep, just for that brief encounter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">How can I capture this in a photo?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s no good if I’m the only one aware of it. I need to convey it to the model.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But how? Well, I can only give verbal instructions…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, I want to capture the Queen of the Night.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The Queen of the Night?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san shows the accessory on her left wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Yeah, I guess that would be the response.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Not like that, I mean, I want to capture you as if you were the Queen of the Night… Ah, I’m not talking about the pose…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…? …??”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san is completely confused with ‘What is he saying?’ kind of look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yeah, I’d think the same. In fact, it’s too kind of Enomoto-san to immediately try to pose like the Queen of the Night.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, forget what I just said… Is there no more time? I’ll think about it over the weekend. If it’s okay, let’s have another photo session like this on Monday…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was planning to get to work this weekend, but it can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The main Instagram photo session is on the first day of Golden Week, so there is some leeway in the production period…</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I’m calculating the schedule in my head, Himari suddenly says,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s irritating when things aren’t clear.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both Enomoto-san and I turn around at the same time. There was Himari, smiling brightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Such a beautiful smile that it made you wonder if her previous foul language was just an auditory hallucination.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, just hold your phone like that, and stay still.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“O-Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari walks up to Enomoto-san. She whispers something in her ear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That was the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san’s eyes widen in surprise. She turns to look at me.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_10.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">“───!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I tap the shutter button as my finger moves reflexively.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The sound of the shutter beeps, capturing the moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">[Image00016]</p>

<p class="calibre5">It really happened in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then silence fell upon us. None of the three of us tried to move, and nobody said a word.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I stared at the photo in astonishment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Miraculously, it wasn’t blurry. It was as if a piece of film from a movie had been cut out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">How should I describe her expression?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not the expression of ‘love’.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I had to say, it was a desperate expression.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Eyes wide open, an atmosphere of clinging onto something.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can see the anticipation of continuing to chase something, almost reaching it in the next moment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, her mouth, as if denying that expectation, was biting her lip with an anxious feeling.</p>

<p class="calibre5">A complex emotion was visible, but I certainly thought it was the ‘Queen of the Night.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The language of the flowers for the Queen of the Night is ‘Glamorous Beauty’, ‘Fleeting Love’ and ‘Just once, I Wish to See You’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Perhaps when faced with a once-in-a-lifetime encounter, people would make such a face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or maybe Orihime and Hikoboshi, who are allowed to meet just once a year on the night of Tanabata, would join hands with such expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was perfect.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not the expression of love, but you can certainly feel ‘love.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow. Enomoto-san, this is amazing… hm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san, who had just shown an acting worthy of an actress, was now looking at me with a face as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s wrong? Is she dissatisfied with my reaction?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, can’t help it. When people are truly overwhelmed, they just loss at words.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san, is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Because, Yuu-kun. W-With Hi-chan…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With Himari?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I look towards Himari. For some reason, Himari was giving Enomoto-san a cold look.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When she noticed me watching, she immediately shrugged her shoulders with a ‘heh’ as if joking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then Himari lightly tapped the nearly crying Enomoto-san on the shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Enocchi. It’s just a joke♪”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san stared intently at that smiling face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For a moment, a tremendous amount of emotions passed over it. Once they settled, Enomoto-san’s temples began to twitch.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, she let out a scream that seemed to shake the science lab.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. Enocchi, your reacion is so honest.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Realizing she was being teased, Enomoto-san hastily picked up a chair.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hi-chan! I really hate you!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa!? Enocchi, that’s definitely something a girl shouldn’t do!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s Hi-chan’s fault! I’ll return all the grudges I’ve held until now!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But it looks like Yuu is totally satisfied thanks to that, so it’s good, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san froze for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She slowly lowered the chair she had lifted. Then she looked at me anxiously.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yuu-kun. The photo is…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s perfect. Absolutely adorable. Please do the same for the actual shoot.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I showed a thumbs-up with a bit more enthusiasm than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My response was overly enthusiastic because Himari’s life depended on it, but the words were undoubtedly sincere.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There couldn’t be a better ‘love’ model than this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then Enomoto-san’s cheeks relaxed like mochi in ozoni soup.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I, I see… ehehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wow, she’s so sweet.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it okay to be so easily swayed with that pretty face? Won’t you get tricked by some weird guy in the future?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not my place to say, but I’m seriously worried.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san glanced at her watch with a start.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, the tuning has started! I need to go now!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, thank you for your hard work.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san grabbed her bag, waving her hands briskly, and left the science lab.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Watching her leave, Himari came over.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Show me the photo, too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I showed her the phone, and she nodded in satisfaction.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nfufu. Enocchi is cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Honestly, it’s amazing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I even want to edit in a flower accessory and post this picture.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But that would be against the rules… Besides, I feel a little reluctant to show it to everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a photo that inadvertently stirred a desire to have it all to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. What did you say to her?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm. It’s a secret♡”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It must have been something no good. Looking at Himari’s dazzling smile, I thought so.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Now, all that’s left is to finish the flower accessory and then visit Enocchi’s house.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. Thanks to Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course. Yuu, you should appreciate me more.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I really am always being helped by Himari…Well, she’s also always increasing my workload.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Have you decided what kind of accessory you’re going to make?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll make it a hairpin.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wow, that was a quick answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“With this picture, a close-up of the face would be best. It was a choice between earrings or a hairpin, but Enomoto-san has beautiful hair, so hairpin would be better for her.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then a red tulip would be nice. It suits Enocchi too.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">A red tulip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The language of flowers means ‘A declaration of love.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">There are different meanings for the language of flowers depending on the color, but indeed, red fits this expression perfectly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">From tomorrow, I’ll start the real work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I need to source the tulips for the performance, prepare the equipment, and make the accessories for sale.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I was getting ready for that, Himari suddenly spoke to me,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Make one for me too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What do you want?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari was staring at me intently, twirling a lock of hair near her ear with her finger.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A ‘love’ flower accessory. One for me oo.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“For Himari?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah. For when I fall in love someday… Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At those words, I inadvertently averted my gaze. The twinflower choker around Himari’s neck seemed to sparkle faintly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a failed piece with bubbles in the resin, something that couldn’t even be sold as a product.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet Himari had taken good care of it and was still wearing it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…This choker contains the air from two years ago when we first met.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s filled with all the feelings from when I was shaken by Himari’s friendship, when we shared a dream, and when I vowed to cherish this best friend for life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To me, it’s the most precious thing in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It is inviolable, unbreakable, irreplaceable. The mere possibility that it could be anything else is intolerable to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I respond like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…That’s impossible. You are my best friend after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was a moment of cold silence, but it was so brief it might have been only my imagination and then Himari smiled wryly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I guess so.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Besides, aren’t you going to help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh. The wound Enocchi inflicted earlier still hurts…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Aren’t your excuses a bit too flimsy? You don’t even have a scratch.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I can’t say that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For a moment, I wanted to take a picture of Himari, who said she wanted a ‘love’ accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Did she realize it? While pretending to joke as usual, her cheeks were dyed a vivid crimson.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She pulled her short hair, trying to unconsciously hide her reddened cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her beautiful marine-blue eyes were moist as if she was expecting something from me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to have that expression all to myself, regardless of the accessory.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t say it. There’s no way I can.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Because that’s not a feeling meant for a best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wanting her all to myself…that’s not friendship, it’s something different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no romance between me and Himari. That’s been the promise since our second year of middle school.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Lately, my best friend has been so cute… and it’s causing me a little trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…That’s impossible. You’re my best friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu said that.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His attitude was curt. He wouldn’t even look at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was busy putting away some equipment as if that was more important, but I wanted him to look at me right now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yet, Yuu was only looking at the trial version of the tulips.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The ones that Enocchi had been wearing until just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They still retained her warmth, a reminder of his first love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, I’ve been rejected&mdash;&mdash;That’s what I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I meant it as a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted him to respond like he always did with ‘That wouldn’t suit you’ so that I could retort with ‘I don’t want to hear that from you, Yuu’.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those words just slipped out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right. I’m the best friend, aren’t I?</p>
<p class="calibre5">This whole week. Yuu never tried to cross that line.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…And yet, maybe I haven’t thought of us as just friends for a long time now.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The incident at the flower shop was not good. I saw the expression of love on Yuu’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He never looked at me with that expression. The thought that there was a Yuu I didn’t know felt strangely painful.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought Yuu belonged to me, but I was made to realize that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought I knew everything about Yuu, but that arrogance was thrown back in my face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to see that expression up close.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted that serious gaze to be directed at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I realized that I didn’t just like Yuu when he was making his flower accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I just wanted his passionate, marble-like burning gaze to reflect me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Maybe that’s why I was modeling for Yuu’s accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I was the first to wear them, he would direct that passionate gaze at me. But it wasn’t really meant for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The friendship we built, our relationship, it seems to obstruct us from moving forward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what’s most unbearable. But also irreplaceable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s everything about our two years together, like a bag packed with both joys and hardships.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, to move beyond, I had to let go of it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not being able to let go was the cause of all failures.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This whole week, I always had an escape route ready. If I failed, I made sure I could go back to being just best friends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I lost.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Rather, it’s more accurate to say I had no intention to win.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I’m not the kind of person who can bet all in on a game I might lose.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I guess it’ll never change. This poison in my heart, named the spirit of a loser, will surely continue to kill my future slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why I have to play it smart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I can’t gain anything more, at the very least, I mustn’t lose anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I must keep this bag of friendship between us safe from being taken by anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To remain Yuu’s best friend, all I have to do is endure a little bit more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It was only a week after this prototype photo session that I was painfully made aware that this was already the thinking of a loser.</p>
