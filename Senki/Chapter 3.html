<h1>Chapter 3: New Malice</h1>



<p> <br />“Kirido Hashiru”…right?<br /> <br />The boy had his legs up on the desk in poor posture, gazing out the window.<br /> <br />Students leaving school bit by bit.<br /> <br />As he watched their backs, the boy raised the corners of his mouth in a bow.<br /> <br />“Who would’ve thought the first expulsion would come from Class C?”<br /> <br />He returned his gaze to the classroom interior.<br /> <br />Despite it being after school, not a single student tried to leave that classroom—Class 1-A. The boy stood up from his chair and headed for the teacher’s podium.<br /> <br />There his classmate was, tied to a chair and rendered unable to speak.<br /> <br />The boy punched that classmate, sending him flying.<br /> <br />The dull, vivid sound of impact and spurting blood. Stifled screams leaked from the classroom.<br /> <br />However, the boy alone had an unclouded smile on his face.<br /> <br />A cheerful, innocent childlike smile.<br /> <br />With madness in his eyes, he grabbed a fistful of hair of his classmate who had fallen over chair and all.<br /> <br />“I thought the first expulsion would come from this class!”<br /> <br />That boy—Nagashi Netsuhara—wore a hideous, malice-filled smile.<br /> <br />That boy was unpopular, friendless. He had no heart to care about others.<br /> <br />But he had malice and violence. He had enough power to silence the entire class.<br /> <br />And he had been blessed with a Divine Protection Ability.<br /> <br />Thus, in a single day he had completely brought Class A under his control.<br /> <br />“Now then! I’m gonna beat this guy up, but anyone with complaints, raise your hand! If you can beat me, I’ll happily hand over this position!”<br /> <br />The class center. The leader’s spot. The throne of king—it was obvious that the individual, Nagashi, now stood in that place despite no one desiring it.<br /> <br />But that was only natural.<br /> <br />The unprecedented major incident on the first day of P.E. where he alone defeated all his classmates.<br /> <br />Though he had imposed an oath of silence so rumors wouldn’t spread, that incident had clearly displayed his power.<br /> <br />—We can’t win even if we all go at him at once.<br /> <br />The deep-seated fear engraved in everyone’s minds at times became peerless ‘control’.<br /> <br />“Heh.”<br /> <br />As if he saw through them, Nagashi laughed.<br /> <br />His gaze turned to the fallen student, then soon filled with madness as if set aflame.<br /> <br />“Class C huh… I wonder who it was. The one who got Kirido expelled.”<br /> <br />And thus, madness chose its target.<br /> <br />However, no one yet knew.<br /> <br />That the one he aimed his spear at was also—exceptionally mad.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />About a week had passed since Kirido Hashiru’s expulsion.<br /> <br />It’s not like nothing happened in that time but…well, there were no major occurrences.<br /> <br />If there were, it was stuff like a classmate violating school rules and getting fined, or Amamori making Asahina san cry again, or changing seats. That level of stuff.<br /> <br />By the way, my seat changed to the very back by the window. Originally where Kirido had sat.<br /> <br />“Haa…”<br /> <br />“Hm? What’s with the sigh?”<br /> <br />Hearing a cheerful voice, I turned around to see Umaru Fuyuji.<br /> <br />Permed brown hair and features as orderly as to make any girl fall for him instantly at a glance. Though he was overshadowed because some idiot went wild on the first day, he was now firmly at the top of the class hierarchy…but this guy talks to me every day. I wonder if it’s really that fun for a loner like him to talk to an introvert.<br /> <br />While thinking that, I answered his question with my chin on my palm.<br /> <br />“Nah, just a little tired.”<br /> <br />“Ahh…I see.”<br /> <br />Saying that, Umaru turned his gaze forward.<br /> <br />When I was pulled to look too, Kurashiki and Asahina san had serious expressions, talking to each other. And Asahina san’s face was the picture of seriousness. She seemed to be taking notes too…I’ve got a bad feeling about this.<br /> <br />—Kurashiki Hotaru. Her role is to gain complete trust.<br /> <br />More bluntly, to become best friends with Asahina Kasumi. Supporting her by her side and leading the class with trust. Becoming the other pillar of mental support for Class 1-C, so to speak.<br /> <br />I had already conveyed that to Kurashiki. At that time, I slipped up in kindness and said ‘You can even use me if you want’—and that was fatal.<br /> <br />“There’s really no other way, Hotaru-san! I want to get along better with Amamori-kun!”<br /> <br />“Calm down, Kasumi-chan. Actually, I thought up several ways to get through to Amamori-kun! I want to try some of them out today!”<br /> <br />I heard their conversation and I surely made a face like a pickled plum.<br /> <br />But as usual, only a blank expression was reflected in the window glass, making me sigh even more.<br /> <br />Somehow they were on casual name terms, and she seemed to be smoothly carrying out my request, but…this is super annoying. Was there really no better method, Kurashiki?<br /> <br />“That’s what this is about, right? Amamori’s got a tough supporting role too. Unlucky to get a weak Ability, unlucky to be put in a class with idiots. And then unlucky to be in the same class as Asahina-san… Well, the last one would’ve been lucky if not for the first two.”<br /> <br />“Well…I won’t deny that.”<br /> <br />Won’t affirm it either.<br /> <br />Whether he knew my true feelings or not, he said this rather ‘loudly’:<br /> <br />“So how’s it going in reality? Your relations with the two big beauties of the class?”<br /> <br />At those words, Asahina san’s shoulders visibly shook.<br /> <br />…This guy said it at just the right volume to be ‘audible’ from the classroom edge. Look, Asahina san who had a serious expression earlier is glancing this way with a red face. Are you a maiden in love?<br /> <br />“Let’s see… For Kurashiki-san, above acquaintances but below friends?<br /> <br />“Then Asahina-san is…”<br /> <br />“Huh? Who’s that? Was there a girl like that?”<br /> <br />The moment I said that, Asahina deflated, and Umaru among others pressed their hands to their foreheads with sad voices saying ‘Oh…’<br /> <br />“Are you…serious?”<br /> <br />“What are you saying, Umaru Fuyuji? I’m confident I remember all our classmates’ names, top and bottom. The only ones I wouldn’t remember are those I don’t have a shred of interest in.”<br /> <br />“I-I see… Yes, I knew, Asahina Kasumi. I’m just so disliked by Amamori-kun it’s beyond normal… Yes, that’s all it is…”<br /> <br />“Hey, Kasumi-chan…! Amamori-kun! How many times do I have to tell you to recognize Asahina-san?!”<br /> <br />I could hear the voices of the so-called two big beauties from afar.<br /> <br />But of course, ignored.<br /> <br />Staring straight at Umaru, he scratched his cheek looking troubled.<br /> <br />“This is bad… I was pretty confident in my ability to discern lies from truth. Seeing you makes me lose confidence.”<br /> <br />“Is that so? Work hard.”<br /> <br />“Hahaha…even with a straight face like that.”<br /> <br />As we were talking, it was already one minute before homeroom started.<br /> <br />Kurashiki came back to her seat—in other words, the seat in front of me, next to Umaru—and puffed her cheeks glaring at me. Oh how cute.<br /> <br />“Be prepared! I’m definitely going to make you get along with Asahina-san!”<br /> <br />“Nah, who’s this guy you’re talking about?”<br /> <br />“She’s a girl! At least get their gender right!”<br /> <br />A few classmates laughed at Kurashiki’s retort.<br /> <br />Umaru was among them, wiping tears from his eyes as he said:<br /> <br />“Yeah, you really are close friends!”<br /> <br />What part of this seems friendly, I thought.<br /> </p>










<p> <br />“Say, are we close friends?”<br /> <br />“We’re not, but at least we look like ‘President’ and friend right?”<br /> <br />After school. Kurashiki sitting smugly in the classroom I ‘rented’ for a year at 300,000 yen.<br /> <br />Hey, what about club? Weren’t you in track and field? I was about to say that when I turned my gaze out the window—lo and behold, pouring rain. Looks like club activities are out.<br /> <br />She had her legs up on the desk at the window seat, busily tapping away at a smartphone game.<br /> <br />Her white legs stretching out from under her skirt are poison for the e…what did you think I’d say? Unfortunately I have zero interest. I glanced for a bit of course since I’m a guy though, right?<br /> <br />“So, how’s it going?”<br /> <br />“Oh, pretty well I think? For now—<br /> <br />‘Even though things turned out like that… I’ll help Asahina-san! Operation get Amamori-kun to be friends, it’ll be pretty tough but…don’t worry! Brace yourself like you’re on a lifeboat!<br /> <br />‘Ah, Kurashiki san, I think it’s large ship not lifeboat?’<br /> <br />‘Huh, oh right, a large ship! Brace yourself like on a large ship!’<br /> <br />‘Yes, I understand. Thank you, Kurashiki-san.’<br /> <br />‘Mou! Call me Hotaru!’<br /> <br />‘O-Okay? Then you can call me—’ …We’re at about that level!”<br /> <br />Ugh, what a conversation that makes me envision the scene.<br /> <br />I looked at Kurashiki as if saying ‘What is this communication monster…’ Misunderstanding something, she lightly pulled up her skirt and twisted her lips as if to tease.<br /> <br />“Oh my, even the expressionless guy can’t take his eyes off a high school girl’s bare legs?”<br /> <br />“Huh? All I saw was ‘What is this monster wearing the skin of a high school girl?’ Sorry.”<br /> <br />“I’ll kill you, bastard.”<br /> <br />Haha, as if you could kill me. Go train for a hundred years then come back.<br /> <br />Without voicing those feelings, I casually dragged over a chair and sat down across from Kurashiki over the desk.<br /> <br />“So, so. Let’s get to the main issue.”<br /> <br />“The main issue… So it means you’ll finally start moving too?”<br /> <br />Well…I guess so? Outwardly I still don’t plan on moving at all, but our classmates’ ‘assessment’ of me should be about over too.<br /> <br />“Kurashiki. Do you remember the ‘comrades’ I said I would gather?”<br /> <br />“‘A talent who can stand beside Asahina and lead the class together’ and ‘A puppet and facade for Amamori Yuuto’… That’s right, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, exactly.”<br /> <br />From here on, I’ll have Asahina Kasumi stand at the front. And for that, I need two people.<br /> </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/00011.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>One is someone who can stand beside Asahina san and lead the class together—Kurashiki Hotaru.<br /> <br />And the other is someone who can be my puppet and facade. In other words, the one pulling the strings behind Asahina.<br /> <br />“When someone realizes there’s someone behind Asahina, the one they’ll suspect without hesitation. Someone intelligent with strong abilities who isn’t in the spotlight, preferably taciturn.”<br /> <br />“Don’t make such difficult requests. I personally thought Umaru would be good, but…he’s out since he’s too much in the spotlight.”<br /> <br />Right. If someone already in the spotlight was revealed as ‘the one pulling Asahina’s strings all along!’ it would raise suspicions like ‘Why didn’t you just do it yourself? No need to stand behind someone right?’ That’s why it absolutely has to be someone originally unrelated to the spotlight.<br /> <br />“Well, it’d be case closed if you just openly pulled the strings behind instead of making a facade, but…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’d rather not do that.”<br /> <br />It’s not impossible in terms of ability. Rather, it would probably go much more smoothly if I directly took that position. However.<br /> <br />“It’s easier to move around with a facade.”<br /> <br />Ultimately, that alone is reason enough.<br /> <br />If I took that position, I’d be recognized by at least some of the ‘smart guys’ to a certain degree. And I’d definitely be marked.<br /> <br />Then it would become difficult to manufacture evidence like with Kirido… And most of all, if a foe appears who I have to get serious against, I won’t be able to move freely—that would be a problem. …However, contrary to my thoughts, Kurashiki squinted.<br /> <br />“Nah, you just dislike Asahina.”<br /> <br />Since Kurashiki said something so awful, I sadly lowered my eyes and answered.<br /> <br />“That’s terrible, I love Asahina a lot.”<br /> <br />“Ew, your most obvious lie ever.”<br /> <br />Don’t say things like that! Even if it’s true, there are some things you shouldn’t say out loud!<br /> <br />Yes, even if it’s the truth! It’s important so I’ll say it twice!<br /> <br />Ignoring her words, I returned the conversation to the main track with my usual blank expression.<br /> <br />“Anyway, in any case. Leave scouting for the puppet role to me. I’ve already found a promising prospect. All that’s left is to contact him and gauge what kind of guy he is.”<br /> <br />Well, that’s the hardest part, and it’s most likely I’ll end up with ‘Nope, this guy’s no good’ after learning his true nature… However, there can be no compromise whatsoever regarding this matter.<br /> <br />“Kurashiki, please continue working on Asahina. Once we successfully get a new comrade on this end, I’ll have you mediate between that guy and Asahina too.”<br /> <br />Saying that, I glanced at her.<br /> <br />Kurashiki was there gazing steadily at me with a serious expression.<br /> <br />“You won’t tell me the ‘collaborator’ who framed Kirido, yet you say that so easily.”<br /> <br />That’s…well, you’re right about that. But that collaborator’s greatest desire is to ‘not reveal their true identity to anyone’. Since they’re cooperating with me, I can’t break that verbal promise. Trust is important.<br /> <br />“So? Who’s this new guy you’re gonna bring in?”<br /> <br />Kurashiki suddenly asked.<br /> <br />Strong curiosity was visible in her eyes as I casually turned my gaze out the window.<br /> <br />Many students walked home under umbrellas in the pouring rain. Amidst the colors filling the road, I spotted a boy holding a black umbrella.<br /> <br />Feeling my gaze, the boy glanced back toward the school building.<br /> <br />Of course our eyes didn’t actually meet but… Looking beside me, Kurashiki who had watched him over my shoulder scowled exaggeratedly.<br /> <br />“There’s no way you’d pick that gloomy guy, right?”<br /> <br />That’s how she ridiculed the male student.<br /> <br />With slightly long black hair and black eyes dark as obsidian.<br /> <br />Tall, features so excellent that ten out of ten people would turn to look.<br /> <br />However, he had no sociability, and I didn’t recall ever seeing him converse with anyone in class.<br /> <br />“As a girl shouldn’t you be glad he’s a hunk?”<br /> <br />“He’s too gloomy for that… He’s got the eyes of a girl who got raped or something.”<br /> <br />“Young ladies shouldn’t say such things.”<br /> <br />I immediately retorted, but Kurashiki didn’t care which way the wind blew.<br /> <br />I returned my gaze to the boy. Tilting his head as if sensing my stare, he once again set off on his way home. He didn’t look back again, and I saw him off as he left.<br /> <br />—His name is Kurotsuki kanade. The boy who is the first candidate for Amamori Yuuto’s puppet role…<br /> <br />“He ranked a proud ‘third place’ among all the applicants on the academy’s entrance exam. And while not as stellar as his academic scores, his physical test results were quite high-ranking too. In short, he’s what you’d call a genius.”<br /> <br />Saying that, I handed Kurashiki the entrance exam result sheet.<br /> <br />Seeing the high scores he’d achieved, her eyes widened dramatically.<br /> <br />“Wha—?! What the hell are these scores!? Going around in a circle, isn’t this guy an idiot? Asahina ranked eighth and she’s… Come to think of it, I wanna know who the two who outscored this guy are!”<br /> <br />“Sorry. I only have Class C.”<br /> <br />The result sheet with names sorted by high score.<br /> <br />The names of students outside Class C were blotted out in black pen, leaving only our classmates’ names viewable. Well, my name was erased too since it’s embarrassing to show.<br /> <br />“And how the hell did you get this…”<br /> <br />“I contacted him first. Recognize how excellent that is.”<br /> <br />Kurashiki Hotaru was more outstanding than I’d anticipated.<br /> <br />But the first person I brought into my circle wasn’t her.<br /> <br />Just saying that much should make her infer various things.<br /> <br />Whether her inferences are right or wrong is another matter though.<br /> <br />“The mysterious collaborator huh. With access like this, some kind of hacking Ability?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, something like that.”<br /> <br />Maybe a lie though. I hid that thought and stood up from my chair.<br /> <br />Kurashiki too returned her gaze out the window.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki had passed through the school gates and soon disappeared from view.<br /> <br />“…That guy looks gloomy.”<br /> <br />“That’s why he’s good. Optimal.”<br /> <br />With overwhelming abilities. Physical and mental specs both top class in the grade.<br /> <br />And yet he doesn’t try to stand out. Having all of that makes him perfect.<br /> <br />Which means, I need to investigate Kurotsuki kanade further.<br /> <br />What does he want by not standing out?<br /> <br />And what can I give to make him lend me his strength?<br /> <br />It’d be nice if his direction was similar to Kurashiki’s from the start but…<br /> <br />“Well, it probably won’t be that simple.”<br /> <br />Kurashiki seemed to agree as she looked up at me with restless eyes.<br /> <br />“Any plans?”<br /> <br />“Take it slowly. But at the very least, I’ll decide by the time Asahina makes her move.”<br /> <br />Whether to make him an ally or not.<br /> <br />Leaving me at that, Kurashiki, seeming to have lost interest, picked up her bag.<br /> <br />“Well, that works for me. Don’t worry, I’ll just abandon you if you fail. Take your time thinking hard. …I’ll be over here observing as a third party.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, leave Kurotsuki to me.”<br /> <br />Hearing my words, Kurashiki left the room.<br /> <br />I saw her off, then pictured the situation in my head.<br /> <br />Our class’s current circumstances, my standing, Kurotsuki’s stance.<br /> <br />And inferences about other classes’ situations and future developments.<br /> <br />After lining it all up and piecing it together, I opened my eyes.<br /> <br />“…Well. Things will work out, I suppose.”<br /> <br />And so I too set off to return today.<br /> <br />I was tired today. I’ll get serious starting tomorrow.<br /> <br />I naively thinking such things.<br /> </p>


<p> <br />It’s sudden, but I’m bad with P.E. class.<br /> <br />It’s not that I can’t keep up. Just, I have nothing but ‘bad memories’ between getting punched by Kirido, probed about my Ability by Kurashiki, and clung to by Asahina san… So every Tuesday for P.E., and any other irregular classes inevitably put me on edge.<br /> <br />“Now then, this is our third P.E. class.”<br /> <br />Teacher Sakaki, in white coat, told Class C as a whole.<br /> <br />“On the first class, you learned of abilities’ fearsome nature through the now-expelled Kirido and Amamori there. On the second, we measured your basic physical strength and foundational abilities based on that experience. And on the third, today, we will begin ability-focused training.”<br /> <br />At those words, my classmates stirred.<br /> <br />No small number had enrolled in this academy for its abilities. While that certainly wasn’t all of them, interest in abilities did make up a large portion.<br /> <br />“Some are already participating in club activities, but recruitment aimed at new students will begin in earnest next week. And at the same time this year, Conflict Requests will be permitted.”<br /> <br />“Conflict…?”<br /> <br />“She means Confrontation, Amamori-kun.”<br /> <br />When I tilted my head at the unfamiliar term, Kurashiki had come up beside me somehow. And Asahina san was clinging next to her, so it irritated me.<br /> <br />“So uh, what’s this…Conflict thing?”<br /> <br />Since I wasn’t interested, I hadn’t looked into the academy’s systems and events much. So I asked Kurashiki. Though the answer came from someone else.<br /> <br />“It’s Confrontation, Duel, Amamori-kun! Conflicts—Confrontation, Duel Requests are one of the systems permitted to the students at this academy. You decide on rules and contents with the opponent you requested confrontation with, and determine superiority through competition. It’s probably what the teachers here value most!”<br /> <br />“…I see, thanks Asahina-san.”<br /> <br />“Huh? My name feels mistaken somehow, but could it be…this is the first time Amamori-kun has thanked me…!”<br /> <br />While she seemed happy about that, Asahina-san’s case seemed rather dire… Glancing at Kurashiki, she also looked troubled, with an ‘Ahaha…’<br /> <br />“Confrontation Requests are considered important in every aspect. Of course the contents range widely from games to brawls, but amidst those, all ‘school rules’ are exempted.”<br /> <br />Teacher Sakaki’s voice rang out again.<br /> <br />I don’t really get it, but basically if you do that ‘Conflict’ thing, it seems you can do any actions restricted by school rules in normal situations…like, you know. Fighting and stuff.<br /> <br />As if affirming my thoughts, Teacher Sakaki’s voice echoed.<br /> <br />“Most have likely realized at this point, but the form of battle most frequently carried out in these competitions is none other than [Ability Battles]. Confrontations using abilities to fight.”<br /> <br />And that connects back to the earlier talk.<br /> <br />Looking around at my classmates, there were those brimming with confidence in their success, those getting excited recalling their own strength, and those clouding their faces in anxiety… Well, just at a glance I could see several patterns. However, a few still wore their usual expressionless faces.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki was naturally one of them.<br /> </p>

<p>As I was surveying those faces, I suddenly felt Kurashiki’s sharp gaze from beside me.<br /> <br />“Hm? What’s up Amamori-kun?”<br /> <br />“Nah, it’s nothing.”<br /> <br />She asserts I’m assessing them. As I convince myself of the meaning behind her gaze, Teacher Sakaki’s explanation just finished.—However.<br /> <br />“Now then, pair up in twos and begin ability training.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />I felt like the teacher just said the four words I least wanted to hear right now.<br /> <br />Pair up in twos… Did she really say that? My vision darkened in despair.<br /> <br />With Kirido gone, our class had twenty-nine students total.<br /> <br />In short, there was one left over.<br /> <br />Let me say it again, there was one left over.<br /> <br />“Ah, Amamori-k—”<br /> <br />“Asahina-saaan! Hey, let’s pair up!”<br /> <br />“No fair! I’ll pair with you!”<br /> <br />“Oh, me too, me too!”<br /> <br />Asahina who tried to talk to me was swallowed up by the mixed group of boys and girls, and before long she was out of sight. Good, I’ll allow it.<br /> <br />I try to quickly look for Kurashiki, but somehow she had disappeared from my side.<br /> <br />Glancing around, I discovered her joining a group of girls in the distance saying “Hey, will someone pair with me?” Her crisis perception skills are way too high.<br /> <br />Giving them a once-over, I mutter in my heart, “Welp, gotta find a partner!”<br /> <br />Hm? You thought I wouldn’t actually mutter it?<br /> <br />Sorry, but I don’t have any friends.<br /> <br />On second thought, I don’t have confidence in properly conversing with anyone but Kurashiki. Asahina is out of the question, and…maybe barely Umaru? Though he was already getting friendly with the top dogs of the class hierarchy. In the end, I’m alone.<br /> <br />So, with that whole situation—<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I see, so you’re the one left.”<br /> <br />“Yeah…”<br /> <br />Of course I’m left over. I knew it.<br /> <br />My grades are average. My eyes are dead and there’s not a shred of vigor in my face.<br /> <br />Plus my Ability is weak, an utterly ordinary guy without a single noteworthy trait. On top of that, the incident with Kirido made me stand out in a bad way. There’s a kind of atmosphere in the class now of ‘Amamori Yuuto, the guy who’s hard to talk to.’<br /> <br />So I was left over.<br /> <br />“I see. Well, that’s reasonable.”<br /> <br />You don’t have to say it’s reasonable.<br /> <br />My classmates had already started training in pairs around me.<br /> <br />Asahina was with some female student over there. Kurashiki seemed to have paired with a taciturn-looking girl. I guess Asahina just went with whoever, while Kurashiki as president paired with someone leftover like her.<br /> <br />“Now then, Amamori…I’ll be your pair. That said, I don’t know how to train your Ability.”<br /> <br />Let me say upfront, she knows my true strength.<br /> <br />That’s simply because she’s my homeroom teacher.<br /> <br />The homeroom teacher knows every student’s ‘real’ Ability. …Though it seems she doesn’t know other classes’ students. Yes, I heard from a trustworthy source.<br /> <br />…But it’s odd. My Ability should even be registered in the academy’s database as [Eyesight Ruiner]. So how did she trace that back to my real ability?<br /> <br />It’s worrying, but this isn’t the time to investigate. Convincing myself of that, I opened my mouth.<br /> <br />“Um, how exactly do you strengthen abilities?”<br /> <br />“That’s simple. Use them. The more you use them, the more skilled you become, and they’ll gradually strengthen.”<br /> <br />It’s just like a game. As I muttered internally, Teacher Sakaki said “It’s just like a game.”<br /> <br />Good thing I didn’t say it out loud. I almost double booked. Though I feel like our wording was a bit different. Well, no use fussing over minor details.<br /> <br />“Your power is an unprecedented heterodoxy even looking back through history… Honestly, faced with that uniqueness, I have no advice or anything, but the key is that your power has already reached its complete form. In that case, I believe you should focus on improving your technique over your Ability.”<br /> <br />—Complete form. Hearing her say that, I smiled wryly.<br /> <br />“I see. You’re right, I should prioritize that.”<br /> <br />“Oh right, you were spouting some nonsense about [Eyesight Ruiner] or whatever wasn’t it? Clean up your own lies, I don’t know anything.”<br /> <br />She said that then averted her gaze, so I was relieved.<br /> <br />I don’t really want to talk about my real Ability and stuff… She might let something about my Ability slip by accident.<br /> <br />“Then, independent training it is.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, just sit over there and practice.”<br /> <br />Told that, I sat down on the nearby stairs and grabbed my left arm with my right palm.<br /> <br />“Now then.”<br /> <br />Unexpectedly, I had ended up with this time.<br /> <br />I was training, but had nothing to do besides that.<br /> <br />With that, the things I could do became limited.<br /> <br />“Let’s see… Oh, found one.”<br /> </p>







<p><br />Among my classmates training their abilities as Teacher Sakaki directed, I spotted a tall figure and fixed my gaze on Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />He had…paired up with another leftover probably. He was paired with an unpopular male student, looking like bocchi from the side.<br /> <br />But the reason he wasn’t seen as ‘bocchi’ like me was likely his excellent looks. And that he had strong abilities.<br /> <br />“Kurotsuki! Show a bit of your power, one of the top ability users in class—!”<br /> <br />I could hear Teacher Sakaki’s voice from afar.<br /> <br />Looking, Kurotsuki’s brows were slightly furrowed, but he probably didn’t intend to defy the teacher.<br /> <br />Silently, he held up his right hand forward.<br /> <br />And then—a [Magic Circle] manifested in thin air.<br /> <br />“I see. So that’s…”<br /> <br />Seeing his ability like this, I could feel how tremendous it was.<br /> <br />What appeared from the magic circle were crimson flames.<br /> <br />The tremendously powerful flames shot forth, searing the grounds, gouging deeply, causing explosions.<br /> <br />The blast blew back Kurotsuki’s bangs.<br /> <br />The exposed eyes…somehow looked despairing.<br /> <br />“[Divine Protection of the Devil King]…an Ability to use any and all magic.”<br /> <br />A Divine Protection Ability. In other words, equal to Asahina and Kurashiki.<br /> <br />And the terrifying thing was that power.<br /> <br />I would call his Ability ‘omnipotent’.<br /> <br />Since his Ability lets him use any and all magic-categorized things, it’s a rule-breaking one.<br /> <br />“If I had to pick, it’d be him right.”<br /> <br />And he was a true genius.<br /> <br />He showed no sign of effort whatsoever. He doesn’t even properly listen in class. And he’s clearly slacking in P.E. too. Yet he’s surely earning good grades.<br /> <br />Of course, he isn’t posting the foolish exam scores from entrance exams.<br /> <br />But it remains fact that he boasts the top grades in Class C while slacking off.<br /> <br />…However.<br /> <br />His back after finishing his magic somehow looked lonely.<br /> <br />Gifted with great talent and power, yet why did he make a face like that?<br /> <br />“Well, that’s interesting but…”<br /> <br />The problem is how to persuade him.<br /> <br />As I said before, what does he desire? What can I give to form a cooperative relationship? I need to think about that… However, as the greatest premise, first I need to get him to recognize me not just as a random classmate, but as the individual Amamori Yuuto.<br /> <br />At present, we’re still strangers who haven’t even talked. We couldn’t even hold a discussion.<br /> <br />So after getting him to recognize the individual Amamori Yuuto, I need to have something persuasive enough, be it theoretical armaments or even bribes.<br /> <br />—And at this point organizing my thoughts, I feel I was somewhat impatient.<br /> <br />…Damn. Since he seemed useful, I got ahead of myself.<br /> <br />I had completely forgotten what I should be thinking about first.<br /> <br />I stared at him again, and asked myself once more:<br /> </p>



<p> <br />—Is Kurotsuki kanade truly a suitable person?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I have to reconfirm that point.<br /> <br />He’s strong, talented, and meets the conditions.<br /> <br />But to what extent? How strong? How talented?<br /> <br />It’s easy to gloss over with a blanket statement of ‘potential,’ but that’s simply dangerous expectation.<br /> <br />No good if I don’t know at all. If I lack information, I have to gather it.<br /> <br />I have to gain enough information to turn expectation into conviction, or I can’t even start negotiation.<br /> <br />…And for that, this chance is deeply desirable.<br /> <br />“Now that you’re somewhat warmed up, we’ll begin mock battles for ‘Conflict requests’ from here.”<br /> <br />Over ten minutes later. Tension ran through the Class C students at Teacher Sakaki’s words.<br /> <br />“R-Right now…?”<br /> <br />“That’s right. As I said before, Conflict requests will soon be opened up. If you’ve done nothing but train without any actual experience by then, you’ll be easy pickings for the second and third-years, no?”<br /> <br />…She says it lightly, but we first-years will be targeted by the second and third-years?<br /> <br />From information I privately gathered, I feel like we first-years won’t be pushovers though.<br /> <br />Well, Teacher Sakaki probably knows that too… She’s probably choosing not to say it. Even if you’re wary of upperclassmen, you’ll only get your feet swept by classmates… She has an awful personality.<br /> <br />Smiling awfully before our gazes, the teacher held up her index finger.<br /> <br />“The important thing here is to not hold back.”<br /> <br />Kurashiki looks this way. Hey, stop that, don’t look this way.<br /> <br />Stubbornly keeping my eyes off her and on Teacher Sakaki, Kurashiki heaved a sigh and averted her gaze.<br /> <br />Instead, this time my eyes met precisely with Teacher Sakaki’s… Since Teacher Sakaki knows my real ability, her earlier words may have been directed at me.<br /> <br />But personally, I want them directed at Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />“Umm…why’s that, Teach?”<br /> <br />A light voice flew from the front. That just now was Umaru? In response to his question, Shake smiled a little.<br /> <br />“Let’s see. There will probably also be chances from here on to fight as a ‘class united’, not individuals. Things like ‘battles between classes with representative members’ for example. To be ready for times like that, it’d be good to have a solid grasp on who’s strong and who’s weak, right?”<br /> <br />“…I see. You’re certainly right.”<br /> <br />Teacher Sakaki gave a concrete example as she said that.<br /> <br />…So there probably are things like that huh.<br /> <br />Oh no. I’ve got a bad feeling my weakness will be exposed there and Asahina will approach me again. Maybe being the ‘weakest’ really is no good?<br /> <br />Should I aim for ordinary, neither weak nor strong? Is that what I should do?</p>

<p> <br />“That’s why, I’ll have you clearly define who’s strong and who’s weak!”<br /> <br />And with that, Teacher Sakaki smiled.<br /> <br />I smiled a little internally too since I’d finally get to see Kurotsuki’s true power.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />And then, a few minutes later—<br /> <br />“Please…tell me that was a joke.”<br /> <br />I twisted my cheeks internally at Kurotsuki standing before me as my ‘opponent’.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />What is this malicious joke?<br /> <br />I felt my cheeks twitch inwardly as I looked at Kurotsuki standing in front of me.<br /> <br />He had his hands shoved in his pockets, standing there looking composed.<br /> <br />Just standing there, he’s picture perfect since he’s an ikemen.<br /> <br />“Let’s see, the first match I arbitrarily decided will be Kurotsuki vs Amamori.”<br /> <br />“W-Wait Teach! What part of this is fair and equal?!”<br /> <br />As expected of Asahina san! Well said!<br /> <br />That’s right, I want to see Kurotsuki get serious!<br /> <br />There’s other students’ combat training too, so this’ll probably be Kurotsuki’s only match.<br /> <br />Yet the opponent is…me? That’s too harsh a joke, Teacher Sakaki.<br /> <br />If I fought, I’d just get insta-killed instantly.<br /> <br />It’s obvious I’d get insta-killed.<br /> <br />I can vividly imagine getting blasted by magic for a direct hit and immediate death.<br /> <br />“If it’s truly fair and equal, there should be a more suitable opponent for him!”<br /> <br />Asahina shouts.<br /> <br />At her words, my classmates stirred, and I clenched my fist.<br /> <br />Well said, Asahina!<br /> <br />We wanna see you two duke it out seriously, you know?<br /> <br />No one’s interested in ‘Amamori Gets Insta-Killed by Kurotsuki: The Picture’.<br /> <br />At most, Kurashiki would watch planning to joke about it later 100%.<br /> <br />So forget about me and start already, you two.<br /> <br />The strongest in class with her ability, Asahina Kasumi. The lone genius and lone wolf, Kurotsuki kanade.<br /> <br />I imagine an intense battle between you two.<br /> <br />And then Asahina cried out!<br /> <br />“I want to fight Amamori-kun myself!”<br /> <br />“Kurotsuki-kun, please go easy on me.”<br /> <br />I sincerely lowered my head to plead.<br /> <br />Sorry Kurotsuki-san, I was kinda unenthusiastic earlier.<br /> <br />Fighting you is definitely better than her. No really, I mean it.<br /> <br />Looking shocked, Asahina slumped over, while Sakaki smiled amusedly.<br /> <br />She probably thinks ‘Let those who secretary holding back beat each other up’. This devil.<br /> <br />“B-But…! Amamori-kun! L-Let’s train together! I think training with me would benefit Amamori-kun’s training nicely! I’ll work hard!”<br /> <br />“Um, who are you again? A student from another class?”<br /> <br />“Ugh—?!”<br /> <br />At my additional jab, Asahina finally collapsed face down.<br /> <br />While Kurashiki ran over exaggeratedly, I faced Kurotsuki again.<br /> <br />He was quietly watching me.<br /> <br />However…his eyes somehow seemed to be looking beyond me at something else.<br /> <br />“This is your chance to surrender.”<br /> <br />For the first time here, Kurotsuki spoke up…. His voice was tremendously good-looking.<br /> <br />A fawning shriek came from among the girls, and Kurotsuki grimaced in annoyance.<br /> <br />“I wanna surrender so bad but…doesn’t seem I can huh. If possible, I want you to go easy on me.”<br /> <br />“Understood. I’ll decide this in one blow.”<br /> <br />Sounding uninterested, Kurotsuki raised his right hand toward me.<br /> <br />Black energy (magic power or whatever) gathered in his right hand, and seeing that, Shake signaled.<br /> <br />“Then! Begin combat training!”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki moved almost simultaneously with the start signal sounding.<br /> <br />“Pierce, ‘Black Ball’.”<br /> <br />What was fired was a virtually undodgeable super-speed strike.<br /> <br />While the power seems modest, a direct hit would definitely knock me out.<br /> <br />Looking as if he’d lost interest, Kurotsuki cut his eyes off me.<br /> <br />Asahina reached out to me looking flustered.<br /> <br />—Defeat. That’s what we all thought, what I thought. I was certain I would absolutely lose.<br /> <br />Welp, I’d resolved myself to take the hit.<br /> <br />But I noticed. I noticed it.<br /> <br />…Oh, my shoelace is untied, I thought.<br /> <br />“Whoops.”<br /> <br />I crouched down and retied my shoelace.<br /> <br />The ‘Black Ball’ passed over my head as I did so.<br /> <br />“…………Huh?”<br /> <br />That doubtful voice came from Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />After retying my shoelace and looking up, he was gazing at me with widened, unbelieving eyes.<br /> <br />I wonder what’s wrong? I tilted my head and looked back.<br /> <br />The Black Ball had disappeared, stabbed into the ground.<br /> <br />Oh my, looks like by coincidence and happenstance, I miraculously dodged it.<br /> <br />This is bad. I was prepared to be insta-killed but…well, now that it’s come to this.<br /> <br />I should investigate as much as I can.<br /> <br />Just how strong this guy is.<br /> <br />—Whether he has the capacity to stand beside me.<br /> <br />I cracked my knuckles and focused on him.<br /> </p>

<p> <br />“Now, let’s fight, Kurotsuki kanade.”<br /> <br />At my words, Kurotsuki kanade froze for a short while.<br /> <br />Though thoughts like ‘Why, how, how are those words going through my head’ must be spinning through his brain, we’re in the middle of mock battle.<br /> <br />As a result, it seemed he had forcibly concluded his doubts.<br /> <br />“…Hmph, just got lucky.”<br /> <br />He raised his right hand again, unleashing an even bigger aura than before.<br /> <br />Uh oh, this’ll definitely kill me if it hits.<br /> <br />Sensing impending death, I started running around Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />Seeing me do that, Kurotsuki aimed.<br /> <br />“This time you won’t dodge, ‘Black Ball’!”<br /> <br />A Black Ball with a slightly louder voice than before. The power, size, and speed were all greater than earlier.<br /> <br />What an ability… I complained internally, but realized. I can’t dodge this one. Even with the human body, there’s no way I can dodge at this speed. It’s who knows how many times faster than Kirido, I thought.<br /> <br />While thinking that…I suddenly noticed.<br /> <br />I noticed it!<br /> <br />“Oh, did I turn off the room heater?”<br /> <br />…No wait, would there even be a heater in April? I stopped and fell deep in thought.<br /> <br />Right after, something grazed the tip of my nose with a ‘shoom!’ sound.<br /> <br />“Wha—?! He dodged aga—”<br /> <br />“Hm? Did something happen just now?”<br /> <br />I didn’t notice at all!<br /> <br />Nothing about a Black Ball grazing the tip of my nose!<br /> <br />No, I didn’t notice at all, everything was coincidence too.<br /> <br />How I stopped right at the spot barely missed by the Black Ball.<br /> <br />How I happened to notice my shoelace was untied earlier.<br /> <br />How I suddenly got concerned about the room heater I’d never touched before.<br /> <br />Everything was ‘chance’. Commonly called miracles and coincidences.<br /> <br />My classmates who’d watched me were standing utterly stunned with eyes wide.<br /> <br />Among them, Kurashiki made a serious expression and suddenly started saying weird stuff while riding high.<br /> <br />“I see… I had a feeling for a while now that Amamori-kun is no ordinary guy.”<br /> <br />“W-What are you saying, Hotaru…san?”<br /> <br />Asahina san’s bewildered voice.<br /> <br />With the class’s attention gathered on her, Kurashiki began saying:<br /> <br />“Getting continuously violent treatment from someone as strong as Kirido-kun… Yet he didn’t have a single fracture. I thought there must be a reason, but… Right! Amamori-kun has extremely good luck!”<br /> <br />What’s she saying? I and over half the class thought that.<br /> <br />However, Asahina showed a completely different reaction.<br /> <br />“I-If everything until now was him miraculously avoiding vital spots…!”<br /> <br />“[Whims of Fate], let’s call it that, shall we?”<br /> <br />Hearing someone’s words, Asahina turned to look.<br /> <br />Following her gaze, there was our bandanna-wearing classmate Tendou Yuji.<br /> <br />Letting out a “Fufufu!” laugh, he shouted chuuni-ly at full power.<br /> <br />“That’s right! That itself is the innate gift bestowed upon Amamori! Even manifesting the low-ranking Ability [Eyesight Ruiner] was fate! Due to his ‘strong luck,’ it’s a god-forged chain of destiny!”<br /> <br />“In other words…!”<br /> <br />“‘Unexpectedly, Mr. Amamori might be strong!'”<br /> <br />“‘Black Ball.'”<br /> <br />“Huh!?”<br /> <br />A merciless blow struck directly at my abdomen.<br /> <br />…Sorry for interrupting the excitement.<br /> <br />I couldn’t avoid it three times in a row, especially while things were heating up.<br /> <br />I let out a frog-like sound as I was blown away and crouched, clutching my stomach.<br /> <br />In response to this scene, Ms. Tendo chuckled while holding her eyepatch.<br /> <br />“His luck be strong, but remember, it’s only within the scope of ‘unexpected.’ That’s the fate you’re under!”<br /> <br />“…So?”<br /> <br />“Well, in the end, Amamori probably can’t beat Kurotsuki-san, right?”<br /> <br />In the end, it seemed they reached that conclusion.<br /> <br />Asahina-san rushed over at an incredible speed, and there was an atmosphere among everyone like, “Well, it’s Amamori after all…”<br /> <br />Of course, that was to be expected. If I couldn’t even defeat Kirido, there was no way I could beat Kurotsuki. If I had that kind of power, I would have used it in the battle against Kirido.<br /> <br />“Are you okay, Amamori-kun? Let’s… uh, go to the infirmary.”<br /> <br />“I’m fine… Asana…ma. It seems it didn’t have as much power as it looked.”<br /> <br />“Uhm, that’s good, but my name is Asahina, not Asana, Amamori-kun.”<br /> <br />She said that with a lonely expression, but I didn’t take her hand and got up on my own.<br /> <br />When I looked ahead, Kurotsuki kanade was staring at me.<br /> <br />Unbelievable. He seemed to be saying that with his eyes wide open as he looked at me.<br /> <br />“You finally looked at me.”<br /> <br />“…?”<br /> <br />Asahina couldn’t seem to understand my words, so she tilted her head.<br /> <br />But on the other hand, it had a tremendous effect on Kurotsuki.<br /> <br />“You… You…”<br /> <br />“Thank you, Kurotsuki-kun, for going out of your way to ‘go easy’ on me.”<br /> <br />“You…”<br /> <br />Only now, upon arriving here, did Kurotsuki’s expression distort.<br /> <br />After glancing at his expression, I raised both hands toward Teacher Sakaki.<br /> <br />Seeing this, she smiled and announced the end of the training.<br /> </p>

<p> <br />“Unbelievable.”<br /> <br />Kurotsuki kanade muttered as he watched Amamori Yuuto walk away without anyone’s assistance.<br /> <br />Classes were already over, and his classmates were returning to the school building.<br /> <br />Among them, he stopped in his tracks and recalled the ‘simulated battle’ from earlier.<br /> <br />For the training partner, Teacher Sakaki had chosen a classmate named Amamori.<br /> <br />To everyone’s eyes, he appeared ordinary, mediocre, and completely unremarkable. There was no hint of talent.<br /> <br />He had been targeted by Kirido, a pitiable male student.<br /> <br />That’s how he had been seen… until just a moment ago.<br /> <br />“He dodged my attacks.”<br /> <br />The first time, he thought it might have been a fluke, but the second time, he deliberately released his magic to test Amamori’s reactions. He observed his movements closely. He clearly saw that Amamori was tracking the path of his magic.<br /> <br />Amamori Yuuto had seen his attacks.<br /> <br />And even then, he had the composure to put on such a performance.<br /> <br />In other words, he had seen through Kurotsuki completely and was playing around.<br /> <br />The moment he realized that, a chill ran down his spine.<br /> <br />He wasn’t oblivious to his own power.<br /> <br />He knew he was strong. He was confident that depending on circumstances, he could even beat Asahina Kasumi.<br /> <br />In the worst case, it might be the strongest Ability in their grade.<br /> <br />That was his [Divine Protection of the Devil King]. The new talent granted to him.<br /> <br />An annoying, detestable power that should have been—or so it was supposed to be…<br /> <br />“Why?”<br /> <br />He remembered that guy- Amwmori’s power as weak.<br /> <br />Since he had no interest, he didn’t remember the details of the Ability.<br /> <br />He just remembered it was an Ability surprisingly weak. That was all.<br /> <br />Yet despite that, he had dodged two of his attacks.<br /> <br />And after being dodged twice, shocked and losing composure on that third ‘held back’ shot—<br /> <br />—the final blow fired with his full ‘seriousness’ in terms of power and speed.<br /> <br />A normal person would have died, and it wouldn’t be strange.<br /> <br />That was how much power it had, as the one who fired it understood best of all.<br /> <br />So why, how, how?<br /> <br />—…Why was that guy able to casually stand back up?<br /> <br />Feeling an indescribable ‘creepiness,’ he grabbed one arm.<br /> <br />It was the right arm he had fired the Black Ball at Amamori with.<br /> <br />In the worst case, he might have become a murderer.<br /> <br />The moment he fired it, he thought ‘This is bad.’<br /> <br />…But now, he felt an emotion greater than that.<br /> <br />Kurotsuki was a genius. A monster acknowledged by himself and others as well.<br /> <br />Yet that monster—was frightened.<br /> <br />The chills wouldn’t stop, the goosebumps wouldn’t fade.<br /> <br />A bottomless dread that even made him feel fear.<br /> <br />“Amamori Yuuto… Just what is he…?”<br /> <br />Today, for the first time, Kurotsuki kanade recognized him.<br /> <br />Recognized the human known as Amamori Yuuto as an individual ‘self’.<br /> <br />—Properly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The day after P.E. class.<br /> <br />“Good morning, Amamori-kun! I’m your classmate, Asahina!”<br /> <br />“Morning, Asakawa-san.”<br /> <br />As usual I greeted Asahina, passed by her, and sat at my seat.<br /> <br />Shocked Asahina-san and Kurashiki, who naturally ran to her.<br /> <br />The two seemed to be chatting, saying things like “Well, yet another wrong name… Does Amamori-kun’s vocabulary really have no bottom?” and “No, but just having him return my greeting is enough for now, Hotaru-san.”<br /> <br />Hmm. Though each time I just randomly come up with names on the spot… If this keeps up, I’m afraid my own vocabulary might run out someday. I should look up some more common surnames starting with ‘A.’<br /> <br />“Yo, ohayou Amamori!”<br /> <br />“Ah, ohayou Karasuma. As handsome as ever today.”<br /> <br />“And you as always have a straight face, huh? And as usual, you’ve gotten Asahina-san’s name wrong! What’s up with your ears?”<br /> <br />“Asa? Who’s that?”<br /> <br />I have these kinds of ears.<br /> <br />As if to say that, I return the question, and Karasuma laughs happily.<br /> <br />Well, he’s probably realized by now that I get the name wrong on purpose. And yet, he incorporates that into the conversation, trying to get a small laugh out of it. Extroverts sure are scary.<br /> <br />“Come on, don’t overdo it. Asahina-san is a girl after all.”<br /> <br />“What, I’m just an egalitarian.”<br /> <br />After all, just to paint Kirido as a complete villain, I had Kurashiki ‘punch herself.’ Male or female, I treat them equally when facing them.<br /> <br />As I turn my gaze out the window, Karasuma grimaces and returns his gaze to the front of the room.<br /> <br />Glancing at the clock, there’s still plenty of time before homeroom starts.<br /> <br />Now then, I’d rather not get caught up with Asahina-san… Maybe I’ll pretend to be asleep.<br /> <br />With that thought, I rest my cheek on my hand as if sleeping on my desk.<br /> <br />–The next instant.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“Yaa yaa! Lively as always, right, you scumbags of Class C?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Along with the unfamiliar voice, footsteps echo.<br /> <br />I’m surprised but don’t even lift my face, having no real interest, and continue my nap as the classroom starts buzzing with a different nuance than before.<br /> <br />“Ugh…that guy.”<br /> <br />“W-What’s with him? A f-first year, right?”<br /> <br />As my classmates begin to feel uneasy, the footsteps proceed to the front of the classroom.<br /> <br />The owner of the footsteps stands at the podium and raises his voice with a mocking tone.<br /> <br />“Nice to meet you…though I’m not interested in more than half of you so don’t bother remembering me. The name’s Netsuhara. I’m the president of Class 1-A, or something like that.”<br /> <br />A president with such a foul mouth, is that okay?<br /> <br />While lying there thinking that, I realize our president had a foul mouth too.<br /> <br />I see, so people with foul mouths become presidents huh.<br /> <br />Thinking about such things, I’m tapped on the head and reluctantly sit up.<br /> <br />Looking over, it’s Kurashiki as expected. She briefly glances at me as I get up, then walks straight toward this Netsuhara person.<br /> <br />“Um…Netsuhara-kun was it? Why the sudden visit…?”<br /> <br />“Hah? Shut it, small fry.”<br /> <br />I felt Kurashiki’s face tighten for an instant.<br /> <br />Ah…she must be extremely angry inside. Please stop, I’ll be the one getting whacked later. While thinking that, Netsuhara rests his hands on the podium.<br /> <br />An insolent smile floats on his face.<br /> <br />And in his eyes is something close to certainty.<br /> <br />“I’ll get straight to the point. Which one of you bastards got Kirido expelled?”<br /> <br />His words make the classroom fall silent.<br /> <br />Rather than silence…it was more like dumbfounded stillness from not comprehending.<br /> <br />Amidst the bewildered majority of the class, Netsuhara raises his voice again.<br /> <br />“A class that gets its first expulsion on the first week of enrollment…I hear it grabs the attention of the current second and third years too. And they say, in a class like that, there’s always one or two…or even more ‘interesting guys.'”<br /> <br />I knew about this too. Or rather, my accomplice had just told me recently.<br /> <br />Among the first years, especially a class that gets an expulsion early on, there is bound to be an outstanding character.<br /> <br />Though that character isn’t necessarily a good person.<br /> <br />For third year, it’s the current student council president.<br /> <br />For second year, it’s the current disciplinary committee chairman and student council vice president.<br /> <br />On the first day of enrollment, they weren’t tripped up by the ‘lights out at 8PM’ school rule. Rather, they used that rule to test their classmates. And how things flowed after that was, they responded in some way to the troublemakers… Well, the result was expulsion so the process doesn’t matter much.<br /> <br />Netsuhara probably looked into this somewhere.<br /> <br />I rest my cheek on my hand, disinterested, as I watch Kurashiki.<br /> <br />Asahina-san still isn’t moving huh. Then as class rep, this should be Kurashiki’s role.<br /> <br />“Kirido…kun? There’s no one like that.”<br /> <br />“Oi small fry, didn’t I tell you to shut it? Is your ears full of earwax or something? Or could it be…you’re the one who crushed Kirido from the shadows!”<br /> <br />His last suspicion is spot on, though of course I feign ignorance.<br /> <br />Kurashiki is… Looking over, she’s covering her mouth in shock and slumps over. Seeing that, classmates who are fans of Kurashiki stand up.<br /> <br />“You bastard! What are you doing to Kurashiki-chan!”<br /> <br />“Who are you? Why are you suddenly saying such things!”<br /> <br />“Ooo, quite the bark. As expected of losers.”<br /> <br />Netsuhara provokes them as they angrily roar. Loser huh…<br /> <br />Reminds me of that rumor about competent guys in Class A and underachievers in Class C.<br /> <br />In this case though, with Asahina-san, Kurashiki Hotaru, and Kurotsuki kanade enrolled, I don’t think that categorization applies.<br /> <br />“So? Who is it? I’m looking forward to it! The one who stood out from the start, who knew that, yet still mercilessly pushed a classmate to expulsion! I can smell the same stench from that guy! It makes me excited!”<br /> <br />Please stop. Being told I have the same stench as you is disgusting.<br /> <br />While indicating my repulsion, I narrow my eyes at his words.<br /> <br />His actions and atmosphere certainly resemble the expelled Kirido but…he seems much more cunning than that fool.<br /> <br />Seeing Netsuhara’s certainty, a few classmates show uneasy expressions. Reflected in their faces are doubts. And the first one they would suspect is the boy who was bullied by Kirido.<br /> <br />Moreover, that guy doesn’t interact with classmates.<br /> <br />Even if suspected, there would be little guilt.<br /> <br />Several gazes naturally gather toward me, and Netsuhara’s gaze catches me.<br /> <br />“Oh…don’t tell me it’s that small fry.”<br /> <br />As Netsuhara takes a step toward me, I don’t even twitch and continue resting my cheek on my hand.<br /> <br />Because there was no need to react or refute.<br /> <br />Even if I don’t, a hero of justice won’t allow such groundless suspicions.<br /> <br />In my vision, she stands up in that spot.<br /> <br />Her straight, supple back and glossy black hair.<br /> <br />The undisputed strongest character in this class.<br /> <br />She steps in front of Netsuhara and resonates her dignified voice.<br /> <br />“I’m sorry but… I cannot allow any more of this, Netsuhara-kun.”<br /> <br />“Hoh… Quite something… But doesn’t seem like it’s you.”<br /> <br />Even Netsuhara, for all his bluster, stops in front of Asahina.<br /> <br />But he must have immediately sensed ‘Asahina won’t be heartless.’ He starts walking again as if losing interest. Asahina-san steps into his path.<br /> <br />“…What is it? Gonna get in my way?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will get in your way. I was listening to what you wanted to say but… It seems you are mainly trying to destroy the unity of this class, using the fact that we had an expulsion as a trigger.”<br /> <br />She’s probably off base.<br /> <br />But even if she’s wrong, if Asahina-san herself shows any doubt in this classroom full of suspicion, the doubts of the whole class will turn to me simultaneously.<br /> <br />And what awaits is a world without weakness.<br /> <br />In other words, my expulsion.<br /> <br />“…Amamori-kun. Though I haven’t been able to provide reassurance so far… Let me say this clearly. Please rest assured. You are merely a victim… I absolutely will not allow such groundless accusations, no matter what.”<br /> <br />Asahina-san pierces me with a sharp gaze.<br /> <br />I could just say my usual “Who are you?” but… I’ll give her a little push on the back here.<br /> <br />“I see… At first… I was confused about why I was being suspected, and… froze up. Do I… look like the sort of person who could do something like that to everyone?”<br /> <br />“You don’t look it. Oi, don’t you think suspecting Amamori is going too far? Don’t just get swept along.”<br /> <br />Following my voice, the male student reigning at the pinnacle of the class hierarchy continued.<br /> <br />The boy with the short hair and sharp eyes. His name–Sakuma Jyunya.<br /> <br />That playboy…the man who completely snatched the position Kirido held, even pushing aside Karasuma. The lump of manliness with an air as if to say ‘Shut up and follow me.’ Member of the baseball club.<br /> <br />That was my classmate, Sakuma.<br /> <br />Since enrolling, he had been absent from school for just over a week with a high fever. But probably, if Sakuma had been there on the first day of school, Kirido wouldn’t have been able to run so rampant.<br /> <br />With his single remark, the suspicions toward me faded from the class. Unable to hide his irritation at that, Netsuhara clicks his tongue, but still walks this way… Or so I thought, but<br /> <br />“Tch…lost my drive. I’m not used to this whole criminal search thing.”<br /> <br />Saying that, he scratches his head and obediently starts walking toward the entrance.<br /> <br />…At that time, our eyes met for an instant.<br /> <br />What was reflected in his eyes was probably disappointment… The groundless assumption of ‘As expected, it’s not you huh.’ I avert my gaze from him.<br /> <br />Then completely losing interest in me, the guy deeply inhales before saying loudly enough for the whole class to hear.<br /> <br />“Welp, rather than searching for criminals, crushing the whole damn class suits me better! Hahahahahaha!”<br /> <br />Several people glanced at him, their shoulders tensing.<br /> <br />After all, what resided in those eyes was a profound madness.<br /> <br />Without reason, without evidence, yet with unwavering confidence.<br /> <br />There was no way he could fail, no way he could lose.<br /> <br />Such baseless, unfounded, and blind self-assuredness. In other words, madness.<br /> <br />It was eerie.<br /> <br />The classmates felt a sense of dread.<br /> <br />“So, yeah. If any of you happen to figure out who the culprit is, come let me know, okay? Then, the class… At the very least, I’ll make sure to help that person! Hahahaha!”<br /> <br />And with that, the man walked away.<br /> <br />I just silently watched his retreating back… However.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“That shithead bastarrrrrd!”<br /> <br />As expected, Kurashiki Hotaru was raging.<br /> <br />No curses on those who don’t touch gods. I’m engrossed in reading, and what do you know. Even though I haven’t touched her, for some reason the god came to me.<br /> <br />“Oi! Aren’t you pissed after the stuff that guy said!?”<br /> <br />“Calm down a bit… If you’re dissatisfied, I’ll be sure to make an [opportunity].”<br /> <br />We’re in the classroom I borrowed. Thanks to my accomplice’s abilities, this room is perfectly protected from eavesdropping and such. That’s why we can speak freely like this.<br /> <br />“But those who immediately resort to violence are generally troublesome. Thorough violence can only be stopped with more violence after all.”<br /> <br />Take Kirido for example. Well, since his violence wasn’t thorough, there are countless ways to deal with him. But Netsuhara is probably different. For some reason I’m convinced of that.<br /> <br />Just observing from the classroom for a short time, he’s strong.<br /> <br />In pure combat ability, comparable to Asahina-san… Might be overstating it, but at least his eyes are those of someone convinced they can defeat us.<br /> <br />Now then, how much should I intervene against Netsuhara who has started moving…<br /> <br />While thinking about that, Kurashiki looks at me with an indescribable expression.<br /> <br />“…You won’t say you can’t do it, right?”<br /> <br />“??”<br /> </p>







<p><br />I tilt my head, not understanding Kurashiki’s words.<br /> <br />Washing dishes. That act is troublesome yet simple.<br /> <br />In terms of feeling, dealing with Netsuhara now is similar to crushing Kirido before.<br /> <br />Troublesome but not to the point of being unable to handle.<br /> <br />“Of course, I haven’t considered whether I can defeat him or not.”<br /> <br />No matter what moves he makes, I can respond and would normally win.<br /> <br />If I as Amamori Yuuto think I could absolutely defeat Netsuhara, then Netsuhara cannot defeat me. Since I think that way, Netsuhara cannot win against me. So I’m considering what comes after that.<br /> <br />“The issue is how to connect things going forward. I do think I should encourage Class C’s growth but…”<br /> <br />“Eww, disgustingly condescending.”<br /> <br />Contrary to her words, she was smiling very happily.<br /> <br />“…By the way, what’s the easiest way to crush Netsuhara?”<br /> <br />“Unfortunately, I won’t take that method. I want to move as little as possible.”<br /> <br />“So in other words, it’d be instant kill if you made a move huh…”<br /> <br />Kurashiki looks fed up, as if to say ‘Obviously.’<br /> <br />She deeply exhales and sits back in the chair, then crosses her arms and looks up at me.<br /> <br />“So, whatcha gonna do? Should just crush guys like him quickly right? That’s the limit.”<br /> <br />“Well… you have a point. Depending on his actions, Class C could suffer devastating harm too. But…”<br /> <br />I return my gaze to Kurashiki.<br /> <br />As she tilts her head curiously, I speak.<br /> <br />“Still, I’ll leave this matter to Asahina. Kirido went too far so I crushed him, but if we make every move, Asahina’s accumulated achievements from now on will be diminished.”<br /> <br />“Oh… I see that line of thinking.”<br /> <br />In other words, proactive versus dependent on others.<br /> <br />Kurashiki is the ‘Just [do it yourself] and quickly crush any troublesome guys’ type.<br /> <br />On the other hand, I’m the ‘Have them [take care of] troublesome issues, and make use of their growth’ type.<br /> <br />The end result of crushing them is the same.<br /> <br />I’m just considering how to connect the events after that.<br /> <br />“Certainly… When you put it that way, they’re gonna be crushed anyway so it’d be a waste if they didn’t amount to something. Retiring undefeated is kinda sad huh.”<br /> <br />That’s right. Now that I think about it, I really did Kirido wrong.<br /> <br />He probably had a better way to go out too.<br /> <br />I should have wrung him completely dry, sucked him down to a dry husk, then thrown him away.<br /> <br />I’ll learn from that mistake this time, and completely utilize Netsuhara’s malice.<br /> <br />If he’s going to be crushed anyway, let him be crushed by Asahina Kasumi. And use that as her track record to raise Asahina’s fame—that’s the first choice. However, that Asahina-san has issues too.<br /> <br />Frankly, right now she is too weak. Lacking any threat despite her speed.<br /> <br />In combat strength…and other aspects like intellect too.<br /> <br />Above all, Asahina Kasumi appears mentally fragile.<br /> <br />She won’t be able to endure the ‘battles’ to come unless she grows more.<br /> <br />Well, that’s not just limited to Asahina alone.<br /> <br />“Well, that’s how it is. Once you understand, think up a plan to sic Asahina-san on him. You’re in charge of the surface-level progression.”<br /> <br />“Man, you gave me a pain-in-the-ass role.”<br /> <br />Even as she complains, her eyes are blazing.<br /> <br />She’s probably thinking up ways to mess with Netsuhara.<br /> <br />Glancing at her figure, I return my gaze to the light novel I had been reading.<br /> <br />Now then, leaving Netsuhara to Asahina-san and Kurashiki.<br /> <br />If everything goes well, I can get started on another issue without worries.<br /> <br />But what if Netsuhara turns out to be the type of guy who exceeds Asahina and Kurashiki’s expectations?<br /> <br />“…Ah, what a pain.”<br /> <br />I mutter and lightly scratch my head.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The next week after the weekend, Monday.<br /> <br />That day was the lift of the ban on Duel Requests.<br /> <br />Most students probably won’t have many chances to use Duel Requests much.<br /> <br />I also don’t foresee having almost any chances to use it.<br /> <br />That’s why I didn’t consider it very important.<br /> <br />At least, not until this moment.<br /> <br />“A ‘Duel Request.'”<br /> <br />Before homeroom started.<br /> <br />When everyone had gathered in class, 15 minutes before the bell.<br /> <br />Netsuhara, appearing no different than last week, stated that as if it were natural.<br /> <br />“…Um.”<br /> <br />“Didn’t hear me, you earwax-clogged morons? I’m pickin’ a fight.”<br /> <br />Ooh boy, this guy’s still talking to Kurashiki-san so rudely.<br /> <br />Kurashiki, who just went “…Um” in response, has tightened up.<br /> <br />I can’t even imagine how much rage is burning inside her without my head starting to hurt.<br /> <br />“First year, Class A, Netsuhara Nagashi. …You’ve come again huh. What a guy with nothing better to do.”<br /> <br />“Hah? Oh…yeah, there was a mountain boss wannabe mob character from Class C huh. At the point you’ve become the successor to some instant kill small fry named Kirido, I know your level. Shut it.”<br /> <br />“…………Hah?”<br /> <br />Our boss, Sakuma, said that sarcastically.<br /> <br />Even though Netsuhara responded with 100% malice, I feel like Sakuma is also about to snap. This must be what they call a hair trigger situation.</p>

<p> <br />“W-Whoa, Sakuma! Calm down! You’re just doing what he wants!”<br /> <br />“Karasuma…Tch, I know that!”<br /> <br />I couldn’t say that he definitely didn’t know that.<br /> <br />Thanks to Karasuma’s nice play, Mt. Sakuma’s eruption was somehow avoided.<br /> <br />While internally wiping cold sweat, I turn my gaze forward where Karasuma, similarly looking toward Netsuhara, starts to smile.<br /> <br />“So? What’re you planning? I’d be super grateful if you could come again another time. I mean, homeroom’s gonna start real soon, yeah?”<br /> <br />“Pfft, like I care ’bout that. Listen, on the first day I brought Class A to heel and took all their money. 10 or 100 thousand yen, nothing can restrain my actions.”<br /> <br />“You fiend…!”<br /> <br />Asahina-san raised her voice at Netsuhara’s words.<br /> <br />This guy…had been taking money from his classmates. Even if he took 200,000 yen from each one…that’s a staggering 5.8 million yen. Over ten times the initial allowance they’re given. And adding his own money, it could easily surpass 6 million.<br /> <br />I’m not envious…no, how evil! Unforgivable!<br /> <br />Everyone must have thought the same as me, shouting in anger.<br /> <br />“From your classmates… What are you thinking! If you do such a thing, the lives of many students will…!”<br /> <br />“Don’t care.”<br /> <br />Asahina-san’s logic doesn’t reach Netsuhara.<br /> <br />“Besides, maybe I said it wrong. But listen, I was ‘given’ this money from my classmates. C’mon, they happily handed it over when I politely asked. Though…I’ll stop there. I feel like I’ve gone off track from my original talk.”<br /> <br />Yeah, I was thinking that too.<br /> <br />No matter how much money he extorted from Class A.<br /> <br />No matter how much his classmates from that class suffered.<br /> <br />Frankly speaking…I don’t really care either. What we should focus on now are the ‘words’ Netsuhara just uttered here. That’s much more important.<br /> <br />“‘Duel Request’…right? Shithead.”<br /> <br />Sakuma, not even trying to hide his bad mood, and Netsuhara leisurely returning.<br /> <br />“Insulting me is meaningless, dumbface. …So yeah. To answer the original question, that’s right.”<br /> <br />His words send a tension through the class.<br /> <br />Duel Request. Those words hold an influence stronger than the school rules in this academy.<br /> <br />In that ‘battle,’ both sides must agree.<br /> <br />It’s not a case where he suddenly challenged us and we’re in trouble.<br /> <br />The fact that he came here means…he has ‘something’ to make us accept.<br /> <br />“…Then the talk is over. We will not accept your request. We have no courtesy to return to someone like you without manners.”<br /> <br />“Don’t gimme that self-righteous crap. I think you were called Asahina Kasumi? Aside from the guy who got Kirido expelled, I’m thinking of buying you the most in this class. Be my wife, ‘kay?”<br /> <br />He’s speaking like Kirido.<br /> <br />Everyone must have thought it.<br /> <br />Asahina rests her hand on her forehead and sighs.<br /> <br />“Honestly, saying such jokes again… Oh well. Please go home. It doesn’t seem like there’s anything left to discuss with you.”<br /> <br />Asahina declares. However, Netsuhara, who should have been lightly rejected, is still smiling.<br /> <br />As if he had wanted to be rejected, he continues speaking with a carefree smile.<br /> <br />“I’ll give you some kind advice–you’re gonna regret it.”<br /> <br />“Thank you very much. I’ll be sure not to regret it.”<br /> <br />As soon as Asahina-san says that, she closes her eyes and shuts him out completely.<br /> <br />Seeing her attitude, Netsuhara scratches his head in frustration, and his actions make some classmates chuckle… However, I was ruminating on the words he had said.<br /> <br />Certainly, if it had ended with that, it would be laughable.<br /> <br />Despite coming in so confidently, he retreats after being rejected. It would surely lower our assessment of Netsuhara. But…he didn’t seem to be lying.<br /> <br />He had seriously said we would regret it.<br /> <br />And there was a light in his eyes like madness.<br /> <br />“Welp, can’t be helped. Get your necks washed and wait, ‘kay?”<br /> <br />And so Netsuhara left Class 1-C.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–The incident happened the next day.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />☆☆☆<br /> </p>







<p> <br />The next day’s homeroom.<br /> <br />One seat in the class was empty.<br /> <br />“That Manabe guy was attacked by someone yesterday.”<br /> <br />Understanding the ‘meaning’ of Sakaki-sensei’s words, I internally sigh.<br /> <br />The other students made shocked or confused expressions, but come on, even an idiot can understand. –It’s Netsuhara’s doing.<br /> <br />“W-What!? Sakaki-sensei! In other words, um, is Manabe okay!?”<br /> <br />“Calm down, Karasuma. Looks like he was ambushed when he went out to the convenience store last night. Thankfully his injuries aren’t too serious but…they’re not light either. Consider it enough that we teachers have decided he should take off school to recover.”<br /> <br />In other words, it’s worse than when I was punched by Kirido.<br /> <br />Speaking of Manabe-kun, he’s the guy who during self-introductions said ‘I’m married. Ah, let me say upfront I’m not interested in the 3D world. My wife is in the 2D world’ and made that crazy explosive remark, earning him fame as a guy recognized as an otaku by himself and others.<br /> <br />“Manabe-kun…”<br /> <br />He was highly ranked in my ‘Normal Friends I’d Like to Make’ list. If not for the Kurotsuki incident, I really wanted to become friends with him right away… Dammit! I won’t forgive you Netsuhara! Asahina-san, it’s on you!<br /> <br />“…So there’s no mistake the attacker was…Netsuhara-kun, right?”<br /> <br />Asahina-san’s unusually sharp voice makes Sakaki-sensei groan.<br /> <br />“Well…I do think it was probably him. However, there’s absolutely no ‘definite proof’ he attacked. The only testimony is Manabe himself saying ‘I was attacked by Netsuhara.’ But…”<br /> <br />“Tch, it was that bastard for sure. He’s probably saying stuff like ‘There’s no proof I did it. Rather, Class C is trying to frame me.'”<br /> <br />Sakaki-sensei deeply nods at Sakuma’s words.<br /> <br />“That’s right. I’m certain but…there’s far too little evidence. I have no doubt it was done after grasping the locations of security cameras.”<br /> <br />“Then that means…”<br /> <br />Kurashiki mutters uncomfortably.<br /> <br />Responding to her reaction, an unexpected voice comes from outside the classroom.<br /> <br />“There’s no proof so I can’t be punished, riiight?”<br /> <br />Our gazes simultaneously turn toward the entrance at the echoing voice.<br /> <br />Standing there is Netsuhara with a thin smile.<br /> <br />It’s homeroom time…so scolding him probably won’t work.<br /> <br />After all, he’s here precisely because he breaks school rules.<br /> <br />“Did you enjoy my gift?”<br /> <br />“You…!”<br /> <br />Sakuma flies into a rage at Netsuhara’s words.<br /> <br />However, Sakaki-sensei stops him with one hand.<br /> <br />“Now, Sakaki…sensei. But–“<br /> <br />“I know. …Netsuhara, was it? What do you mean?”<br /> <br />Sakaki-sensei’s expression is unusually angry. Even the ever-optimistic, hedonistic her finds it unacceptable for her class to be targeted.<br /> <br />“Huh? I thought I gave Sakuma-kun a present this morning… Was I mistaken?”<br /> <br />“Answer seriously. I’ll expel you.”<br /> <br />“If you do that, the Class A homeroom teacher will hold a grudge against you, you know?”<br /> <br />Netsuhara doesn’t even show signs of flinching at Sakaki-sensei’s threat.<br /> <br />Sakaki-sensei can expel Netsuhara without question.<br /> <br />However, if she does that without reason, the Class A homeroom teacher whose student was suddenly expelled will be displeased. At worst, he may expel Class C students for similar flimsy reasons. That would be a never-ending revenge battle…the worst case scenario.<br /> <br />Sakaki-sensei furrows her eyebrows while my classmates gnash their teeth in frustration.<br /> <br />Amidst that, Netsuhara doesn’t lose his nonchalant attitude.<br /> <br />“So, have you thought about what I said yesterday?”<br /> <br />“…You mean the Duel Request issue, Netsuhara-kun?”<br /> <br />There’s no mistaking the anger in Asahina-san’s voice to anyone listening.<br /> <br />Her emotions are overflowing with rage, she’s gnashing her teeth in vexation, recognizing the person before her eyes as an enemy.<br /> <br />I can easily imagine her feelings from her back. That’s how much killing intent there is.<br /> <br />“You said you wouldn’t accept, right?”<br /> <br />“Yes, I firmly decline. Let’s start over tomorrow. In the meantime, I may kill time playing some ‘games’ huh? I might~”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />He knows what ‘game’ means.<br /> <br />In short, attacking Class C students from the shadows.<br /> <br />…This guy would probably seriously do it. He already got Manabe-kun after all, and I think the violence won’t stop regardless of gender.<br /> <br />Even if we completely secure the school and prevent assaults for a day or two, we can’t keep that up for the next three years. There will definitely come a day we’re attacked by him.<br /> <br />…To prevent that, we have no choice but to accept his proposal.<br /> <br />Moreover, in just a single day, our positions had been completely reversed.<br /> <br />“But for me, I’ve been in a good mood lately whether you accept or not, y’know?”<br /> <br />His voice is tinged with provocation.<br /> <br />“I’ve really been into this game recently of sneak attacking monkeys walking around off guard from behind. It’s just so fun, so fun…I can’t stop, y’know?”<br /> <br />“…In other words, unless we apply for a Duel Request under disadvantageous conditions, the attacks will continue indefinitely…”<br /> <br />I’m impressed at Asahina-san’s words.<br /> <br />I see, that’s good thinking.<br /> <br />With no evidence we can catch, we have no choice but to request a duel from Netsuhara, with the condition of ‘Class A will not attack Class C.’<br /> <br />In other words, Class C has to be the one extending the request.<br /> <br />Then Class A can demand outrageous returns for that condition.<br /> <br />Netsuhara laughs loudly, then voices his wish.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I’ll accept, ‘kay? But if you lose, all of you get expelled.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />An outrageous return.<br /> <br />Class A’s condition for accepting the Duel Request.<br /> <br />It was the worst.<br /> </p>
