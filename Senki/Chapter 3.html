<h1>Chapter 3: My Younger Sister Is a Cosplayer, but Is It Okay to Support Her?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Yukina’s sudden declaration surprised me too…Hmm? Well, I’ve already said it many times, but the collaboration with Mariel-sama was out of nowhere for me too. We weren’t acquainted with each other before the collaboration. Oh, thank you for the first comment!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It was the night after I reunited with Serika for the first time in years.</p>



<p>After playing LoF on stream for a while, I decided to have a short chat session with my viewers.</p>



<p>No, it might be more accurate to say that I was struggling with the overflow of questions in the comment section. It used to be empty during live streams, but now it’s flooded with comments. After the incident with Yukina and Mariel-sama, the number of live viewers for my streams has reached five digits. Considering that it was in the single digits before, the inflation is tremendous.</p>



<p>However, I’m not the type to be conceited enough to think that this happened because of my talent. It’s only thanks to Yukina and Mariel-sama that I was able to achieve this… I have to make sure that I work hard to maintain this number. It’s going to be tough but I don’t want to disappoint them after they gave me this opportunity.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about such things and struggling with the overflowing comments, there was a sudden knock on the door, and it opened.</p>



<p>“Is it okay now, onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>The one who came was my little sister, Sana. It wasn’t particularly strange for Sana to visit my room, but I was currently in the middle of a livestream. Sana’s voice definitely got caught on stream, and at that moment, the comment section began to buzz.</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [Who’s voice was that just now?]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [She said ‘onii-chan’ just now, right?]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [The <em>imouto </em>is here!]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [So he has an <em>imouto</em>, huh?]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [Her voice is cute!]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [Damn, I’m so jealous!]</p>



<p><strong>Chat</strong>: [Let us talk with your <em>imouto</em>!!]</p>



<p>How much do you guys like <em>imoutos</em>?! I couldn’t help but want to retort, but honestly, I understand the sentiment. If I were on the viewer’s side, I would probably have a similar reaction, and incidents like the streamer’s family suddenly appearing are kind of fun to watch, right? You get to see a different side of them… Wait, this isn’t the time for that!</p>



<p>I turned to Sana and gestured to convey that I was currently livestreaming.</p>



<p>“…I’m in the middle of a stream right now.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Then, Sana responded to my flustered words with her usual carefree manner.  </p>



<p>“Ah, right, it’s that time of the day again.” (Sana)</p>



<p>She left as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>Until now, Sana had always been considerate in such situations, never visiting my room when I was streaming. That’s why I thought there might be something urgent in she suddenly did so, but it seems that wasn’t the case. So what was that all about…?</p>



<p>Tilting my head, I resumed my conversation with my viewers while they continue to question me about my <em>imouto</em>. Then, my smartphone’s notification rang. Upon checking, there were messages from Yukina and Serika. </p>



<p>“(Kei-kun, so you have an <em>imouto</em>. I’d like to meet her. I also want to see the onii-chan version of Kei-kun.)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>A normal(?) reaction. On the other hand, Serika’s message was filled with numerous exclamation marks.</p>



<p>“(What do you mean by <em>imouto</em>!? You didn’t have a sister, right!? What’s going on!!)” (Serika)</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I hadn’t mentioned that my dad had remarried, and I now had a step-sister. As I pondered this, my phone buzzed again with messages. </p>



<p>“(She was calling you onii-chan?! It was a loli voice, but how old is she? Wait, is she just casually entering your room!?)” (Serika)</p>



<p>A rapid-fire number of questions from Serika.</p>



<p>…Well, it might have been surprising, but why are you so desperate about it?</p>



<p>While still being chased by the usual flood of comments and the continuous messages from Serika, I couldn’t help but think about Sana’s unusual behavior, and I couldn’t shake off the feeling of unease.</p>



<p>▽</p>



<p>[The next morning…]</p>



<p>Today was supposed to be a day off, but I woke up at the usual time and got out of bed.</p>



<p>Even on my days off, I stick to the same sleeping schedule. If I somehow confuse my daily routine, I might accidentally end up skipping school on Yukina’s attendance day. That would be the worst outcome. Yep, she influenced my life down to this level. I’m such a devoted fan, aren’t I?</p>



<p>With such self-praise, I changed my clothes, washed my face, and headed to my sister’s room.</p>



<p>At the request of Kasumi-san (my dad’s remarriage partner, in other words, Sana’s mother), it had become my daily routine to wake up Sana every morning. At first, I was nervous about entering the room of a sleeping girl, even if she was my step-sister, but now I’m used to it.</p>



<p>“Hey, Sana, I’m coming in. Come on, it’s already morning, wake up.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I entered the room and approached the bed. Sana, as usual, was wrapped up in the futon, making gentle snoring sounds. Opening the nearby curtain and pulling off the blanket had become the “most efficient way to wake up Sana”. This is something I learnt over half a year of doing this.</p>



<p>“…Mmm.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Having the blanket peeled off, Sana emitted a soft voice as she curled up her body. Her posture and her pink pajamas made her look incredibly cute, but giving in to thoughts like, “Let’s let her sleep for another five minutes” would lead to trouble later, so I had to wake her up regardless of how I felt.</p>



<p>Sana, with her eyes still closed, showed no signs of escaping from the dream world.</p>



<p>As usual, I contemplated calling out to her, shaking her gently, and ultimately carrying her to the bathroom even if needed. But then…</p>



<p>“…<em>Fua</em>? Morning…? Oh, it’s morning!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Surprisingly, in the next moment, Sana voluntarily opened her eyes with a snap and sat up. I was honestly quite shocked—so much so that I jumped a bit.</p>



<p>“W-What’s wrong? You woke up quite quickly today, is there something wrong with your body or something?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…You’re saying something really rude.” (Sana)</p>



<p>In response to my reaction, Sana puffed up her cheeks, looking displeased. Well, can you blame me? Does she know how much I struggle with waking her up every morning?</p>



<p>“You would usually cling to the bed for more than five minutes. Sometimes even longer. How many times were we almost late to school because of it…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Heh, Sana managed to wake up by herself today. It’s a very good morning.” (Sana)</p>



<p>T-This girl, saying such deliberately dramatic lines while avoiding eye contact…!</p>



<p>“Oh, more importantly, Onii-chan, what about breakfast?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…Well, I’m going to prepare it now. You should go wash your face fir──” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I was about to say that, Sana suddenly stood up from the bed.</p>



<p>“So it’s not done yet? Great. Sana will prepare breakfast.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>She said that out of the blue, leaving me bewildered.</p>



<p>…Sana preparing breakfast? That has never happened before, right?</p>



<p>“W-What the heck are you doing!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>And for some reason, Sana, while being slightly flustered, started changing right there. I hurriedly tried to shield my eyes with my hands, but for some reason, it didn’t work, and I ended up seeing the whole thing perfectly.</p>



<p>I would say that I’ve become more accustomed to life living with her ever since she moved in. I’ve grown used to her casual outfits after taking a bath and even the occasional glimpse of her panties. However, if she’s straight-up changing right in front of me, that’s a different story.</p>



<p>“…Ah! G-Get out!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Realizing what she was doing, Sana kicked me out of the room, and I finally let out a sigh. Well, I should have left on my own, but I didn’t expect it.</p>



<p>“…Seriously, what’s up with her?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Feeling dissatisfied, I made my way to the kitchen. Also, what does she mean by she’ll prepare breakfast? Until now, the usual routine was for me to cook every morning and somehow get Sana, who still wasn’t fully awake, to eat. What’s going on?</p>



<p>I don’t understand, but since she said that, I couldn’t just go ahead and prepare breakfast on my own. All I can do is wait around and see what she does.</p>



<p>“…Sorry for the wait. Sana will get it ready soon.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Shortly after, Sana arrived and opened the fridge to search for ingredients.</p>



<p>Aside from the sense of unease seeing her like this, I was amazed by Sana’s appearance. That’s because she was wearing an apron. It was the first time I had seen Sana in an apron, so it was refreshing, or rather… she’s really cute, isn’t she?</p>



<p>“Did you always have an apron?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh? …Ah, this is the one Sana used for cosplay before.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Is that okay?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“?? What do you mean? Aprons are meant for times like this, right?” (Sana)</p>



<p>…Well, if you put it that way, it’s true, but when it’s said to be for cosplay, I can’t help but think of it as a ‘costume’.</p>



<p>“…Alright, so fried eggs and toast… Maybe a salad too. Onii-chan, just wait there.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Soon, Sana took out the ingredients and quickly started getting to work.</p>



<p>As instructed, I sat on the kitchen chair and waited for the finished meal.</p>



<p>The sight of my little sister wearing an apron and cooking… It’s nice. Yeah. I can’t quite put it into words, but it’s nice. Really nice.</p>



<p>“…<em>Fuu</em>, sorry for the wait. It’s ready.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Lost in my own thoughts, breakfast seems to be ready. In front of me were two sets of dishes on the table. Just as she said, they were fried eggs and toast, along with a tomato and lettuce salad.</p>



<p>“Then, <em>itadakimasu</em>…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…How is it? Sana’s breakfast…” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I started eating the food, Sana leaned forward with anticipation.</p>



<p>I think it’s natural to be curious about the first impressions of a breakfast one made, but isn’t she a bit too serious about this, or is it just my imagination?</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s delicious.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I answered while nodding.</p>



<p>Honestly, the toast had a slightly burnt part, the fried eggs had a bit of shell left, and the salad had unevenly cut tomatoes — but those were trivial details. There’s no way it could be bad when my sister prepared breakfast for me. I was surprised by the sudden change, but the fact that she took the initiative to prepare breakfast was undoubtedly a significant plus. Yes, maybe I’m giving this dish too high of a score, but so what?</p>



<p>“…Thank god.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Upon hearing my response, Sana smiled with a relieved expression. However, as if she had remembered something, she suddenly showed a surprised look and, for some reason, turned her back to me and began fumbling with something. …What’s she doing?</p>



<p>“H-Here, Onii-chan. Dessert.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Soon, Sana turned around and reached out her arm towards me. In her hand was a fork, and on the tip of it was a slice of apple.</p>



<p>“Hurry up and open your mouth. Here, aah.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Nonono what’s up with this!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I told you it’s dessert. C-Come on, my hand is getting tired.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Even though I was perplexed by her sudden actions, Sana was glaring at me with a somewhat desperate look. Unable to resist, I reluctantly opened my mouth and ate the apple. It was crunchy and delicious, but… it’s incredibly embarrassing!</p>



<p>“W-Well, it’s not a big deal, right? Onii-chan sometimes feeds Sana like this too so it’s not weird.” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I remained silent, Sana said that with a blush on her face. It’s true that I occasionally feed Sana when she’s half asleep, but that’s just something I do reluctantly in that specific situation. Of course, I don’t say “ahh”, and somehow, I feel like what just happened is something completely different…</p>



<p>“By the way, what about Mom and Dad? Are they working today?” (Sana)</p>



<p>After finishing breakfast and tidying up, Sana suddenly asked as if she had just remembered, and I nodded.</p>



<p>Today is a holiday, but my dad and Kasumi-san are both workaholics to an extreme degree, so they don’t care whether it’s a day off or not. Apparently, both of them left early in the morning today as usual.</p>



<p>“…So, Onii-chan, what are you going to do now?” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana was referring to household chores.</p>



<p>With our parents often absent from home, household chores naturally became our own responsibility. It had been like that even before my father remarried, so by now, I’m completely used to it.</p>



<p>“Since the laundry I did yesterday should be dry by now, I guess I’ll start by folding the laundry.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I mentioned various tasks that needed to be done, Sana, once again, leaned forward eagerly.</p>



<p>“Sana will do that. Not only that, Sana will handle everything in the house. Onii-chan doesn’t have to do anything.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh? You mean you want to handle the laundry and all the other household chores?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Faced with such an unexpected declaration, I was left speechless.</p>



<p>“…Nonono, what are you talking about? This morning’s breakfast and now this, what’s gotten into you all of a sudden? Do you have a fever or something?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I told you it’s not like that! Besides, this is nothing special.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“I don’t believe that. You usually act like even your assigned tasks are a hassle, but today, something’s definitely off. Give me a reason, tell me why.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well… It’s just… I thought I’d try to be a more domestic imouto!” (Sana)</p>



<p>…A domestic sister. That’s not something you’d hear every day.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s… um, a good thing… but why all of a sudden?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“S-Sana already told you, it’s nothing special. She just felt like doing it. Come on, since Sana said she’ll do it, Onii-chan can just play games in his room while his imouto takes care of everything.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Why do you make me sound like some awful big brother?!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Despite my protests, Sana swiftly kicked me out of the living room, saying I was getting in the way of her work. … <em>Haa</em>, what’s gotten into her all of a sudden?</p>



<p>Well, I’m genuinely happy that Sana has developed an interest in housework, but even if she insists, there’s no way I can just let my sister do all the work while I play.</p>



<p>“Should I clean some areas that don’t usually get attention?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Since Sana said she would take care of the laundry, I decided to do something else. I headed towards the storage room to grab the mop and cloth for cleaning the hallway.</p>



<p>“Yeah, something’s definitely off.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I silently cleaned with the mop, my thoughts were occupied by Sana. No matter how you think about it, this sudden change in behaviour was strange.</p>



<p>Something must have happened, but I don’t know what. </p>



<p>Come to think of it, yesterday, I told Sana about meeting my childhood friend Serika and even encountering Yuki on the spot. There was something a bit off about her reaction then.</p>



<p>At that time, she seemed like she was lost in thought about something. Still, I can’t see how that would be related to the situation at hand. Whether I meet someone or not, it shouldn’t matter to Sana.</p>



<p>“Hmm, I can’t think of anything. The cause is unknown. Maybe I’m overthinking it like she said.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>After pondering for a while without reaching any conclusion, I decided to stop thinking about it. I couldn’t even figure out what Sana was thinking even on normal days, so I gave up. As long as it’s not a bad change, it’s fine. Yup.</p>



<p>By the time I came to this conclusion, I had finished mopping the hallway, and now I was contemplating what to do next. I settled on wiping and cleaning the shelves in the living room.</p>



<p>High places are usually not cleaned often, so there’s bound to be dust buildup. It’s better to tackle the bothersome tasks while you’re motivated — with that in mind, I put away the mop and headed to the living room with a bucket filled with water and a rag in hand.</p>



<p>As I opened the door, I saw Sana sitting facing a mountain of laundry. It seemed like she was folding clothes, but there was still a considerable amount left, and she didn’t seem to have made much progress. Is she struggling? Well, I’ll just leave her be.</p>



<p>I moved a chair closer to the shelves and climbed up on it. As I was about to place the bucket on the shelf and start cleaning, I glanced back at Sana, who seemed completely unaware of my presence.</p>



<p>“……Nfu.” (Sana)</p>



<p>…Huh? What was that sound just now?</p>



<p>“…Nfufu, nfuu~” (Sana)</p>



<p>I heard a strangely deflated voice, so I turned my gaze back towards Sana, who was facing away from me again. Then, I noticed that Sana was hugging something tightly and squirming around. …What is she holding? Wait, is that my shirt?</p>



<p>“What are you doing?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Nuuh!?” (Sana)</p>



<p>When I called out to her, Sana’s body jumped as if she had been startled.</p>



<p>Sana turned around with a surprised expression, still holding onto my shirt tightly near her face. …What on earth was she doing?</p>



<p>“O-Onii-chan!? T-This is… It’s not like Sana was sniffing onii-chan’s shirt or anything like that! Um, it’s just that…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Sniffing my shirt? I’m pretty sure it’s washed properly…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“T-That’s right, exactly. Sana was just checking for that. Yeah, that’s it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana nodded vigorously. Why does she look somewhat relieved?</p>



<p>“The result of the check is that there’s no problem with Onii-chan’s shirt… it smells fine. So, you don’t have to worry about it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“You don’t need to emphasize it so seriously… But well, if it doesn’t need to be washed again, that’s a relief. I’ll go put it away then—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I tried to take the shirt back, for some reason, Sana didn’t release her tight grip on it. Instead, she looked up at me with pleading eyes.</p>



<p>“Um, well… Sana wants this. Sana really likes it… Is that okay?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh? You want my shirt? Why?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, you know… F-For cosplay.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Ah, for crossdressing, maybe? Well, it’s just casual wear, so it’s not a big deal if she wants it.</p>



<p>Even so, I can’t refuse. When I nodded, Sana whispered a quiet “Thank you” and continued to tightly hug the shirt. She must really like it.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s good that you like it, but it looks like you haven’t finished with the laundry.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“T-That’s because, um, Sana was savorin… checking Onii-chan’s shirt so it took some time. She will go and finish up now.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“I understand, it’s easy to get distracted when doing monotonous tasks. I remember once, I was watching videos on my phone while doing laundry, and before I knew it, the day had ended and the laundry was still there.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“That’s a bit too much, Sana doesn’t believe it.” (Sana)</p>



<p>…Even though Onii-chan was trying to be supportive, she just completely dismissed it. Talk about heartless.</p>



<p>As I inwardly tasted the loneliness brought by the cold glare of my heartless sister, Sana suddenly seemed to notice something and spoke up.</p>



<p>“By the way, why are you here, Onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Oh, I was planning to clean the shelves in the living room.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I pointed at the bucket as I spoke, and for some reason, Sana stood up with a displeased expression.</p>



<p>“I told you to take a break, Onii-chan. Today, Sana will handle all the housework, including cleaning.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Hey!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Ignoring my protest, Sana climbed onto the chair and reached for the bucket placed on the shelf before I could stop her. Wait, there’s water inside…!</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah!” (Sana)</p>



<p>Apparently caught off guard by the unexpected weight, Sana stumbled. The bucket she had her hand on slipped and tilted.</p>



<p>I pushed Sana away, and at the same time, a splashing sound echoed and darkness engulfed my vision.</p>



<p>A plastic sensation pressed against my head and my entire body was soaked.</p>



<p>“O-Onii-chan, are you okay?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…So this is what it feels like when a bucket is dumped on you.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>In response to Sana’s voice coming from outside the bucket, I quietly answered.</p>



<p>While it was reassuring that Sana didn’t get hurt, I couldn’t help but wonder why things ended up like this. In the face of this unexpected situation, I was left in a state of mild despair.</p>



<p><em>*Achoo!*</em></p>


<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image4352_8b564f-31 size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/WYSM_v1_12.jpeg?w=1154&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p><em>Sana turned around with a surprised expression, still holding onto my shirt tightly near her face. …What on earth was she doing?</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>“<em>Haa</em>… it’s warm…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Under the warm shower, I let out a relieved sigh. After getting drenched from the bucket, I followed Sana’s suggestion and came to the bathroom to take a shower.</p>



<p>At first, I insisted it was fine, but Sana wouldn’t let it go, warning me that I might catch a cold. Considering it’s still chilly despite being spring, it was probably the right call in the end.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sana is cleaning up the mess from earlier. Fortunately, the water from the bucket didn’t reach the laundry, so we just needed to clean the floor. </p>



<p>Sana kept apologizing for her carelessness, but sincr I was the one who placed a bucket filled with water in such a high place, I was also partly at fault. It was a dumb incident which could have been easily avoided.</p>



<p>“Nh…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I take a shower, I let out a deflated sigh. However, it doesn’t mean my mind is completely blank. In fact, I’ve been using this to think about Sana again.</p>



<p>—Sana is acting strange.</p>



<p>Ever since this morning, she’s been behaving strangely—getting up energetically, preparing breakfast, insisting on doing the household chores herself, and telling me to take a break. These are all actions that are completely out of character for the usual Sana. As her family, it sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>



<p id="no1">She mentioned something about being a domestic sister, but that’s just a cover-up. There must be a reason behind her actions. Don’t underestimate me. <a href="#footnote">In reality, there’s no such thing as a dense protagonist from a light novel. After showing such an unusual behavior, one can’t just go, “I wonder if something happened?” and leave it at that—no one behaves like that.<sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p>Now, as for the cause of why Sana has become like this…</p>



<p>“…………Yeah, I have no idea.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I don’t have any clues. Nothing comes to mind. Why is that?</p>



<p>…I guess it can’t be helped, right? I’m not a dense protagonist, but I’m also not a flawless protagonist who knows everything… Well, in the first place, I’m not even a protagonist. Thinking as if I were the protagonist of a light novel is a common thing for otaku, though.</p>



<p>Setting aside such foolish thoughts, let’s focus on Sana. Based on my six months of experience as her older brother, I suspect that Sana might want me to do something for her. So, she’s trying to appeal to me with household chores and such. I think this assumption is probably correct, but… I don’t know what that “something” is.</p>



<p>If she wants me to do something, I wish she would just tell me straightforwardly. But whether it’s due to shyness or modesty, Sana doesn’t often express such things. Well, she may throw around harsh words, but I think that part of her is quite cute, so I’m fine with it.</p>



<p>“Well, I guess I have to ask directly after all.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Having reached that conclusion, I suddenly noticed a sound coming from the direction of the changing room. Looking over, I saw a silhouette on the semi-transparent glass of the door, and there was a gentle knocking sound.</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan, can you hear me?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, I can hear you! What’s up?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>In response to Sana’s voice, I raised my voice such that she could hear me. After mentioning that she finished cleaning up and apologizing for earlier, she hesitantly said that she had a favor to ask.</p>



<p>“A favor? What is it?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Can you, um, see Sana’s cosplay?” (Sana)</p>



<p>Ah…!</p>



<p>That’s right, cosplay! Sana wanted me to see her cosplay!</p>



<p>On the night of the incident with Yuki, she wanted me to watch her cosplay, but I had to decline. However, with everything that happened afterwards, such as Yuki finding out my identity, Mariel-sama’s buzz, and meeting Serika again, I completely forgot about it and ended up not fulfilling that promise.</p>



<p>Ah, I see. I finally understand now. Actually, it’s entirely my fault for forgetting.</p>



<p>Realizing that Sana had gone through such a roundabout way to get me to remember, I couldn’t help but find my sister adorable. I should have caught on sooner.</p>



<p>Sana enjoys cosplay as a hobby, but she only does it at home and doesn’t participate in events outside. She mentioned that I was the only one she showed her cosplays to. In that sense, I need to properly indulge her whenever I can. I’m looking forward to it.</p>



<p>“Ah, of course it’s fine!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I naturally replied with an enthusiastic agreement. Once I’m done showering, it’s time for Sana’s new cosplay debut. Now that it’s settled, let’s get it over with.</p>



<p>Thinking that, I reached for the body soap, but…</p>



<p>“E-Excuse me (<em>ojamashimasu</em>)…” (Sana)</p>



<p>For some reason, the sound of the bathroom door opening reached my ears, and I reflexively turned around. To my surprise, Sana entered the bathroom, and what was even more shocking was her appearance.</p>



<p>She was wearing something like a sailor uniform on top and a school swimsuit on the bottom!? Wait, is this…!?</p>



<p>“……T-This is the new outfit.” (Sana)</p>



<p>In response to my silence, Sana, while her face was turning bright red, uttered those words.</p>



<p>I hadn’t expected her to showcase a new cosplay outfit here of all places! And the outfit itself… it’s, um, quite different from what she usually wears, isn’t it… Isn’t it more sensitive than usual!?</p>



<p>“…H-How is it? Does it match?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh? M-Match?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, you should know more about this outfit than Sana does.” (Sana)</p>



<p>At first, a bunch of question marks filled my mind, but I quickly realized.</p>



<p>“W-Wait, is this a cosplay of Kirara from ‘Marine Heart’!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Upon hearing my words, Sana nodded. </p>



<p>Marine Heart was a popular mobile game featuring sailor-themed cute girls, and Kirara was one of the characters in the game. Although I secretly played the game myself, I never expected her to cosplay as a character from it. Or rather…</p>



<p>“…Why did you choose to cosplay as a character from Marine Heart?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“W-Well, um… Sana saw you playing it, and…” (Sana)</p>



<p>She saw me!? I thought I was playing it in secret, especially because the game had some sensitive elements.</p>



<p>“It was pretty obvious.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Can’t you refrain from reading my mind!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, that’s because you’re easy to understand. You always had a big grin on your face when playing.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Oh, seriously…? Someone please kill me.</p>



<p>“I-It’s not an erotic game, so I don’t see any problem with playing it! I’m not going to apologize!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…You’re quick to brush it off. And no one asked for an apology.” (Sana)  </p>



<p>“Anyways, why did you decide to cosplay as Kirara?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Eh? W-Well, um… because she’s, you know, cute…” (Sana)</p>



<p>For some reason, Sana averted her gaze while looking embarrassed. Indeed, characters from Marine Heart typically wore cute sailor-themed outfits, and I had heard they were quite popular in the cosplay community. </p>



<p>I calmed down and took a closer look at Sana’s appearance.</p>



<p>No matter how you see it, she’s really cute. Seriously. Sana was already a beauty, but somehow, she seemed even more lovely in the outfit. Not to mention, the quality of her cosplay is top-notch, and the fact that she perfectly recreated Kirara’s costume is amazing.</p>



<p>I was surprised when she suddenly showed up in the bathroom, but putting that aside, I couldn’t help but be impressed by Sana’s talent. Man, my little sister is such an amazing cosplayer, I can’t help but want to show off to everyone.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I think it’s amazing. It suits you well, and you totally look like Kirara.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I nodded in approval, Sana smiled happily. While she isn’t particularly expressive of her thoughts, I loved seeing this particular smile that she only shows when cosplaying.</p>



<p>…Well, that’s all well and good, but we’re in the bathroom, so I’m only wearing a towel on my lower body…! Adding to the awkwardness is the fact that my stepsister is in a sailor swimsuit cosplay. I would really appreciate it if she could leave soon…</p>



<p>“…Thank you. Now, Sana will wash your back, so turn around.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“What!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, instead of leaving, Sana started saying something even more outrageous.</p>



<p>“L-Like I said, Sana is going to wash onii-chan’s back just like in that scene.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“T-That scene? Well, Kirara does have such event scenes but isn’t that a bit too much…?!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Was that scene really that inappropriate?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“No, it’s not like that! While there may be some slightly suggestive elements, that scene is a crucial moment where Kirara truly opens her heart to the captain for the first time! People who don’t understand that often dismiss Marine Heart as an ‘eroge lol,’ but it’s actually a heartfelt game!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…So, there’s no problem. Now, turn around.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh!? Wh-what a clever leading question…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Dismissed with a cold response, I had no choice but to turn my back to Sana.</p>



<p>…The issue isn’t the scene itself, but rather the fact that we’re trying to recreate it. Yet, I can’t help but feel a strange pressure from Sana, and for some reason, I find myself silently complying with her wishes.</p>



<p>“…I-Is this how I do it? What do you think?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, I don’t really know considering it’s my first time having my back washed…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I give Sana a vague answer. While I can feel her earnestly washing my back with the sponge, given the circumstances, I don’t have the composure to offer any coherent feedback.</p>



<p>…Calm down. It’s just an older brother having his younger sister wash his back. But wait, she only became my stepsister just six months ago, right? Ugh, these distracting thoughts…!</p>



<p>“…Um, I get that we’re trying to recreate the scene, but we haven’t done anything like this before. Why the sudden change?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>In order to maintain my composure, I throw out such a question.</p>



<p>While I’ve watched Sana cosplay many times before, I was merely observing, nothing more. So why now?</p>



<p>“…T-That’s, um, because… Sana thought it would be nice to recreate it since it’s a game onii-chan plays…” (Sana)</p>



<p>Wait, does that mean that this wasn’t something she specifically wanted to do, but rather something she did for my sake?</p>



<p>…Strange. From barging into the bathroom to cosplaying characters from games I play, and now reenacting scenes, her actions are out of character. There must be a deeper reason behind it after all, right?</p>



<p>Oh, by the way, if you’re asking whether I’m happy or not, I’d say I’m really happy, especially because she’s doing it for me! But, that’s beside the point right now!</p>



<p>“Hey, Sana, why are you doing this agai—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I turn to ask Sana, but I’m left speechless when I see her.</p>



<p>“…I-I’ll do my best… Because Sana is the domestic type of sister…!” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Hey, Sana!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Sana’s face is bright red, and she’s swaying her head, her eyes seemingly on the verge of rolling back.</p>



<p>…Is she feeling dizzy!? No, it’s not that hot in here! Maybe she’s reached her limit of embarrassment, but if that’s the case, then why did she even start doing this in the first place?!</p>



<p>“Hey, are you okay!? Pull yourself together!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I shake Sana’s shoulders while calling out to her. However, perhaps due to the shaking, the towel wrapped around her waist suddenly falls off.</p>



<p>“Ah…” (Both)</p>



<p>We both let out a surprised gasp, our gazes inadvertently dropping downwards and then quickly snapping back up in unison.</p>



<p>…<em>Kyuu </em>*faints*</p>



<p>“Sanaaaaaaaa!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>And then, Sana collapses—wait, why is this happening!? How did it end up like this!?</p>



<p>I’m left bewildered as I hold up Sana’s limp body. I have no idea how we ended up in this situation. But one thing’s for sure…</p>



<p>…Aren’t lucky moments like this supposed to end the other way around?</p>



<p>……. </p>



<p>“…So, why did you do that?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I ask as I dry my wet hair with a towel.</p>



<p>After that incident, Sana quickly regained consciousness, and we both changed clothes before ending up here, facing each other in the living room. </p>



<p>“If you have any worries or concerns, feel free to tell me. If it’s something I can help with, I’ll do my best.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I wanted to know the reason for all of this, so I asked in a concerned way.</p>



<p>…No matter how you look at it, what happened earlier was definitely over-the-top. It was quite cute though.</p>



<p>“…………” (Sana)</p>



<p>However, Sana only shows a troubled expression without giving an answer. …Hmm, this seems to be quite a deep-rooted issue. As her brother, I must do everything I can to support her.</p>



<p>“Everyone has their own worries. Feel free to talk to me about anything.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“What do you mean by ‘everyone has their own worries’?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Why are you giving me that look?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…<em>Haa</em>, fine. Maybe it’s better to clarify things.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana sighs and then looks straight at me, before opening her mouth to speak.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, how do you feel about being buzzed about?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Huh? Buzzed about? You mean the incident with Yuki and Mariel-sama?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah, the idol and VTuber.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Why are we suddenly talking about that? We were discussing your concerns…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Just answer.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana cuts off my words sharply. Her eyes seem oddly intense… </p>



<p>“Well, it was definitely surprising. They’re both super famous, so getting talked about by them out of the blue is bound to be confusing.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Only surprise and confusion? Could it be you didn’t like it?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Oh, there’s nothing like that. I was surprised, but I’m genuinely happy. After all, they’re both my oshis. Being acknowledged by my oshis is something to be happy about, right?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Yeah, you’re right.” (Sana)</p>



<p>To my response, Sana lowered her head for a moment, pondering something before asking another question.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, you met them in real life, right? How was it?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“How was what?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I mean, how were they as people? I heard that the idol was your classmate and the VTuber was your childhood friend…” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana’s expression seems a bit displeased only when she mentions the parts about being classmates and childhood friends. Anyways, it seems that she’s interested in knowing more about them.</p>



<p>“It’s difficult to describe how it was… Meeting them in real life made me realize that things are totally different from seeing them through a screen. Maybe it feels that way because both of them passionately support me so it feels like our roles are reversed. For example, Yuki usually gives off a cool vibe, but when we met, she was incredibly high-energy.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Really?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, just so you know, I’m not exaggerating!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“No one is doubting you. Besides, after watching the videos that led to the buzz, it’s clear that both of them genuinely support you.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Hmm, so Sana watched the videos of those two as well. It’s surprising considering she didn’t seem interested at first.</p>



<p>“…So onii-chan, does being supported by those two makes you want to give it your all?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Well, of course.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I nodded. To be precise, I feel like I have to give it my all. After being publicly supported by my oshis, I need to make sure that I become a streamer worthy of their support so that I don’t let them down.</p>



<p>“…I see. So, Sana has no choice…” (Sana)</p>



<p>As I responded, Sana muttered softly to herself, seeming lost in thought.</p>



<p>…Wait, what are we talking about? This was supposed to be Sana’s consultation, but somehow the conversation has taken a completely different direction. I tilt my head in confusion, and eventually, Sana lifts her head.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, Sana has a favor to ask.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. You can tell me anything. I’ll do whatever I can to help. Oh but spare me if it’s about wanting me to stop supporting my oshis because I’m creepy or something.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Sana won’t say that. Oni-chan will die if she does.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Wow, sister dearest, you know your brother really well. I was sweating a bit, thinking the conversation might head in that direction after talking about Yuki and Mariel-sama, but thankfully it didn’t.</p>



<p>Well, I’m a little concerned about the slightly stern look she’s giving me, though.</p>



<p>“…The favor is for you to come with Sana to a certain place.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“A certain place? Now? I’m okay with it, but where are we going?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I naturally ask the question, and Sana, with a gaze filled with determination, responds in an unusually clear tone.</p>



<p>“A place where Sana can show her true self.” (Sana)</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Is this the place where you can show your true self…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>And so, the place we arrived at was a rental studio—a facility specifically designed for shooting authentic cosplay photos.</p>



<p>The current room has a gothic atmosphere with a white theme, featuring luxurious sofas and an arch-like structure covered with flowers. As someone who is here for the first time, I find myself constantly looking around in fascination.</p>



<p>“This is the most standard room. There are also rooms with various other themes.” (Sana)</p>



<p>On the other hand, Sana seems accustomed to it. She handled the reservations and interactions at the reception relatively smoothly, so she must has been here before.</p>



<p>Sana instructed me to wait while she left the room with her bag in hand, presumably to change. However, she suddenly turned around and asked in a somewhat formal tone.</p>



<p>“…If Sana cosplay seriously, will you support her?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…? I don’t get it, but I’ll support Sana in whatever she wants to do.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Not fully grasping the intent behind the question, I tilt my head slightly. Well, if it’s about supporting her, I’ve been doing that for a while now.</p>



<p>Upon hearing my answer, Sana seemed relieved and quickly left the room. After watching her leave, I once again take a look around the room.</p>



<p>“…Sana is quite a dedicated cosplayer, huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Cliché and belated words slipped from my lips. …Well, I already knew, but being brought to a place like this made me think about it again.</p>



<p>When I first heard that cosplay was her hobby, I was surprised. But when she showed off her outfit for the first time, I was even more astonished because she looked incredibly cute.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the quality was beyond that of an amateur, so I asked if she was a famous cosplayer. Sana quietly shook her head and mentioned that she used to be on social media a bit, but not anymore.</p>



<p>Her demeanor seemed to suggest there was more to the story, but I didn’t press further. She didn’t seem to want to talk about it, and I could tell that something must have happened in the past. Instead, I just told her that I would be cheering her on. That is how I really feel. When your little sister shows you her cosplay, it’s only natural to want to support her.</p>



<p>While I thought it was a shame that she quit social media, I did have a bit of a desire to boast about my cute sister, but I didn’t tell her about that. Of course, if she ever decides to do it again, I’ll support her decision in whatever way I can.</p>



<p>In summary, for me, Sana is not just my precious stepsister but also an oshi-like cosplayer whom I have been supporting for a while now.</p>



<p>“A serious cosplay, huh? I wonder what it’s going to be like.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I think about Sana, I eagerly wait for her return. After all, she’s going to go all out, right? How can I not be excited?</p>



<p>While I’m lost in my thoughts, I hear the sound of the door opening, and I quickly turn around.</p>



<p>“Welcome back. that took quite some time──” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, I immediately fall silent and freeze. The reason being—</p>



<p>“…Eh, who are you?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Because there, standing before me, is a random magical girl!</p>



<p>No, no, logically speaking, I know that it’s Sana. However, my brain can’t seem to accept that! Because her hairstyle, eye color, and, well, her face are different!</p>



<p>“What are you talking about? You seriously don’t know?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s Sana, right? But… what’s going on…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“It’s been a while since Sana has done serious cosplay.” (Sana)</p>



<p>She says it so casually, but the attention to detail is overwhelming. She looks like a completely different person.</p>



<p>“Is cosplay supposed to change someone this much?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Wig for the hair, colored contacts for the eyes. Makeup and tape can alter the face and contours. Sana don’t usually go to this extent but… Onii-chan, do you recognize this character?” (Sana)</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, I blankly stare at Sana’s transformed appearance once again.</p>



<p id="imagetext">A pink fluffy costume with butterfly-like wings on the back. In her hands, she holds a stick with leaves attached, resembling a branch. Overall, her appearance is reminiscent of a fairy. This is…!</p>



<p>“It’s Lil from [Fairy Princess]!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>[Fairy Princess] is a magical girl anime that gained popularity a few years ago and still holds a strong fan base despite having ended long ago. Lil is the protagonist of the series, this cosplay is a dead-on match. I used to watch it back then, and this genuinely looks like Lil herself!</p>



<p>“That’s amazing. No, it’s seriously incredible. I’m somehow moved…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I gaze at Sana, filled with admiration. While her previous cosplays at home were impressive, this is on a whole different level. Sana, at her best, is truly extraordinary. I don’t know why, but I feel so happy.</p>



<p>“Sana’s glad. Lil was the character that inspired Sana to start cosplaying, so being praised by Onii-chan for it makes her happy…” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Oh, really? I didn’t know that.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Looks likr the character holds a special place in her heart, and that’s reflected in the quality of this cosplay. But seriously, how can one handle such overwhelming cuteness? I feel like shouting right now. I want to proudly boast about her, that’s how cute she is.</p>



<p>“Well then, let’s start the photo shoot.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right. It’s a crime not to capture something like this in a photo.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I definitely want to take countless pictures and preserve this incredibly cute version of Sana for future generations.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, here’s the camera.” (Sana)</p>



<p>However, as I was pondering about that, Sana unexpectedly handed me the camera.</p>



<p>…Huh? Why me?</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, you take the pictures.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Eh? M-Me? Don’t you usually take selfies?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>She always took selfies when cosplaying at home, so why entrust me with the camera now?</p>



<p>“…Just do it. Today, it’s Onii-chan’s turn to take the pictures.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Not the most explanatory answer. Nevertheless, Sana has forcefully designated me as the photographer for today.</p>



<p>Despite being somewhat reluctant, I raise the camera. Even through the lens, Sana looks dangerously cute, creating a genuine illusion that Lil is right there. I don’t know if I can properly capture her charm in the photos, but damn it, I’ve got to try!</p>



<p>With determination, I start photographing Sana in various poses.</p>



<p>Even though I was an amateur at photography, I was fueled by the single-minded desire to capture Sana’s cuteness.</p>



<p>After a while of being completely absorbed in photography, I gradually became more accustomed to it, gaining a bit of composure.</p>



<p>“By the way, why did you suddenly decide to go all out in cosplay today? I mean, I’m thrilled to see this, but what’s the occasion?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Sana’s newfound enthusiasm was delightful, but I was still curious about the reason behind it. If I could understand the catalyst, perhaps there would be more opportunities to do this with Sana.</p>



<p>“Mmm…” (Sana)</p>



<p>However, Sana hesitated for a moment in response to my question.</p>



<p>“…Sana felt like she needed to do it… or something like that.” (Sana)</p>



<p>The explanation was still somewhat cryptic, but I refrained from pressing further.</p>



<p>Because at that moment, Sana’s smile was so precious that I was completely absorbed in capturing it through the lens.</p>



<p>We continued the photo shoot until the rental time was up, and during that time, I reaffirmed my commitment to wholeheartedly support this incredibly adorable sister of mine in whatever she pursued.</p>



<p>The day concluded with my satisfaction at witnessing Sana’s all-out cosplaying. However, the events did not end there. </p>



<p>Later that evening, while I was streaming as usual, something unexpected happened. </p>



<p>I noticed the viewer count rapidly increasing by several thousand, and the comment section was getting rowdier than usual. While wondering if Yuki or Mariel-sama had done something again, I checked the comments and couldn’t believe my eyes.</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [I came from Sana’s tweet!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Is it true that your Sana’s onii-chan?!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Came from Sana!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [First Yuki and Mariel-sama, and now Sana? Who are you?]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [I’m envious of Sana’s onii-chan!]</p>



<p>The comments were flooded with mentions of Sana’s name. Certainly, this was unmistakably my sister’s name, but why is it all over the comment section like this!?</p>



<p>Unable to comprehend what was happening, my confusion grew when my smartphone suddenly rang.</p>



<p>Upon checking, I received a message from Yuki and Serika, and its content left me even more astonished.</p>



<p><strong>Yuki</strong>: [Kei-kun, I had no idea your sister was such a famous person! Her photos are so cute, I’d love to meet her!]</p>



<p><strong>Serika</strong>: [I never heard that your step-sister was such a stunning beauty!? And a popular cosplayer too! What’s the meaning of this!?]</p>



<p>Both of them seemed to be talking about Sana, but I still had no clue about what was happening.</p>



<p>Serika’s message included a URL, leading to a social media profile under the username ‘Sana’. There, alongside familiar photos of a magical girl, was a link to my streaming channel, accompanied by a message: “Onii-chan’s live streaming today. Everyone, please so support him.”</p>



<p>No, wait, these are the photos I took during the day! Moreover, Sana was supposed to have taken a hiatus from social media! Why is she promoting my livestream!?</p>



<p>Numerous question marks popped up in my mind, but soon my attention shifted to the follower count on that account, and any coherent thought vanished.</p>



<p>“F-Followers… T-Thirty thousand…!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand… without a doubt, it’s thirty thousand people…!?</p>



<p>What on earth is happening!? Come to think of it, Yuki and Serika mentioned that she was popular. There’s no way such a massive following could accumulate overnight. She must have achieved these numbers in the past.</p>



<p>“G-Give me a moment!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Unable to keep up with the sudden turn of events, I paused the stream and desperately made my way to Sana’s room next door.</p>



<p>“S-Sana! W-what’s going on!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Noisy. What is it? …Ah, that.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana, emerging from her room, showed a nonchalant reaction upon seeing my smartphone screen.</p>



<p>“Sana decided to resume her activity on social media.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s not about that! Of course, that itself is a good thing! B-But the number of followers…!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…? It’s the same as before. It increased a bit even during the hiatus.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…C-Could it be, Sana-san, are you secretly an incredibly famous cosplayer or something?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Why are you using polite language? Just search it on the internet.” (Sana)</p>



<p>. I proceeded to search on my phone as instructed, and it immediately appeared—charismatic cosplayer, national treasure-level cuteness, reactions from overseas… All compiled on various websites.</p>



<p>“Why didn’t you say anything!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Because you didn’t ask.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Ugh!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…Not knowing something so easily discoverable for half a year!</p>



<p>Although I felt devastated, I somehow managed to accept that Sana was a popular cosplayer. Well, thinking about it, it does make sense. My sister is that cute, after all.</p>



<p>Seeing me in this state, Sana asked with a slightly worried expression.</p>



<p>“…Could it be that onii-chan didn’t want Sana to resume her activities?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…Of course not. If that’s what you want to do, I’ll definitely support you.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…<em>Fuu</em>, that’s a relief.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“But, you know, I have a question… It might seem sudden, but why go as far as promoting my livestream? I don’t get that part.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the real issue. I was surprised and somewhat understanding about her resuming her social media activities. However, I genuinely can’t comprehend this part.</p>



<p>“Is it not okay for Sana to support onii-chan?” (Sana)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s not that it’s not okay, but… if you’re going to do that, did you really have to reveal that we’re siblings to everyone?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>When I mentioned that, Sana pouted slightly and, for some reason, turned her cheek away with a slightly flushed face.</p>



<p>“…Even Sana can make onii-chan go viral.” (Sana)</p>



<p>She mumbled something, but her voice was too soft to hear clearly.</p>



<p>“A-Anyway, since Sana decided to resume her cosplay activities, onii-chan should just continue to support her. Sana will also support onii-chan’s live streams in her own way.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Y-yeah, of course, I’ll support you. But for me…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“That’s a deal then. You’re currently livestreaming, right? It’s not good to leave your viewers unattended for too long. Hurry back.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Saying so, Sana closed the door, leaving me still bewildered.</p>



<p>Left alone, I felt a sense of dissatisfaction and glanced at my smartphone once again.</p>



<p>The revival of Sana’s social media account was genuinely a reason to be happy, but seeing my name trending again and becoming the subject of continuous buzz each day somehow numbed my senses.</p>



<p>“Now even my <em>imouto</em>…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Even when I put it into words, the reality didn’t quite sink in, and for a while, I found myself standing there, unable to do much.</p>



<p>☆</p>



<p>[Sana’s PoV]</p>



<p>Sana started cosplaying because she wanted to become her favorite character.</p>



<p>Though her photos gained widespread attention on social media, and she was even referred to as a popular cosplayer, it didn’t last long. The reason was… something she didn’t want to dwell on.</p>



<p>Sana’s new onii-chan, who came from mom’s remarriage, would always compliment Sana’s cosplay. When she mentioned that she stopped doing serious cosplay, he didn’t ask further. Understanding that he was being considerate made her heart warm. She thought he was a good person.</p>



<p>—”Loving what you do is precious in itself. I do game commentary because I enjoy it. Well, the view counts never really go up though.”</p>



<p>Saying this, onii-chan’s warm laughter made her feel comfortable, and before she realized it, she started to like him. For the first time, she understood what it was like to love someone.</p>



<p>However, expressing those feelings was something she couldn’t do.</p>



<p>Sana wasn’t straightforward, and she was shy. Above all, she was afraid that verbalizing those feelings would make their sibling relationship awkward. </p>



<p>She couldn’t bear the thought of losing this happy life. So, even while watching onii-chan’s streams, she didn’t leave any comments or tell him that she was watching. She only wished they could stay as siblings forever, and that’s all she ever thought about.</p>



<p>However, the situation has changed. She couldn’t keep doing things like that anymore.</p>



<p>The popular idol onii-chan supported turned out to be a fan of his and made him go viral.</p>



<p>The popular VTuber he supported was also the same.</p>



<p>Moreover, these two individuals were classmates and childhood friends, having real-life connections with onii-chan.</p>



<p>Sana couldn’t understand. Why did things turn out like this? She knew that onii-chan was kind, warm, and cool, and it made sense for people to like him once they got to know him. But still, it shouldn’t be on this level.</p>



<p>It was frightening. The thought that onii-chan was about to be taken away made her so scared that she couldn’t bear it.</p>



<p>So, she tried various approaches to grab his attention, but it all failed. The domestic sister strategy, which she came up with, was confusing even to her, and attempting to reenact scenes with cosplay also didn’t work.</p>



<p>However, through these attempts, she realized something. She understood that the opponent she was trying to compete with was an overwhelmingly powerful rival, and there was no way something like this would achieve anything.</p>



<p>Sana could feel their genuine feelings whenever they talked about onii-chan.</p>



<p>If that’s the case, there was no way that she could compete unless she does something just as extreme.</p>



<p>So, Sana went to the studio, did went all-out with her cosplay for the first time in a while..</p>



<p>She then revived her social media account and clearly indicated her support for onii-chan. This was a declaration of her determination. Sana wanted the whole world to know that onii-chan was hers.</p>



<p>“<em>Fuu</em>… I managed to create some buzz properly.” (Sana)</p>



<p>She sighed with relief as she checked her smartphone screen. For now, the plan was a success.</p>



<p>However, Sana understands that the real battle lies ahead. The opponents were influencers of the highest class, both an idol and a VTuber, and they were onii-chan’s oshis. Formidable opponents.</p>



<p>“But… I won’t lose.” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana dives onto the bed. There, she notices the shirt she had onii-chan (somewhat forcibly) given her this morning. She pulls it towards her, embracing it tightly.</p>



<p>Bringing her nose close, she inhaled the scent, a mixture of detergent and onii-chan’s fragrance made her head feel blissfully fuzzy.</p>



<p>“Hah…” (Sana)</p>



<p>A faint voice escapes her lips. That’s how happy she felt. She loved that scent.</p>



<p>While holding the shirt even tighter, she thought to herself:</p>



<p>—Onii-chan belongs to Sana. Sana won’t give him to anyone else. She’s not going to lose because…</p>



<p>“…Onii-chan is Sana’s first oshi!” (Sana)</p>

<p><em>A pink fluffy costume with butterfly-like wings on the back. In her hands, she holds a stick with leaves attached, resembling a branch. Overall, her appearance is reminiscent of a fairy. This is…!</em></p>
