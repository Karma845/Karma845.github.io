<h3>Chapter 16: Michiba Rokka</h3>



<p> <br />Toudou slowly walked towards me.<br /> <br />I thought he was going to talk to me, but he passed me by and stood in front of the blackboard. He picked up a piece of chalk, then stopped moving.<br /> <br />Toudou, you’re helpless because you’re alone. In our class, I was the only one who became friends with you. Coming up to the blackboard changes nothing.<br /> <br />Completely, if he had just honestly apologized to me and made up, it would have been nice. The end of term exams are coming up soon too, so I wanted to revive the study sessions as well.<br /> <br />I felt sorry for Toudou sitting all alone, so I thought I’d let him into my group.<br /> <br />To be honest, I think the karaoke incident was a joke taken a bit too far. But you can’t have fun in school life without reading the atmosphere properly.<br /> <br />He’s so stubborn and headstrong. We should make up already.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />During the group divisions, seeing Toudou cowering there, he looked a little pitiful.<br /> <br />…Well, it was my fault too, but I never thought Toudou wouldn’t get the joke at all.<br /> <br />He was all nervous when I approached him in the library. He must have totally had a crush on me, right? That’s why he got angry and went home at the karaoke place…<br /> <br />If I let him into my group, he’ll go back to being the nice sensei again, right?<br /> <br />–I don’t like scary Toudou. The reason he got angry in the classroom because he wanted to bother me, right? Don’t worry, we’re friends.<br /> <br />When Toudou waited for me at the karaoke place, I was really happy. He waited for me–<br /> <br />After the joke, I was going to spoil him.<br /> <br />But no matter how long it’s been, Toudou is still angry. I thought he’d apologize if I gave her the cold shoulder…he wouldn’t even look me in the eye.<br /> <br />My temper snapped because I was frustrated…Toudou’s atmosphere in the classroom was very scary…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Was it no good to keep her waiting for two hours?<br /> <br />For a student, that level of joke is normal, right.<br /> <br />…I’ve had even worse done to me.<br /> <br />Hey, Toudou. Have you ever had water poured on you in the bathroom?<br /> <br />Been completely ignored out of the blue by friends you were chatting with just moments before?<br /> <br />Had your gym clothes ripped to shreds?<br /> <br />Been forced to confess to a boy you don’t even like?<br /> </p>







<p> <br />No one took my side. It starts suddenly and ends just as suddenly. Just bullying disguised as a joke. After me, a different student becomes the next target. A nasty routine that only girls understand.<br /> <br />Even though it was only a month, I never wanted to trust people again.<br /> <br />I don’t have any friends in this class. We’re just connected because we’re crammed into this small space.<br /> <br />But–<br /> <br />Lunch break with Toudou was different.<br /> <br />At first I thought I could use him. Having him teach me would be convenient, I thought. You were completely different from the other students. I started looking forward to going to this school I hated so much. I started looking forward to lunch break.<br /> <br />He’s smart yet spacey in a rare way, and his occasional smile is really beautiful…<br /> <br />I envied Toudou. I wanted to be such a pure child.<br /> <br />Yet–<br /> <br />Toudou said he didn’t want to go out with just the two of us. …I was frustrated. He always went out with Hanazono.<br /> <br />You want to be mean to the girl you’re interested in, right? That’s normal, isn’t it?<br /> <br />I thought Toudou would understand that much. In the library he was so kind, yet suddenly turned cold. That’s awful for a guy.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Doesn’t want to teach me anymore…too lonely…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Toudou moved and wrote his name on the blackboard. He didn’t belong to any group. He was in the corner of the blackboard. The next moment, Toudou drew an X through her name.<br /> <br />“Huh…?”<br /> <br />Putting down the chalk, without speaking to anyone he started talking.<br /> <br />“Well then, I’m leaving this class. …Actually, a while ago, a teacher recommended I move to the special class. I want to try living more sincerely. Maybe I can change more. –Well then, I’m going to the faculty office to take care of the paperwork. Oh, Sasaki san, thank you for always lending me books. Don’t worry, we can meet anytime. Please come play with me and Igarashi san.”<br /> <br />Special class!? Whoa, things like entertainment, sports, or really excellent academic ability…a frame separate from normal classes where the numbers are counted differently…<br /> <br />“W-wait a minute…! I won’t allow that…!”<br /> <br />“Hmm, you have no right to speak out against my decisions.”<br /> <br />“But still…we’re friends…”<br /> <br />“Excuse me, I don’t have any memories like that.”<br /> <br />“Ah…”<br /> <br />Toudou isn’t looking at me. There’s nothing in his eyes. Meanwhilw he looks at Sasaki with a kind gaze–<br /> <br />Why not me? We were always together, weren’t we!?<br /> <br />During that awful month when my classmates played mean jokes on me, I kept feeling terrible. That feeling comes back now. Lonely, miserable, frustrated, at a total loss, on the verge of tears but holding them back…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Toudou leaving the silent classroom. I could only watch his large back.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The unpleasant feeling swirling in my stomach.<br /> <br />The moment I realized the sin I had committed.<br /> <br />The sense that I had broken something irreplaceable myself.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I did something awful…<br /> <br />Spilled water won’t flow back. The time we spent together in the library won’t come back again. Since we stopped the study sessions, I kept remembering him whenever lunch break came around. It was fun. I wanted to be with him. He was an important friend. Why did I have to be mean? Why did I do that…?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Toudou kun–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My voice alone echoed in the silent classroom.</p>





<h3>Chapter 17: I’m Not the Only One Moving Forward</h3>



<p> <br />I headed straight for the faculty office after leaving the classroom, and spoke to the homeroom teacher who was preparing for the next class.<br /> <br />When I conveyed my intention to move to the special class, the teacher seemed happy. It was because a student from his class could go to the special class.<br /> <br />I don’t really need anything special. I just want to be a normal student. But choosing to move to the special class was my own decision too.<br /> <br />“By the way, the special class, where?”<br /> <br />“Toudou…use polite language with teachers.”<br /> <br />“Excuse my rudeness. Where is the special class?”<br /> <br />“…You have a way of speaking unlike a high school student. I’ll give you the paperwork later so fill it out. After processing, you’ll be moved. Probably around a week.”<br /> <br />“O-okay, I understand.”<br /> <br />“…Polite language.”<br /> <br />“Y-yes sir…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I see, I can’t move right away after all…<br /> <br />“…which is understandable.”<br /> <br />Still, it seems I can transfer by next week.<br /> <br />Apparently, the teachers had a vague sense of my abnormality. Despite trying to take it easy, my occasional displays of academic and athletic abilities must have triggered something.<br /> <br />I see, it’s a school with many outstanding adults.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Upon the teacher’s suggestion, I took a test only once. It wasn’t a particularly difficult test. In the past, I wouldn’t have bothered taking it seriously. I thought standing out would make school life difficult.<br /> <br />After the date with Hanazono, I felt a change in myself. I decided to take the test seriously.<br /> <br />I remember the teacher looking astonished at the test results.<br /> <br />Did I go too far?<br /> <br />However, the questions were too easy. They were the kind I solved back in elementary school.<br /> <br />After the test, the teacher recommended that I join a special class. A class for students with exceptional abilities to comfortably navigate school life.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I don’t know whether I can trust “adults” or not.<br /> <br />They did try to break me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />…I understand in my head that the teachers at this school are different.<br /> <br />But I can’t forget the memories left in my heart. Still, I intend to move forward. I’ll blindly believe, and if I get betrayed, I can’t do anything about it. Nothing left but to give up.<br /> <br />Leaving the faculty office, I returned to my classroom. I’m still enrolled in that class…<br /> <br />I stand in front of the classroom door. It’s extremely hard to enter.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–This must be what’s called “awkward.” I see, good experience for me to learn from. If I was going to the special class and ran out of the classroom, only fifteen minutes have passed.<br /> <br />…Even though I ruined the class atmosphere and ran out, going back to the classroom like nothing happened is very embarrassing.<br /> <br />What do I do–Calm down.<br /> <br />Since the corporate visit is scheduled with the special class, there’s no need for me to join the group divisions. They said I can go to the special class alone even if I don’t attend…I wonder if Tanaka will go too? I’m looking forward to going together with Tanaka, which surprises me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Okay, I’ll sneak into the classroom. Conceal my presence. My specialty.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I tried to erase my presence by emptying my mind, the door opened naturally. The baseball club’s Yamada with the protruding forehead was there. What a…<br /> <br />“Yo, you came back! Dude, that’s awesome! A special class, man! They say it’s harder to get into than Tokyo University! Was it ’cause you were teaching Rokka? You were smart after all! I should’ve had you teach me!”<br /> <br />Next to him is the soccer club’s Haruki, good friends with Yamada and one of the leaders of the class.<br /> <br />“Yamada~ keep your voice down. Toudou’s embarrassed right? Hey, Toudou, come on in already.”<br /> <br />It’s long homeroom now. After the group divisions are decided, it’ll be self-study.<br /> <br />My classmates are having casual chatter while opening their textbooks.<br /> <br />The shy Sasaki-san, not caring about standing out, toddled up to me.<br /> <br />“…Um, Toudou kun…I…I’m useless…s-sorry…”<br /> <br />Sasaki-san’s friends watched her warmly. Sasaki-san is loved after all. It must be because she looks like a hamster.<br /> <br />“It’s not Sasaki-san’s fault. It was just that I didn’t tell you I was going to the special class.”<br /> <br />“Y-you’re going right away?”<br /> <br />“…No, within next week. Sasaki-san, thank you for talking to me. I’m happy.”<br /> <br />“I-I was scared of Toudou so even though our seats are next to each other I couldn’t talk to you– I wanted the whole class to know what a great person Toudou is but…I couldn’t do anything at all…”<br /> <br />“It’s fine. It was my fault for not being able to talk to our classmates well. But I was able to become friends with Sasaki-san and Igarashi…Oh, is it okay if I decide Sasaki-san and I are friends? Can I decide that on my own? “<br /> <br />“It’s okay, you and I are friends Toudou. Oh, Fujie wanted to talk to Toudou too! She said it’d be good if we were in the same group too! If only I could’ve discussed it sooner–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Human relationships are difficult. Even for someone like Sasaki-san, one mistake could lead to a lot of trouble. So it can’t be helped that Sasaki-san was hesitating. I’m grateful to Sasaki-san and Igarashi.<br /> <br />I was able to physically feel what is called “normal youth.” Watching Sasaki-san and Igarashi makes my back tingle. It was an experience I couldn’t get just from reading books.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–I wonder if I can experience it someday?<br /> <br />The memory of holding hands with Hanazono surfaces. Tanaka’s scent brings back memories. I gently shake my head and smile at Sasaki-san.<br /> <br />“—Sasaki-san. This is school. We can meet anytime. Please come visit with Igarashi. Of course, I’ll visit you too. Oh, when Sasaki-san talks about Igarashi, her emotional fluctuations settle down. Youth is wonderful.”<br /> <br />Sasaki looked at my face—frozen.<br /> </p>



<p>What’s going on? I thought she’d return the joke. Did I mess up again?<br /> <br />“Toudou-kun, your smiling face is really wonderful. …Definitely show it to Hanazono-san and Tanaka-san, okay?”<br /> <br />I breathed a sigh of relief. I hadn’t made a mistake. It might be a small thing, but I guess I’ve grown. So, I was able to smile.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When Sasaki-san and I tried to go back to our seats, some of my classmates called out to me. Apparently everyone was worried about me according to Sasaki-san. No, it’s thanks to Sasaki-san. They got to know me through Sasaki-san.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Whoa, Toudou’s more normal than I thought! Who spread the rumor about him beating up delinquents?”<br /> <br />“There’s those guys who always hang around the convenience store right? It was them.”<br /> <br />“And he became a super hottie recently right? It’s not just my imagination right? Is he going out with Hanazono?”<br /> <br />“I heard he’s close with someone from the special class?”<br /> <br />“Toudou, teach me studying! I don’t get this problem!”<br /> <br />“Idiot, don’t break the atmosphere! And you’re the only one way behind! Cut that out!”<br /> <br />“Hey, that smile from earlier–deadly right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah yeah, if I was smiled at like that, well…”<br /> <br />“I can see why Rokka fell for him…whoops, it slipped out, heh.”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />My head spins as I deal with the problems.<br /> <br />“I’m just aiming to be normal. I dislike violence but need to brush off the sparks that land on me sometimes. Hanazono picks my outfits for me. Hanazono is a precious friend, not a romantic partner. Tanaka is a precious friend too. I’ll have to decline teaching you studying, I don’t want to cause trouble. So I was scary? If we pass each other in the hall, just talk to me normally. Sasaki-san is a good person. I don’t really understand about the smile. I must just be happy. I know what you mean by deadly, but what does it mean in this case? Rokka…Michiba’s thing. All my memories with Michiba are gone now. It’s irrelevant now.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />This was the most I had ever spoken at once. My classmates froze for a moment, but then laughed. That laughter didn’t feel like they were making fun of me. I sensed some kind of warm air.<br /> <br />My classmates saw me through Sasaki-san.<br /> <br />I see, so the act of laughing can let off stress. It wasn’t an act that hurt.<br /> <br />A few students aren’t laughing. It’s mostly the members from the karaoke incident. I don’t need to worry about it.<br /> <br />Although I had been avoiding looking, Michiba had been crying the whole time. Not fake tears. I can feel the surge of emotion from Michiba. Uncontrollable sobs reach my ears.<br /> <br />There is no one around Michiba.<br /> <br />I don’t really understand why she’s crying. I haven’t spoken properly to Michiba.<br /> <br />However, it seems I made her cry somehow. Did I do something wrong?<br /> <br />Michiba played mean jokes on me.<br /> <br />And my feelings for her have been reset.<br /> <br />Small problems grow big. Early response increases speed of problem resolution.<br /> <br />Human relationships must be the same I guess.<br /> <br />Regardless what happened, it doesn’t feel good seeing a girl cry.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Instead of sitting at my seat, I approached Michiba.<br /> <br />Michiba’s face I saw when she looked up was drenched in tears and snot.<br /> <br />I didn’t understand. I haven’t spoken to Michiba much.<br /> <br />I just conveyed my intentions.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Don’t scare her. Do it like when talking to Hanazono.<br /> <br />“Why is Michiba crying?”<br /> <br />“–Sniff, I-I’m not crying. …Sniff, b-because…Toudou…”<br /> <br />“Me? I was sure I cut off all ties with Michiba.”<br /> <br />“W-why are you so cold… You’re mad because I was mean right. S-sorry, I’ll apologize–s-sorry–“<br /> <br />“No, there’s no need to apologize. Somehow I seem to have made you cry right? It’s my fault. I couldn’t take your meanness justa as a joke. It hurt me so much I thought I should erase the memories. So it’s not Michiba’s fault.”<br /> <br />“I-it’s my fault, I shouldn’t have been mean–“<br /> <br />“I’m sorry–“<br /> <br />“No, why are you apologizing…W, Why You can’t hate me…why are you so kind! I’m the one who deceived you! Blame me– “<br /> <br />“I can’t–“<br /> <br />“Ah, if you don’t blame me–I, I–I shouldn’t have been mean…I’m…let me apologize…please…it hurts… “<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In my head, I try to piece together my past experiences.<br /> <br />–Michiba is regretting what she did. Lashing out at me with malice. I understand she’s referring to the karaoke incident. I reset my feelings towards Michiba. She became an unrelated person to me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My study session with Michiba. She had a terrible headache and her study methods were awful. I couldn’t help but blurt it out.<br /> <br />Michiba said [You’re plain but amazing! Hey, teach me how to study!] with sparkling eyes.<br /> <br />She makes mean jokes but Michiba, who is cheerful and free-spirited, is full of humanity. I have a memory of her being a lovely person. But I don’t have any emotions attached to it.<br /> <br />I must have enjoyed talking with Michiba too.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–That’s why the intense malice pierces my heart like a sharp blade. The difference ripped my heart apart.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />If I reset everything, is it really over? I ask myself.<br /> <br />“Um, are you really going to the advanced class?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I talked to the teacher. I’ll be leaving this class next week.”<br /> <br />“Wha, is it because of me? Because I’m in this class?”<br /> <br />I tilt my head in puzzlement. She’s misunderstanding.<br /> <br />“It has nothing to do with you, Michiba. I’m going to the advanced class by my own will.”<br /> <br />“But, let me apologize–please–I, I–I won’t interact with Toudo anymore–“<br /> <br />Michiba’s breathing becomes ragged. She’s hyperventilating a little. It’s not a good state.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Michiba–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I’ll speak from the heart.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I was really looking forward to going to karaoke with my classmates. I was happy to be invited since I don’t have friends. So thank you for inviting me. But I…was left alone waiting and felt very lonely.”<br /> <br />“Oh…”<br /> <br />Michiba’s face pales. Her body trembles. Her body temperature seems to be dropping. She has an expression like she’s being crushed by her own sin.<br /> <br />I can’t find the right words to express myself. There must be different words I could say.<br /> <br />…Michiba was the first classmate to become friends with me. That fact remains.<br /> <br />I was happy we could study together. Even if she was just a convenient friend who would teach me, that was fine. I could feel normalcy.<br /> <br />I’m grateful to Michiba. –Even if I reset my emotions, I won’t forget my gratitude.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I told Michiba to, ‘Don’t get involved with the me.’ The Michiba also told me, ‘Don’t get involved with me anymore.’<br /> <br />“Y-yeah…”<br /> <br />Michiba’s nose is dripping, on the verge of staining her uniform. I take out a handkerchief.<br /> <br />I wipe Michiba’s face with the handkerchief.<br /> <br />“–Ah! T-Toudo…”<br /> <br />I simply hand the handkerchief over to Michiba.<br /> <br />“Michiba. Being told not to interact makes me feel lonely. It leaves a hole in my heart. …So I won’t say that anymore.”<br /> <br />“But, I, I can’t interact with Toudo. I trampled all over Toudo’s feelings…got carried away…I’m sorry…please let me…it hurts…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Ah, I’m sorry, but I don’t want to feel that way again. Still, people can grow.<br /> <br />Even I, without Hanazono–<br /> <br />I took out another handkerchief from my pocket. Tears and runny nose that couldn’t be wiped away with just one.<br /> <br />I gently handed it to the Michiba. I said what I was thinking.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Even if we don’t have our study group, someday, when you can forgive yourself… invite me to karaoke.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Michiba’s sobs become more intense.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Higu…… Higu…… , and, Toudou, I’m sorry…… I……… Hurt…… I’m sorry…… I, Higu “<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I hadn’t intended to talk to Michiba, but ended up pouring my emotions out to her. I don’t know if this is a good or bad outcome.<br /> <br />But strangely, my chest feels refreshed. Michiba tightly grips my handkerchief, openly sobbing like a child without regard for onlookers.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18: What is Love</h3>



<p> <br />I’ll be moving to the advanced class next week.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The advanced class building is a short distance away from here. It’s an insignificant distance.<br /> <br />After school on the courtyard bench. Me, Hanazono and Tanaka were waiting for each other. Watching the students prepare for their club activities.<br /> <br />Even though we’re the same students, those in clubs spend a long time at the academy. Sweating together with their friends. It’s youth. Those of us in the go-home club can’t experience the broadened perspective.<br /> <br />There was a time when I wavered between getting a part-time job or joining a club.<br /> <br />In the end, I chose to work part-time also as a learning experience about society. After working part-time, I understood how tough work is. I felt the workplace had a similar atmosphere to school.<br /> <br />I realized that the academy functions as a microcosm of society.<br /> <br />“It’s comforting that Tanaka is in the same class. …Tsuyoshi, I’m glad for you.”<br /> <br />“Yeah…it would’ve been better if Hanazono was in the advanced class too.”<br /> <br />My honest feelings. Although Tanaka will be there, going to an unfamiliar building makes me uneasy.<br /> <br />“No way. My grades are just average and I can only do mediocre in sports.”<br /> <br />“Then, as my escort–“<br /> <br />“What are you saying? …You’ll be fine without me. Even if you make mistakes, you can move forward.”<br /> <br />Hanazono’s beautiful smiling face.<br /> <br />I don’t have interest in people’s beauty or ugliness. Faces of people called celebrities all look the same to me.<br /> <br />I can’t develop affinity through a screen. But Hanazono looks very beautiful right now. Why is that?<br /> <br />“Yo! Sorry for the wait!! Since I don’t have work today, we can finally go home together!”<br /> <br />Tanaka came jogging lightly towards us.<br /> <br />Hanazono waves her hand at Tanaka.<br /> <br />“Haru, good work! Oh wait…your hair isn’t messy today?”<br /> <br />“Hehe, I had a great nap…rushed here straight after waking up!”<br /> <br />“Geez, don’t sleep during class. Huh? Toudo, what’s wrong?”<br /> <br />Hanazono brushes Tanaka’s hair with a comb. Tanaka doesn’t resist even though she appears bothered.<br /> <br />I gaze at the two of them.<br /> <br />For some reason, my heart rate goes up. …An unfamiliar emotion bubbles up faintly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Is this the feeling of affection towards friends? Certainly, it resembles the affection I once held for Hanazono, but.<br /> <br />It’s a little different from that time’s emotion. In the first place, the similar emotions I had for–Igarashi and Sasaki too. Just what is this feeling called affection? I’ll organize it in a notebook when I get home.<br /> <br />Tanaka crashes into me with her body. Tanaka’s gentle scent gently wraps around me.<br /> <br />It makes me feel sleepy.<br /> <br />“Hehe, Toudo, see you tomorrow! I’m looking forward to it!”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“Huh, are you listening? Haru is talking to you!?”<br /> <br />“Oh, sorry, I’m a little…sleepy.”<br /> <br />When I say that, Tanaka places her hand on my forehead worriedly.<br /> <br />“Toudo, are you okay? Do you have a fever?”<br /> <br />The cool sensation of her hand feels nice. But for some reason, I become very embarrassed.<br /> <br />What is this feeling…I look at Hanazono with a troubled face.<br /> <br />“Hanazono, help me…”<br /> <br />“Hmph, don’t know. Anyway, it’s rare to see you get embarrassed.”<br /> <br />“Doesn’t seem like he has a fever! And getting embarrassed? I don’t get it at all!”<br /> <br />“Look, his ear tips are a little red. Proof that Tsuyoshi is embarrassed.”<br /> <br />I didn’t even know about that fact…Hanazono sure knows a lot about me.<br /> <br />“Got it, Hanazono!”<br /> <br />I stand up from the bench and brace myself. …No problem.<br /> <br />“Hmm, it’s about tomorrow’s d-date.”<br /> <br />“Huh!? It was a date!?”<br /> <br />Tanaka looks at Hanazono in surprise. I also look at Hanazono in confusion.<br /> <br />“Don’t look at me like that you two! When two people go out together, it’s a date! Tsuyoshu, stop fidgeting!”<br /> <br />Hanazono stands up from the bench and starts walking. Tanaka and I follow behind. There is no conversation between us. But for some reason, it felt like Tanaka’s distance was about ten centimeters closer than usual.<br /> <br />My heart beats faster. What is this feeling?<br /> <br />I notice Tanaka looking at my profile.<br /> <br />“…Oh, I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s date…”<br /> <br />Quieter than usual, but her voice resonates directly in my head.<br /> <br />“Y-yeah, I’ll handle it properly–“<br /> <br />I feel like it’s been a while since I’ve used that phrase–<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Walking home with Hanazono scolding us without saying anything…<br /> <br />“–So that’s why I decided to go to the advanced class.”<br /> <br />I explain my circumstances objectively, eliminating emotion.<br /> <br />“I see, in the end Toudo was able to talk normally with his classmates. That’s great!”<br /> <br />“Michiba…that girl really is stupid. But…I can’t really badmouth her.”<br /> <br />“Hanazono, she’s not stupid.”<br /> <br />“…Annoying. Anyway, will this make Michiba become obedient?”<br /> <br />“Hmm, it’s hard to say at this point. The probability is around 50%. Because for someone to change, they likely have to change something fundamental.”<br /> <br />That applies to myself as well.<br /> <br />“–Fundamental? I don’t get it.”<br /> <br />Tanaka tilts her head puzzledly. Yes, very cute.<br /> <br />I continue explaining.<br /> <br />“We’re already high schoolers. We can’t forcibly change someone’s established personality. Even with strong willpower from the person themselves it’s difficult. I think it’s that robust.”<br /> <br />“But, with that Michiba will–“<br /> <br />“I didn’t understand the reason, but Michiba san’s mental state was down. That moment would have been the perfect timing to uplift her spirits.”<br /> <br />Weak creatures cling to words of salvation. I was no different. If, even then, Michiba san didn’t change, it wouldn’t matter to me… No, I should just remember the memories I shared with her. Besides, it’ll be okay. The Michiba san in the memories spent in the library had a nice smile. I don’t know what emotions accompanied it. I don’t know how I felt. But it’ll be okay.<br /> <br />“That, rather than saying she changed…”<br /> <br />“Well, let’s leave Michiba san to Toudou, okay? By the way, Hana-chan, that strap is cute! Look, because I’m like this, cute things don’t suit me, right?”<br /> <br />I react to those words. Shooting a sharp gaze at Tanaka.<br /> <br />“Why? Cute things suit Tanaka because she’s cute. Oh, s-sorry. That just slipped out–“<br /> <br />My inner thoughts spilled out.<br /> <br />“Hyah!? Toudo, that’s embarrassing!”<br /> <br />“S-sorry about that.”<br /> <br />Tanaka and I silently look down.<br /> <br />Hanazono sighs at us with narrowed eyes.<br /> <br />“Geez, why don’t you two flirt already! Toudo, Tanaka is obviously cute right! She’s different from me!”<br /> <br />“No, Hanazono is cute too.”<br /> <br />“Idiot! Don’t say weird stuff!”<br /> <br />Contrary to her energetic words, Hanazono looked just a tiny bit sad.<br /> <br />Am I imagining things?<br /> <br />“–Got it.”<br /> <br />I feel silent pressure from Hanazono as we walk home…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Well, I’m going this way! See you tomorrow!”<br /> <br />Tanaka waves at us as Hanazono and I see her off.<br /> <br />Hanazono has been quiet since earlier. Did something unpleasant happen? I’m starting to get a little worried.<br /> <br />“Then Hanazono, I’ll leave the final check of the date plan to you.”<br /> <br />“Ah, yeah… anyway, you’ll be fine.”<br /> <br />“Is that so? But I’ll feel uneasy without Hanazono there.”<br /> <br />“Just go.”<br /> <br />Hanazono mutters without energy. I’m worried about Hanazono’s mental state. The reason is unknown to me.<br /> <br />But I can’t move forward without asking. As I walk, I think about how to talk with Hanazono.<br /> <br />“Really, it’ll be fine. It’ll definitely work out better than me…I’m different from you two.”<br /> <br />“Hanazono? What are you saying?”<br /> <br />“No, don’t mind me. Anyway, you like Haru, right?”<br /> <br />–Like? Thinking about Tanaka makes me feel fluffy. Just being together makes me happy. I look forward to tomorrow’s date. I don’t find it troublesome.<br /> <br />“I don’t know.”<br /> <br />“See, your ears are red. And you’re a little agitated right?”<br /> <br />“What the…”<br /> <br />Certainly, talking about Tanaka makes my heart rate go up. It makes me feel a little embarrassed. Is this what this feeling called “like” is?<br /> <br />“I don’t understand.”<br /> <br />“Geez, even if you don’t get it, I can tell! Who do you think has been with you all these years!”<br /> <br />In my memory it’s been four years. Before I can say that, Hanazono speaks rapidly.<br /> <br />“Okay? At the end of the date tomorrow, confess to Haru! You two were close at your part-time job right! It’ll definitely be fine!”<br /> <br />Confess…the act Hanazono tried to get me to do. I ended up trampling all over Hanazono’s feelings.<br /> <br />I couldn’t express myself at all. My chest doesn’t hurt. But a murky feeling wells up. As I search for words, we arrive at my house.<br /> <br />“Contact me after the date ends.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’ll be waiting.”<br /> <br />Hanazono doesn’t move. She stays looking down. I hear the sound of deep breaths. Hanazono looks up. Her eyes were striking. I feel the strength of her strong will.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–You’ll be fine now.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That’s all Hanazono says before briskly walking to her own home. Her back looked strangely lonely. But I don’t feel anything. …I shoudn’t feel anything but the murkiness doesn’t disappear.</p>



<h3>Chapter 19: Date</h3>



<p> <br />Today is the date with Tanaka. Based on Hanazono’s advice, I arrive at the meeting spot a little early. Preparations are perfect. My hair is styled with wax. And I’m wearing the clothes Hanazono picked out. As long as I don’t say or do anything weird, there shouldn’t be any issues.<br /> <br />I’m a little concerned about yesterday’s Hanazono, but I can’t let it interfere with today’s date. I’ll talk to Hanazono after the date ends. That’s what I thought.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />15 minutes before the promised time. I wait for Tanaka at the meeting place I used for my date with Hanazono before. This time there’s no sight of any weird foreigners.<br /> <br />I suddenly remember something unpleasant. I waited for Michiba at the karaoke place for two hours. At that time, I felt lonely and sad. I doubted if it was my own mistake. It was Michiba’s malice in the name of a joke.<br /> <br />I don’t know if Michiba can become normal. I’m far from ordinary myself. The human heart is difficult.<br /> <br />Even so, will Tanaka properly come see me?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Huh? Toudo, you’re early! Hehe, good morning!”<br /> <br />Sooner than I expected, Tanaka showed up at the meeting spot.<br /> <br />I should be used to seeing her in casual clothes from our part-time job. But today she looks fashionable.<br /> <br />“Good morning, Tanaka. Y-you, your clothes today are very cute than usual. …Oh, my bad, disregard that. Tanaka herself looks cuter today.”<br /> <br />Indeed, Tanaka was very cute. Her eye-catching blonde hair also looks great with casual clothes. She’s very beautiful. I couldn’t find the words to express it.<br /> <br />“Happy to hear! Look, follow me Toudo!”<br /> <br />“What? But according to the plans after this, I have to wa-wait here Tanaka–“<br /> <br />Tanaka takes my arm. I feel Tanaka’s scent and warmth through my body.<br /> <br />I was so shocked that I couldn’t make a sound. My heart rate jumped up. No, that doesn’t matter. If this continues, my actions will deviate from the plan. That would be troublesome.<br /> <br />“Okay, I’ll go to the juice cafe. But until then, keep me company!”<br /> <br />“Ta, Tanaka”<br /> <br />I was pushed on the back by Tanaka and began walking into town.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Just walking around, why does she have such a happy expression on her face? It’s only a five minute walk to the juice cafe, our destination.<br /> <br />The flowing scenery all seemed fresh. It was different from my date with Hanazono, Tanaka was more carefree.<br /> <br />“Let’s go to the pet shop in the shopping center first!”<br /> <br />“The pet shop? Is that a place for dates?”<br /> <br />“Just come, hurry!”<br /> <br />Tanaka held my hand the whole time. I don’t know much about relationships between men and women. Is it okay to hold hands? She doesn’t seem bothered by it, so I’ll leave that matter on hold.<br /> <br />However, in my date plan… No, the plan is gone now. It’s the same as tests. If you cram at the last minute, cracks will show when unpredictable situations arise.<br /> <br />That’s my current state. Still, I had a good talk with Hanazono and studied. I must have gained some experience points.<br /> <br />–Spend time enjoying myself with Tanaka. That’s all I need to think about. Throw away the plan. It’s like the survival training in the forest during elementary school.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I headed to the shopping center, pulled along by Tanaka.<br /> <br />There were lots of puppies and kitties in the pet shop.<br /> <br />My heart hasn’t stopped pounding this whole time. This heart rate isn’t healthy.<br /> <br />“Ah, a Pomeranian! So cute!”<br /> <br />“Yes, many have bold personalities but are very fluffy and cute.”<br /> <br />“Does Toudou like animals?”<br /> <br />“Yes, I love them.”<br /> <br />I do like animals. They don’t need to have complicated emotions like humans.<br /> <br />Someday I’d like to live with a dog.<br /> <br />“I’m a dog person. Does Toudou like cats or dogs more?”<br /> <br />“I… like both.”<br /> <br />Dogs were my friends. Cats were also my friends. But they’re gone now. It’s a very sad thing, yet I don’t feel anything now. Even searching my memories, I just know the fact that we were together. There are no emotions remembered.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Suddenly, I sensed something by my feet.<br /> <br />A small dog tied to a leash was squirming around my feet.<br /> <br />“Woof woof, ruff ruff… Bow wow, bow wow, woof woof, woof woof!”<br /> <br />“Pugsuke!? No way!!”<br /> <br />“…Hime? And this dog is…”<br /> <br />Hime, whom I met in the night streets, stood there. …Even though she was this close, I couldn’t sense her presence. Why? Was it because I was with Tanaka and felt at ease?<br /> <br />“Oh, hahaha, I saw Toudou’s figure, so I approached, but oh dear, you’re with a girl.”<br /> <br />“Ah, he’s my dear friend Tanaka. Tanaka, this lady here… um, the name…”<br /> <br />I don’t remember the name. …I only know her as Hime. This is troublesome.<br /> <br />“Oh, hahaha, you still haven’t remembered my name, huh… well, it can’t be helped. My name is Sumire Hiratsuka.”<br /> <br />I see, remembered. I probably won’t forget unless something significant happens.<br /> <br />“Um, I’m Haru Tanaka. N-Nice to meet you.”<br /> <br />“It feels so stiff. Anyway, I’m gonna go because I’m intruding! Enjoy yourselves!”<br /> <br />Hime was about to head towards the back of the pet shop, holding the dog, but for some reason, she stopped.<br /> <br />She came back towards me, gently handing over the dog she was carrying.<br /> <br />“W-Why did you give the dog? W-What should I do? It’s incredibly cute, but am I holding it right? I read about it in a book—”<br /> <br />“Okay, okay, then, Haru, get closer to Toudou. Since we’re at it, I’ll take a picture for you!”<br /> <br />“Ehehe, the dog is so cute. It’s licking Toudou.”<br /> <br />Tanaka approaches me. The distance is very close. It’s very embarrassing.<br /> <br />“Bow, bow-wow, bow-wow, bow-bow, bow-wow!”<br /> <br />It’s been barking at me this whole time. It seems like it’s trying to tell me something.<br /> <br />“Ta, Tanaka, help…”<br /> <br />“It’s okay. It doesn’t dislike you.”<br /> <br />No, the close distance between me and Tanaka is also an issue.<br /> <br />“Toudou, don’t move! Lend me your smartphone.”<br /> <br />I hand over my smartphone to Hime while holding the dog in one hand. Then, Hime takes multiple shots with the camera.<br /> <br />“Ehehe, the puppy is licking Toudou. It fell asleep being held by Toudou. Okay, I should get going now. You two enjoy your date! See you!”<br /> <br />This time, the girl went towards the back grooming area.<br /> <br />As I watched her back, I felt discomfort in my side.<br /> <br />Tanaka had puffed up her cheeks and was poking my side with her pointed lips.<br /> <br />“Toudou’s so popular. That girl was so cute. …Come to think of it, Michiba and Hana-chan are both cute too.”<br /> <br />“No, I didn’t realy pay attention. And I think Tanaka is the cutest.”<br /> <br />“Wha, Toudou, that’s embarrassing!”<br /> <br />Tanaka still had puffed up cheeks but had a happy expression. That was the right response.<br /> <br />“Ah, can I see the pictures from earlier?”<br /> <br />“O, okay.”<br /> <br />I show Tanaka the pictures on my phone.<br /> <br />“Yeah yeah, they came out really nice. Let’s take lots of pictures today, Toudou!”<br /> <br />“Very well…”<br /> <br />And so, our date began from the pet shop–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At the shop–<br /> <br />“Toudou, this stuffed animal is cute!”<br /> <br />“Um, is this cute? It looks like an alien but…”<br /> <br />“It’s cute! Ehehe, maybe I’ll get it as a souvenir for Hana-chan.”<br /> <br />“Then how about this. Hanazono likes hamsters.”<br /> <br />“Ah, that’s cute too.”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Even after moving to the candy store–<br /> <br />“Toudou likes sweets right? Did you like them since you were little?”<br /> <br />“When I was little I didn’t get to eat sweets much. The only thing I ate was candies.”<br /> <br />“I see, that’s why you like them now.”<br /> <br />“The cake I ate with Tanaka was especially delicious.”<br /> <br />“Wha, Toudou, that’s embarrassing!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Time passed quickly. I even forgot about going to the juice shop, our destination.<br /> <br />“So this is the famous game center I’ve heard about. You can take weird pictures with those machines?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, let’s go try it!”<br /> <br />“O, okay, if you say so…”<br /> <br />“Umm, like this… There. Toudou, do a peace sign!”<br /> <br />“Like this?”<br /> <br />“Ahaha, your face is all stiff.”<br /> <br />“Tanaka, too close, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />“It’s fine if it’s with Toudou.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Even at the plaza with a view of the bay–<br /> <br />“I’m glad the weather is nice! Toudou, let’s take a picture over there!”<br /> <br />“Tanaka, don’t rush or you’ll fall.”<br /> <br />“I’ll be fine– Kyaa!”<br /> <br />“Yes, just as I said. I… I’m sorry, I had to catch you.”<br /> <br />“U, yeah, thanks. I don’t mind.”<br /> <br />“…Do you, still need support?”<br /> <br />“Just a little longer like this is fine.”<br /> <br />“Hey, Tanaka…”<br /> <br />We took many pictures. It’s called a selfie. The me in the pictures had a smile. Tanaka was also smiling.<br /> <br />We both looked like we were having fun. The date I had with Hanazono the other day was fun too. But being on a date with Tanaka felt a little different. When I’m with Tanaka, my heart goes thump thump. Just what is this feeling?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My emotions can’t keep up. But I understand one thing – right now, I’m having fun.<br /> <br />Time seems to pass very quickly. I’ve heard about it but didn’t think I would get to experience it myself. I don’t want it to end. I was able to spend such time that makes me feel that way with Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At our original destination, the juice shop, we finally arrived at a karaoke place on the third floor of the shopping center.<br /> <br />But why karaoke?<br /> <br />“Huh? Hurry up and go in. Because I wanted to go karaoke with Toudou right?”<br /> <br />“Ah, yes but, that’s–“<br /> <br />“You wanted to go with everyone but couldn’t right? There might be some bad memories but, I’ll go with you!”<br /> <br />“Tanaka, got it. I’m going so stop pulling my sleeve.”<br /> <br />And so, I tried karaoke for the first time.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The karaoke box was a small private room.<br /> <br />Tanaka skillfully operated the machine. I observed the interior. Nothing seemed suspicious.<br /> <br />Not knowing what to do, I drank all the juice I brought from the drink bar.<br /> <br />“Wha!? Too fast! Anyway, I’ll go first so pick a song you want to sing with this!”<br /> <br />She put a tablet and tambourine on my lap. A tambourine… How do I use this? While I was confused, Tanaka grabbed the mic and started singing.<br /> <br />When the intro played, a song I knew that was popular on the streets came on. I think it’s sung by an idol called Hamster Girls. Tanaka’s body swayed to the intro. I mechanically hit the tambourine with an unchanging rhythm, a bit hesitantly.<br /> <br />When the intro ended and Tanaka started singing,<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The air in the room changed–<br /> <br />I got goosebumps on my back. In that instant, Tanaka had taken over this space. It was only a moment. I forgot about hitting the tambourine. Tanaka’s singing voice resonated directly in my head.<br /> <br />I’ve heard singing on TV before. I understood it theoretically. I’ve also experienced chorus contests.<br /> <br />My goosebumps won’t go away. I’ve only gotten goosebumps like this when I’ve felt my life was in danger–<br /> <br />Tanaka’s voice pierces my body. Calling it moving feels inadequate.<br /> <br />I wasn’t interested in music before. I didn’t understand why singing was popular all over the world. The answer was here.<br /> <br />When Tanaka finished the song, I was naturally applauding.<br /> <br />It was my first time experiencing this. Tanaka seemed like a different person when she was singing.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Phew–, first time since I went with my brother… Toudou, you okay!?”<br /> <br />I couldn’t stop applauding. For some reason, sweat was coming out of my face. Why? I only listened to singing. There’s only one thing I can say.<br /> <br />“…I’m glad I came to karaoke with Tanaka.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, I’m glad I brought you! I’ll keep you company anytime! Ah, Toudou, let’s sing this song together!”<br /> <br />Tanaka passes me the mic. I haven’t picked a song yet…<br /> <br />Of course I can’t sing my chorus contest songs here. If I did that, Hanazono would scold me later. I have to sing a more trendy song.<br /> <br />“–Tanaka, sorry but… can I sing the song Tanaka sang?”<br /> <br />“Huh? I don’t mind at all! Then press here!”<br /> <br />–I remember the lyrics and melody. Plus I had the best example.<br /> <br />When the song started playing, I gripped the mic tightly and started singing–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Amazing!! So good!!”<br /> <br />I sang desperately.<br /> <br />Since it was a girl’s song, there were some parts where the pitch was off, but I think I sang it almost perfectly.<br /> <br />But, I find it strange. My singing had a completely different quality from Tanaka’s.<br /> <br />There may also be technical issues I’m not aware of.<br /> <br />I asked Tanaka about it.<br /> <br />“Ah, that’s, you know! It’s a little embarrassing but, isn’t it about liking the song or not? Singing with feeling, you know, ahh it’s difficult!”<br /> <br />“No, I understand. I sang desperately. Rather than singing, it was more like imitating Tanaka. So that’s why… I see, it’s a deep world. It’s very interesting. Also, singing together with a friend is very fun.”<br /> <br />After finishing singing, my body was wrapped in a sense of accomplishment. It’s a strange feeling.<br /> <br />Tanaka looked at me with a happy face.<br /> <br />“Hehe, I’m glad I brought you! I’ll keep you company anytime! Ah, Toudou, let’s sing this song together!”<br /> <br />I sing together with Tanaka. Is this what everyday life is like for high schoolers?<br /> <br />Can everyone sing this well? No, Tanaka is special. I was able to have the valuable experience of being moved by art for the first time.</p>



<h3>Chapter 20: Everything Accelerates</h3>



<p> <br />Around thirty minutes had passed. I drank too much juice. After telling Tanaka, I head to the bathroom. The interior of the karaoke box was filled with young people. They must all be enjoying singing.<br /> <br />I didn’t realize there was such entertainment. Of course I knew it intellectually.<br /> <br />Come to think of it, why didn’t I go to karaoke with Hanazono who I was together with for four years? I knew she listened to trendy songs. I was never invited. If I invite her to go with the three of us next time, I wonder if she would come. …It’ll definitely be fine.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />When I came out of the bathroom, my heart jumped. At the same time, my head sobered up. I could tell even from far away. The atmosphere in the room with me and Tanaka had changed.<br /> <br />“Are you alright, sir? Did you drink too much? Um… scary…”<br /> <br />The clerk called out worriedly to me just standing still motionless.<br /> <br />“It’s fine…”<br /> <br />“Ah, ye, yeah? Huh, why am I sitting…? Crap… my legs gave out…”<br /> <br />I consciously suppressed my heart rate and hurried back to the room.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On the other side of the door, there were three presences. Tanaka and two others. Not robbers. Not thieves. I don’t sense any violence yet. I concentrated all my nerves and quietly opened the door.<br /> <br />Inside were two men talking to Tanaka. Tanaka had a displeased expression.<br /> <br />I only recognized one person. The college student from my part-time job, Murakami. I don’t know the other man. Murakami notices me.<br /> <br />“Oh, so you’re with Toudou after all! Who knew we’d be at the same karaoke! Man, Toudou turns me down when I invite him to hang out~.”<br /> <br />“Um… I’m out with Toudou today so please leave.”<br /> <br />“Geez Tanaka you’re cold~. But that’s what I like about you. Let’s join up!”<br /> <br />Tanaka’s eyes met mine and she smiled at me.<br /> <br />“Ah, Toudou, come here. Some annoying people are bothering me.”<br /> <br />I approach Tanaka. Tanaka stands up and takes my hand. I can feel her body trembling.<br /> <br />Murakami and the unknown man also stand up, blocking the door. It seems they don’t intend to let Tanaka escape.<br /> <br />“Hey, Haru, do me a favor as your ex. Drink with Murakami senpai and me. I’ll keep you company too. And really, I didn’t think you’d dump me after three days. Why did you dump me?”<br /> <br />The frivolous-looking man looked at me.<br /> <br />“Ah, you must be the new pet. Haru would get a new boyfriend but break up right away in middle school. You’ll be dumped soon too. Because Haru is cute so she gets boyfriends easily.”<br /> <br />“Don’t lie! Stop it, it has nothing to do with Toudou!!”<br /> <br />“Hah? Toudou just has to leave. Hey, if you don’t get out I’ll punch you? This isn’t my part-time job so the manager isn’t here. I do mixed martial arts you know?”<br /> <br />I felt like my capacity to process information was about to be exceeded. At the same time, the calm part of my mind didn’t miss the men’s movements.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka was a wonderful woman. Anyone would be lucky to date her. It wouldn’t be strange if she had an ex-boyfriend.<br /> <br />I understood that, but for some reason I couldn’t stop the pain in my chest, the bitterness, and the nausea.<br /> <br />I was frustrated with myself for not knowing the Tanaka of the past. I was ashamed that our date was ruined while I went to the bathroom. I was pathetic for not being able to talk back. Love was difficult for me since I had no experience.<br /> <br />Was I just being made fun of when going on dates with Tanaka?<br /> <br />Would I be laughed at later? To Tanaka, was I just a convenient man?<br /> <br />Will Tanaka dump me? Just thinking about that–my chest hurt sharply.<br /> <br />Resetting would make it better–<br /> <br />logically that was not wrong.<br /> <br />Killing my feelings cultivated with Tanaka would make the suffering go away there.<br /> <br />But that was wrong. I was not the me from before. I couldn’t move forward like that.<br /> <br />Plus, Tanaka was not that kind of girl.<br /> <br />I spoke to Tanaka while suppressing the pain in my chest, the anguish, and the surging jealousy in my heart.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Tanaka, it’s alright. I believe your words–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That was all I could manage to say.<br /> <br />Tanaka tightly gripped my hand. Murakami started shadowboxing in front of me.<br /> <br />The frivolous man had a relaxed smile.<br /> <br />“Haru. If you don’t want him getting hurt, don’t be with him. Murakami doesn’t get jokes.”<br /> <br />“Haha, I’m better at fights than matches!”<br /> <br />“Fu, don’t mess around! And if you do anything to Toudou I definitely won’t forgive you!”<br /> <br />“Can’t be helped. Murakami, teach him to fear adults.”<br /> <br />“Oh, I’ll play with him.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Murakami lowered his hips and charged at me to grab me.<br /> <br />Everything seemed to move in slow motion. Only Tanaka’s sad face was seared into my mind. I gently let go of Tanaka’s hand.<br /> <br />This was the second time I’ve felt an incomprehensible emotion.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I see, if I don’t reset, my emotions explode–<br /> <br />Even so, Tanaka’s scent nearby kept my rationality intact.<br /> <br />I didn’t want to make loud noises. I know girls don’t like that. This wasn’t my first time in this kind of situation. At Hanazono I was confused and didn’t know how hard to go. Murakami’s movements were slow. In exchange, his weight was probably considerable.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />I gently gripped Murakami’s fist so as not to crush it.<br /> <br />“O-Oi, let, let go of my hand–“<br /> <br />Murakami’s fist was as soft as a child’s. What exactly was this college student? He must threaten people in ways other than violence. Many of the university students I’ve met are more intelligent.<br /> <br />Murakami couldn’t move. It would be simple to crush his fist. But violence was no good.<br /> <br />“I-It hurts!”<br /> <br />When Murakami tried to move I strengthened my grip just a little. I removed one hand and firmly flicked next to Murakami’s ear. The sound pressure created a shock.<br /> <br />“Uwah…”<br /> <br />Murakami limply collapsed to the floor. His eyes couldn’t focus. I adjusted his consciousness to barely still be there.<br /> <br />The frivolous man looked at me bewildered.<br /> <br />“Wha, no way right? That’s, that’s impossible…”<br /> <br />“I’m very angry right now. Can you quietly go home?”<br /> <br />“Sh-Shut up! Acting all high and mighty even though you’re younger–“<br /> <br />I wonder if age matters at a time like this. I picked up Murakami’s smartphone that had fallen to the floor.<br /> <br />And then, I firmly gripped the smartphone and crushed it.<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />The frivolous man looked between me and the smartphone over and over.<br /> <br />When something unexpected happens, humans become confused.<br /> <br />I exuded a level of intimidation that even normal people could feel.<br /> <br />He must have felt the air grow even heavier. Stiffness of the body, shaking legs, amount of sweat, shallowness of breath – I could tell the state of my target from those. If I psychologically cornered him here and destroyed his spirit, anxiety would disappear.<br /> <br />If I let him go while still conflicted, there was a risk of being attacked. Luckily this was an enclosed room. I’d instill fear before releasing him. There’s no need to feel sorry for them.<br /> <br />“I won’t let it stand. Get out of here, yo, you freak.”<br /> <br />“Haa…haa…”<br /> <br />Fear stiffened his body. That’s right, this was a different fear than what I felt at Michiba. Just being in this space made it feel impossible to live.<br /> <br />I didn’t take my eyes off of the two of them. I consciously lifted the corners of my mouth.<br /> <br />To you two it probably looks like I’m smiling. Can you feel the abnormality from that?<br /> <br />That’s right, you two from here on will–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Eek, eek! Seriously so persistent! Don’t even show your face. Your gaze is gross! Eek, eek! Anyway who the heck are you? I don’t even know your name, I don’t remember you at all! Why are you randomly acting like you’re my ex? Everyone’s always like that, acting like we’re dating when we haven’t even talked or anything! I don’t get it at all! If you’re going to bully Toudou I’ll be your opponent!”<br /> <br />Tanaka, who should have been behind me, came forward swinging her bag. It was a rather adorable attack.<br /> <br />Surprised by the sudden event, I came to my senses.<br /> <br />She lightly knocked on Murakami and the frivolous guy’s heads with my fist. The metal fittings probably made it painful.<br /> <br />“There, there~~, okay Toudou, pull yourself together and come out!”<br /> <br />Tanaka smiled only at me.<br /> <br />I couldn’t move my own face well. I wonder what kind of expression I should make at a time like this? Hanazono, I don’t understand… our date is ruined…<br /> <br />“Tanaka, let’s go.”<br /> <br />Instead, I took Tanaka’s hand and headed towards the checkout.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Even after leaving the karaoke bar, I was still holding Tanaka’s hand.<br /> <br />I should be feeling gentle, feeling happy, so why did I also feel anguished?<br /> <br />Even so, the hand I was holding–encouraged my heart that felt like crying.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />I started walking faster. I repeated the same words in my head.<br /> <br />–Believe in Tanaka. Believe in Tanaka.<br /> <br />“Um, Toudou, wait–“<br /> <br />At some point, Tanaka had started jogging while being pulled along by me.<br /> <br />“S-Sorry.”<br /> <br />I stopped walking. I let go of the hand I was holding. I felt like I had let go of something important.<br /> <br />“Hey, let’s walk slowly? We still have time right?”<br /> <br />“Oh, right.”<br /> <br />“Toudou… You ended up hating me after all huh. Asking weird stuff and all.”<br /> <br />“There’s no way that could happen.”<br /> <br />I just couldn’t get any words out. I didn’t know what kind of face to talk to Tanaka with.<br /> <br />Unknown emotions assaulted me.<br /> <br />Before I could open my mouth, Tanaka said in a tone resembling resignation.<br /> <br />“As I thought, Hanazono suits Toudou huh.”<br /> <br />“Why did Hanazono’s name come up? Tanaka, I–“<br /> <br />“No, someone as pure and wonderful as Toudou is too good for me.”<br /> <br />An unpleasant feeling simmered in my chest area.<br /> <br />Saying that, Tanaka took a step away from me. I felt an invisible wall. What was this?<br /> <br />“Hey, wait a minute. I want you to listen before you go home.”<br /> <br />Tanaka pointed to the rest area sofa across from the cafe. There were places to sit set up in various spots in the shopping center. You often see families and couples sitting there.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />We sat on the sofa.<br /> <br />Silence flowed.<br /> <br />Normally the silence when I was with Tanaka wasn’t awkward. But this silence made me feel uneasy. What was making me uneasy? What did I want to ask? What did I dislike?<br /> <br />The distance felt farther than normal. Just a difference of a few centimeters but it felt very far.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That further disturbed my heart. Tanaka started talking in a tone that sounded like resignation.<br /> <br />“I’ve had trouble socializing since long ago. I didn’t understand personal distance. It was fine when I was a kid. But, you know, when I became a teenager, when I hit puberty, you know, I seemed to have given you the wrong idea. …… “<br /> <br />“You mean, romantic misunderstandings, right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tanaka was gazing into the distance. Walking hand-in-hand over there was a small boy and girl. It was a very gentle look.<br /> <br />“In middle school I think, I walked to school with a neighborhood boy. Then suddenly a rumor spread that we were dating–, even when I denied it the boy didn’t deny it, so I had to expressly say I didn’t like him… I didn’t get it at all? Even though he hadn’t confessed to me or anything [I thought we might be dating based on the atmosphere] and stuff like that.”<br /> <br />I was surprised that such an Chapter existed. Tanaka continued as I stayed silent.<br /> <br />“The guy from the karaoke earlier was like that too. He was a friendly upperclassman but he suddenly started calling me his girl… I got pissed so I went to his classroom in the upper grades and violently rejected him… A lot of stuff like that happened.”<br /> <br />Tanaka let out a sigh.<br /> <br />“Unbelievable right? Even though I look easygoing and people say I seem like I play around…”<br /> <br />“That’s not true. I [believe Tanaka].”<br /> <br />“Yeah, thank y–“<br /> <br />That’s right, if we talk we can understand. I felt my heart settle down more than before.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Is that why Tanaka doesn’t make friends?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, human relationships are troublesome. At work I only chat with Toudou and the chef right? Oh, I’m nice to my little brother though? He really likes me so he’s always driving me around, protecting me, stuff like that. He’s a good kid.”<br /> <br />“Why were you able to become friends with me? Is it because I’m abnormal?”<br /> <br />“Um… at first Toudou, I didn’t really understand what you were thinking, and you did actions outside common sense…it was really annoying. But as I interacted with you bit by bit I realized. Toudou’s heart is really beautiful. I’d never met anyone like that before.”<br /> <br />–My heart is beautiful? I’m a dirty human. I can’t do anything. I don’t have the power to save anyone.<br /> <br />“I’m not that kind of beautiful person.”<br /> <br />“Ahaha, you can’t evaluate yourself! It’s what I felt after watching Toudou all this past year.”<br /> <br />Saying that, Tanaka let out a sigh.<br /> <br />“To be honest, I was really jealous of Hanazono the whole time. I mean, Hanazono did stuff like eat together with Toudou, go shopping together, all kinds of stuff. I looked forward to hearing about it at work but it gradually became painful. Even so I thought, I want her to reconcile with Toudou soon~~! And then…”<br /> <br />“My reset–“<br /> <br />“Yeah, I don’t really get the reset, but seeing Toudou talking with Hanazono, I thought I wanted them to make up. So I cheered you on.”<br /> <br />That time huh.<br /> <br />Certainly, without Tanaka’s push I might have never spoken to Hanazono again.<br /> <br />Without interacting with Tanaka I would have coldly cut myself off from Michiba and Sasami too. That would be–sad.<br /> <br />Tanaka reached out her hand and stood up.<br /> <br />Just a few seconds probably. Tanaka closed her eyes and slowly opened them.<br /> <br />Tanaka’s opened eyes felt like they had a very strong will and determination. It was as if her eyes were blazing.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Umm! I got a ton of energy today so I’ll be fine! Oh, I might have misunderstood Toudou’s feelings. Ahaha, I really am stupid huh. Even though you don’t feel that way at all. Toudou is suited for Hanazono so, um, I’m going home now.”<br /> <br />Why did Tanaka turn her face away from me? Turn her back to me?<br /> <br />“Tanaka?”<br /> <br />“Toudou…if you do have feelings for me, absolutely don’t misunderstand. I, don’t feel anything for Toudou–at all–“<br /> <br />Why was Tanaka’s voice shaking? Why was Tanaka’s body temperature rising? What should I say?<br /> <br />Just earlier I felt I could understand the karaoke incident after hearing Tanaka’s story. I was planning to walk home together, talk about what happened today, and confess my feelings to Tanaka. But was it all just my misunderstanding…<br /> <br />My heart hurts. It’s painful. I hate this pain–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Bye bye, don’t ask me out on dates anymore… Since we’re just friends. Cherish Hana-chan.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Her words cut into my heart even more. It was very painful, hurt, sad, and lonely–<br /> <br />I could only watch Tanaka’s back as she ran away.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Scenes of my memories with Tanaka played through my head.<br /> <br />Tanaka when we first met. Our workplace where we spent time together. Her expression when she said she wanted to be friends.<br /> <br />I made some kind of mistake. But I don’t know what that mistake is. Tanaka had already gone home.<br /> <br />Why did she go home? Things were going well until the karaoke. Why did Tanaka suddenly start disliking me?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Changing perspectives–<br /> <br />How do I feel about Tanaka?<br /> <br />“Tanaka is kind, adorable, and even though I don’t know the presence of blood relatives, if I had a mother, she would probably be someone like Tanaka. Thinking about Tanaka made me happy. The thought of seeing Tanaka at work made me happy. Having a meal with Tanaka at school made me happy.”<br /> <br />With just our hands touching, just smelling her scent, my heart rate becomes abnormal.<br /> <br />My chest hurts. My chest hurts. My chest hurts so much. Resetting would make it feel better. Erasing my feelings for Tanaka would make the pain disappear.<br /> <br />Tanaka must have come to dislike me.<br /> <br />Were my feelings for Tanaka fake? It’s different from the manipulated affection in elementary school. These feelings aren’t fake at all. They were cultivated over time. But it’s painful, so. I looked up at the ceiling. I put my hand to my chest. And, I’ll reset–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Suddenly, an impact came to my back. It was my first time being grabbed from behind so I was shaken. I turned around to look behind the sofa and Hime was there. The puppy was on my back.<br /> <br />“Hey, Toudou what are you spacing out for! Hurry up and go after her!”<br /> <br />“Arf arf, arf arf!!”<br /> <br />I was surprised by Hime’s sharp words. The puppy at my ear was also scolding me.<br /> <br />“Why should I go after her?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Wasn’t that girl crying?<br /> <br />“But, even if you say go after her I don’t know what to say to Tanaka right now.”<br /> <br />“Haa~~~, I don’t know what your relationship is but just convey your honest feelings!”<br /> <br />“My…feelings.”<br /> <br />“Arf!”<br /> <br />“That’s right! Anyway, that girl, she’s fast! You won’t catch up at this rate–“<br /> </p>



<p> </p>







<p><br />My feelings. My high speed thinking activated. To me, Tanaka is?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />She is a precious friend and…She’s my favorite girl.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I felt an urge to shout. This was the first time I’ve felt this way–<br /> <br />My feet started moving on their own.<br /> <br />I needed to catch up with Tanaka as fast as possible. If I didn’t convey my feelings I would regret it.<br /> <br />I had to get to Tanaka’s side even one second faster–<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Wai–“<br />“Arf–“<br /> <br />Hime and the puppy’s voices cut off. I’ll thank them for pushing my back later.<br /> <br />The shopping center was open passageway style with interior hallways. Tanaka had already passed through the exit of the shopping center. The search for the shortest route was complete.<br /> <br />I conveyed the maximum power to the floor from my feet. The most important thing to me right now was catching up to Tanaka. I ran as if jumping from the third floor escalator in front of me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–No obstacles, footing secured, landed on second floor, absorbed impact.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />How stupid can I be. Only thinking about myself, not understanding Tanaka’s feelings at all. Recall Tanaka’s face then. She had a pained, hurt expression.<br /> <br />I don’t want to make Tanaka have that kind of face.<br /> <br />It’s because I love Tanaka with all my heart.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Accelerate, jump over open passageway railing, absorb impact, successful five point landing, arrived on first floor.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Resets are no good. Thinking alone is no good. Because Tanaka is my precious friend. Don’t run away from the problem in front of you. If I can’t catch up to Tanaka here, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–Crowd near the entrance, reroute reconstruction, spatial recognition, overall prediction.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At some point I had stopped genuinely living. That’s why things don’t go well with Hanazono, Tanaka, Michiba, or Sasami.<br /> <br />Tanaka’s figure was already no longer near the shopping center entrance. Once she’s out on the streets it will be difficult to find her. But I won’t give up.<br /> <br />I slipped through the crowd near the entrance<br /> </p>



<p> <br />— “Filming a movie?” “A stuntman maybe?” “Is the camera rolling?” “Someone fell!” “Papa, someone’s flying!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />People’s voices faded away with the scenery.<br /> <br />My gaze caught sight of Tanaka’s back as she walked in the distance. My heart leaps up. I, who has never felt fear before, feel like I’m shaking. I’m scared of interacting with people. I’m scared of Tanaka disliking me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[But you’ll be fine now]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Hanazono’s words floated up. Courage welled up inside me. My heart’s voice started speaking on its own.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Tanakaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! I love you so much Tanaka!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka, who was halfway across the intersection, looks back. Tanaka’s figure grows closer and closer. Just a little more distance.<br /> <br />I can tell with my eyesight. Her eyes were wet with tears. Her mouth was moving. I read her lips. [You can’t come here. I don’t want you to see me cry.]<br /> <br />I hesitate for just a moment. What should I say when I catch up?<br /> <br />I punch myself in the face<br /> <br />— No more hemming and hawing. I just need to convey my feelings. The past doesn’t matter. My past is a terrible thing anyway. I’m going to build a future with Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At that moment, I felt a sensation like my whole body was bristling. My spatial recognition sounded an alert. My high-speed thinking formulated a prediction. My mind dispassionately stated just the facts.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The traffic light was blinking. The truck not slowing down in my peripheral vision. The half-asleep driver. The probability of an accident happening to Tanaka is 99.9%.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That’s no good. Please. Stop.<br /> <br />Tanaka is precious to me. Don’t take her away. [ having precious things taken away from me] is what I hate.<br /> <br />I restructure the calculations. With my current physical abilities there’s no way I can definitely catch up.<br /> <br />Tanaka will be hit by the truck in a matter of seconds.<br /> <br />Tanaka will get hurt. Tanaka will disappear. Tanaka will —<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My mind felt like it was short-circuiting. No matter how many times I calculate, there’s no way to make it in time. My reason tells me to give up.<br /> <br />But my remaining 0.1% instinct said otherwise.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Reset]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Erasing my emotions isn’t the only reset.<br /> <br />If I go beyond my limits in exchange for [something] in my mind, that’s fine.<br /> <br />If Tanaka is saved then whatever happens to me is fine. Even if my body and heart break, that’s fine.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Without any more hesitation, I reset [something]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />— I feel a sensation like my brain is exploding. I feel an abnormality in the flow of my blood. Blood is flowing from my eyes and nose. My body temperature is rising sharply. A burning smell spreads through my mouth.<br /> <br />The scenery around me fades away completely. The muscles I’ve trained tear apart. Even blocking the pain, the extraordinary agony is carved into my soul.<br /> <br />But still, I reach out my hand. Beyond my own limits<br /> </p>



<p> <br />— for the sake of the person I love most.</p>



<h3>Chapter 21: Prologue to the Beginning</h3>



<p> <br />In the park on a bench.<br /> <br />Sitting with a girl I don’t know. She was a very expressive and cute girl.<br /> <br />I understand that I love this girl and must not make her sad.<br /> <br />“You surprised me, Todo. You suddenly came running at full speed through the intersection?”<br /> <br />“Ah, sorry for startling you.”<br /> <br />“No, I was a little happy, heh heh.”<br /> <br />I had secretly checked my phone earlier and asked Hanazono this girl’s name. [Tanaka Haru] – the girl I’m on a date with today. After that, notifications from Hanazono didn’t stop coming in, but I decided to ignore them.<br /> <br />Getting through this situation takes priority.<br /> <br />It’s okay. I still have the feeling that I [love] this girl. I don’t know what happened to me, but it must have been a failed reset. Something sad must have happened.<br /> <br />Luckily, my phone had a report summarizing the details of today’s date. Looking at that I can judge the general situation.<br /> <br />Even though I’ve lost my memories of Tanaka, my feelings remain. It should be fixable to an extent.<br /> <br />Tanaka looks happy but also lonely. I don’t know why, but it’s not a problem. I just need to avoid making her sad.<br /> <br />For some reason, my body is tattered. There are few external injuries but my insides are in terrible shape. I need to go to the hospital immediately. I try to move my legs but they won’t move.<br /> <br />“I see.”<br /> <br />“Hmm, you’re getting kinda cold, aren’t you!”<br /> <br />“No, it’s nothing. Just a little tired.”<br /> <br />I can’t let this girl notice.<br /> <br />“Oh, yeah, I guess a lot happened huh. Ah, in my case, ever since I met you my life has been super chaotic!”<br /> <br />Tanaka starts talking about our meeting. We met at her part-time job, worked together, I would always walk her home after work, drinking juice together from the vending machine was something to look forward to.<br /> <br />But I don’t have those memories. More than feeling sad, I’m straining just to grasp the current situation.<br /> <br />Plus, I don’t want to make Tanaka sad. I understand that much even without the memories.<br /> <br />“And then, just now, when you told me you loved me, I was super happy! But it’s still no good…”<br /> <br />That’s right, I love this girl. I don’t know why I came to love her. I was able to convey that I love her.<br /> <br />It feels like my past self is like a different person. My past self tried hard.<br /> <br />“Toudou… really liked Hanachan, right? So… try again… and face her properly…”<br /> <br />“Hanazono is an important friend. I’m facing her properly.”<br /> <br />“No, that’s not it.”<br /> <br />Tanaka shakes her head. Her face illuminated by the setting sun was very beautiful. I shouldn’t be in a relationship with anyone in my abnormal state. Maybe it was good that I reset with Hanazono after all. I should probably hide my feelings for this girl too.<br /> <br />But my chest tightens painfully, for some reason, my heart beats faster.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Toudou… it’s hard, isn’t it? Toudou is the first for me. I never had so much fun with someone before. But when we’re together the guilt is awful… I hate that I feel relieved seeing you unable to date Hanachan.”<br /> <br />“Tanaka–“<br /> <br />My current goal is to not make this girl sad.<br /> <br />“Hehe, even if you reset, you can try again. You should be with Hanachan, not a girl like me–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />For an instant, a memory of this girl almost surfaces in my mind. I’m shocked by this fact. I’ve never had lost memories come back before.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“So… give all your love to Hanachan! To you, I’m like a mother figure, right? Hehe, I can tell just by looking at you. So…”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Still, I love you.”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />What is the feeling of love? The words came out on their own. I used to think it only brought me pain and sadness. But at the same time, it can also bring warmth.<br /> <br />She gave me a gentle smile. Ah, this must be what a mother feels like…<br /> <br />It was a kindness that enveloped me.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“That’s unfair. If you say that… But, you know, I’m the one who’s unfair. I took advantage of the pure Todou and monopolized him. That’s why I can’t respond to Todou’s feelings.”<br /> <br />Tanaka doesn’t realize that I’ve lost my memory.<br /> <br />Maybe this is for the best. I have no right to fall in love with someone. But it hurts my chest. Unknown memories have been flowing through my head since earlier. My head feels like it’s going crazy.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Todou, it’s okay. We’ll always be friends! Let’s continue to have fun… hng… together!”<br /> <br />“Is that so…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, because, you know, it’s unfair. Hanachan might have been able to date Todou. And, Todou, you might get closer to more people in the future… Oh, maybe you’ll find someone you like as much as Hanachan. But personally, I want you to be with Hanachan… Todou’s world is much broader, you know!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I understood.<br /> <br />This girl is too kind. She’s prioritizing Hanazono over her own feelings. My affection for her is making her sad. In that case, I can only take action.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“If I lose my feelings for Tanaka, and Tanaka’s guilt disappears—”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A single tear runs down Tanaka’s cheek.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I’m going to reset it again.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka smiles. This girl I just met today. The girl I have enough affection for that lost memories almost come back. The only connection between this girl and me is the feeling [I love her].<br /> <br />I won’t forget her face. Carve it into my soul. Fierce pain rages deep in my chest. For a normal person, just this much pain would be fatal.<br /> <br />“–Toudou… I…”<br /> <br />I close my eyes and switch my mindset. Unfamiliar memories race through my mind like a flip book.<br /> <br />But still — if resetting will erase Tanaka’s suffering —<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Tanaka. From here on is my true start.<br /> <br />Watch me. Wait for me.<br /> <br />Tanaka and I will — this time, I’ll live a normal youth —<br /> <br />I reset my affection for Tanaka.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Toudou, hey, are you okay…?”<br /> <br />Opening my eyes, Tanaka was there, looking worried and touching my shoulder. My heart rate doesn’t accelerate. I don’t feel anything.<br /> <br />The affection, the love I had for Tanaka is all gone, completely disappeared. The pain in my heart is gone, disappeared. She’s become a girl I don’t know at all.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I don’t feel anything for Tanaka, who I had found so precious just before.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“–I’m fine.”<br /> <br />“Oh… back to the first time we met… hehe, I’m stupid… but now you and Hanachan can–“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I interrupt Tanaka’s words.<br /> <br />“It’s true my affection for you is gone. But… I can’t erase the memories I’ve carved into my soul–“<br /> <br />All the memories should be gone. Even the only connection of having loved her is gone.<br /> <br />But somehow, unfamiliar memories float up in my mind. It’s because I carved them into my soul.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I understand now. I’ve reset and experienced many things over and over. I understand people’s hearts a little better.<br /> <br />Then no matter how many times, I just have to connect with people. It’s fine to make mistakes any number of times.<br /> <br />It’s old news that I’m not normal. I just have to grow —<br /> </p>



<p> <br />–All I have to do is come to love Tanaka again.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“So, Tanaka — this time, [trust me] –“<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Sweat won’t stop pouring down my face. Nothing resonates in my heart. I voice unfounded hopes. The past me would never have said such words.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Why don’t we start our youth from a reset? “<br /> </p>



<p>Hearing my words, the girl named Tanaka — for some reason — burst into tears.<br /> </p>
