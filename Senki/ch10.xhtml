<h1>Chapter 10: Contests Of Strength Don't End Well</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—I’ll crush you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san clasped her hands together and muttered to herself. Branches of trees near her mimicked her motion, tightening their grip on demons in their grasp until the bodies snapped with a sickening series of crunches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This should be the last of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so, too. I don’t sense anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring the corpses littering the forest floor, we searched for any further movement in the meadow. I had </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Short-Range Elementary Magic—Night Vision</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> activated, allowing me to see in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, several hours after entering the forest, it seemed as if we had completed our extermination of the monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We patrolled in a circle around the capital, but so far we had met only common demons. Having cleared them out, I was looking forward to an easy morning the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, most of my time was spent watching Arina-san slaughter the demons with her earth magic. I almost felt sorry for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were currently near the main gate leading into the capital. Thankfully, we weren’t quite close enough for any of our attacks to accidentally hit the city. If we destroyed the city walls, I didn’t know how much responsibility I’d have to take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I didn’t do much, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be like that, you helped a lot. And we got a lot of magic stones, so Milena-san will be happy with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She held up a leather pouch full of magical stones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to be able to return home, but Arina-san didn’t seem to feel the same way. She faced the south side of the forest, deep in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you think it’s strange, Raize? Why so many of them have been appearing recently?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so? They’re not like normal animals, but even then, it’s hard to believe that every monster suddenly decided to appear in the last few days. And I doubt it’s a simple rise in breeding rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what do you think? It has to be something unnatural.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a logical conclusion. An unnatural effect should have an unnatural cause. I didn’t know what exactly that cause was, but I was certain that a third party was involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had encountered about ten times as many monsters as normal. Although subjugating them was easy enough, we needed a more long-term solution. There were major roads leading through the forest that travellers and merchants often used. Leaving the monsters unchecked could affect trading routes. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This really is a job for the Knights.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It could be someone’s magic, or maybe a drug of some sort.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…There’s no point thinking about it here. Let’s return to the palace first. We can discuss it there, with Milena-san, while we sort the stones. I’m not too sure, but I think we picked up some pretty good ones.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raize!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She interrupted me with a warning, and we jumped away from where we had been standing. A huge figure appeared there immediately after, cracking the ground with the force of its landing. I sensed powerful magic. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Something’s wrong.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How far are we from the capital?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, not very. Look, it’s right behind us, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But—if this is the royal capital, then why? It’s supposed to only be found in the western part of the continent—the chimera.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san’s eyes were locked in front of us. A beast sat there, staring at us vigilantly—no, that wasn’t quite right. It growled happily, like it was excited to have found prey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three heads, a goat on each side and a lion in the center, sat on its gigantic body. Two great wings protruded from the shiny fur covering its back. Just the tail, a fanged venomous snake, was five times longer than I was tall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chimera was magnitudes stronger than the monsters I had encountered thus far. The books I’d read didn’t do it justice. Most magicians would be paralyzed by the pressure. Not many could stand in front of it unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The intimidating aura threatened to envelop me—but I refused to give in. If anything, I was excited for the upcoming confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow… I want to crush it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san was talking to herself, breathless. Like me, she showed no outward sign of nervousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps angered by our unwavering attitudes, the chimera let out a deafening scream from its three heads. The surrounding brush shook from the sheer force of the vibrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we stood firm. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we’re court magicians.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to take my time with it, but I’m tired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, let’s do this quickly. I’ll leave the corpse in front of the main gate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can figure it out tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a snap of Arina-san’s fingers, the chimera’s feet left the ground, and the beast was thrown high into the sky. I watched it soar through the air—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, hey, that might actually hit the gate. We’re going to be in a lot of trouble if you wreck it, you know? If you wanted to throw it around, you should have gone in the other direction…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t it have been better to wait for it to do something? It came out of nowhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care. I was going to kill it either way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chimerae are extremely difficult to subdue. Regardless of how it came to be here, we couldn’t just leave it alone. I drew my rapier. The blade glowed blue under the moonlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you going to kill it? Should I not do too much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your choice, just make it easy for me. If its body is anything to judge by, its magic stone will be pretty big.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… I’d like to defeat it as cleanly as possible, so I’ll try not to destroy the body. But my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thunder Needle</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> isn’t powerful enough…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thunder Needle of Death</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is magic that pierces through the magical stones of small demons with pinpoint accuracy. It isn’t meant to be used on a creature as large as the chimera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I needed a different spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The distance is about… six hundred meters. Not too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I channeled mana into my rapier, and a formula appeared on the blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, it was dressed in a crackling sleeve of blue lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Thunder</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A streak of lightning ascended into the sky and disappeared into the dark, cloudless night. Moments later, roaring claps of thunder echoed through the atmosphere and the sky was illuminated by flashes of lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A single bolt fell vertically and pierced the chimera’s body. The impact bent the lion’s head in a grotesque, yet strangely artful, manner.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Attribute Long-Distance Advanced Magic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Thunder.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This powerful spell compresses electricity in the sky before releasing it all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlike a lot of other lightning magic, this spell doesn’t kill with shock damage alone. The physical impact of the lightning finishes its target off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never seen it before. Is it possession magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, it’s universal. But as far as I know, only my master and I are aware of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together, we walked toward the chimera’s body lying on the ground. It was getting late, and a cool night breeze began to blow.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Come to think of it, winter wasn’t too long ago…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about the weather, we arrived where the chimera was thrust headfirst into the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I did a pretty good job. It’s only slightly burnt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s collect our reward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After recovering a magic stone about the size of a human head, the surrounding flesh liquefied and was absorbed into the ground. Within a few seconds, the chimera’s body was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you collecting the rest tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They might be taken to the Knights, but—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arina-san snapped her fingers, and the bodies of every demon she had hunted today appeared in a pile by the gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t bring them inside the capital, so I’ll keep them here for now. We took some of them, including the chimera’s, already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are they not going to decompose?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll put some preservation magic on it, so it should be fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, shall we go home? It’s late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’m pretty tired. I’m looking forward to brewing some tea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds great—hey, please wait!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving me with the pouch of stones, Arina-san hurried home. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait a minute. The chimera’s stone is way too big for this bag… and she’s getting farther by the second! Why is everyone in our department like this?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, it seemed like I was going to be returning by myself, so I decided to carry the chimera’s stone in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its weight was my only companion as I walked home.</span></p>
