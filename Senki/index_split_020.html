<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_22">Chapter 61: Magic Exergy Course – Part one</h1>

	<p class="block_2">The inn feels more colorful with more ladies around.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The men from the village are now taking the initiative to help us keep watch, probably as a way to thank us. It looks like they’re having trouble with it, but they’re full of motivation.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It could just be my imagination, but the men from the omnibus also seem to be working pretty quickly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We’re not looters, but we have to go around the houses looking for resources we need. Of course, we’ve been checking if there aren’t any orcs or other monsters around, and working only during the allotted time. We don’t know how long this situation is going to go on for.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Eh… Then I want to hold a study meeting about magic energy.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m in the room allocated to Bloody Rose and Hikari.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We’re here because I gave in to Yor’s aggressive approach. I hear she likes magic so much, that she even joined an academy in the Magic State of Efa.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Trisha says there were heated arguments between her and her family when she decided to go to the academy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">By the way, Leila and the others are students of the Magius academy, and they’re here because Trisha wants to go to the advent festival.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yor wasn’t too keen on that idea, but decided to return to her home country for the sake of her friend.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But now they’re interested in the way I use magic. According to Yor, my method isn’t normal. Yor is so excited about it that Leila had to translate what she said for me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">And so, I said I’d tell her what I know about magic energy, and since the others also want to listen, we all came here.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ve been learning mostly on my own, and a lot of it is down to intuition, so don’t complain if I can’t explain very well.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I can’t forget to set up my defensive line.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“This is what I learned. First recite an incantation, then the name of the spell, and the magic activates.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">To be more precise, this isn’t something I learned, it’s more just something I heard.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. That’s what we do!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yor answers right away, probably because I talked to her before.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And the magic I use is like, imagine generating magic energy with an incantation, and converting it to magic by chanting the name of the spell.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That sounds complicated.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Does it? I’m probably just bad at explaining.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I have to draw a diagram, and I think I get my point across, at least just a little.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And so, I made that wall and reinforced it with magic by making that magic energy flow instead of converting it by casting a spell.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Making magic energy flow??”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can’t you do it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ve never even thought about it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yor looks surprised, and the other five don’t look like they understand it either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Apparently they don’t learn this in the academy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It seems normally casting magic is one singular process, from chanting to activation.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Do you feel like you can do it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">The six girls test it immediately.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I want to do it too, master.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari has been saying she wants to use magic for a while. But her capacity for magic energy… It looks like it has increased.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It feels like a lot more than the last time I checked with Magic Energy Detection.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But I can’t teach the basics of magic, so I think she should learn the basics from someone who knows a lot about magic.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I wish there was a place where you could learn about magic.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then come to the Magius academy!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yor immediately responds to my mumbling.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Isn’t there any place in the holy kingdom?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know… They’re one, two, three cuts below.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But aren’t there conditions to join that academy?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“There’s a basic academic test. There’s a practical test too, but I think that one makes the tuition lower if you ace it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That is correct. It is an academy to learn magic to begin with, so most people who join it can’t use magic when they enter it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Clarifies Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But don’t you use magic by learning skills?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That is how it’s thought of outside of the Magic State of Efa.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So it’s wrong?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. The Magic State of Efa has been researching magic for many years, and according to their research, you can at least somewhat use magic if you learn its basics. But it’s not always possible to go beyond that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. So we could stop by there if we have the chance.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“Yes.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">We can’t spend one or two years there, but we could spend some time there after I achieve my objective.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hm… I can’t do it at all. Is there any sort of trick to it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">The first one to comment on it is Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She has this air around her of a reliable big sister, but does she actually have no patience?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You should try harder. It’s going to make a big difference in your fighting power if you’re able to do this.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“How so?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She bit.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Should I just make a demonstration?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can you lend me your sword?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I take a weapon an orc was using out of the Item Box. It’s not sharp, but it’s thick. It was used by an orc after all.</p>
	<p class="block_2">“Do you think this mithril sword can cut this?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I ask while taking her sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t think so. Mithril is strong, and better than normal ore, but I don’t think it can cut that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, as it is, it can’t. The most it could do would be to chip its. But infusing magic energy into the mithril blade changes that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hand the orc weapon to Leila and ask her to hold it up. I also don’t forget to tell the others to stay near the wall, because it’s dangerous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I infuse the mithril sword with magic energy. By activating Magic Energy Detection, I can see it covers the whole sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Here I go.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I say, and lightly swing the mithril sword.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The mithril sword then slices the orc weapon in two without much resistance.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The broken piece falls to the ground with a loud thud, before the room becomes quiet.</p>
