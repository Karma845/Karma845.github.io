<h1>Chapter 1: The Princess Runs Away From Me</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was getting dark when the moon appeared beyond the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raize, are you done with the documents for the evening conference?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was sitting in my office, staring at a huge pile of papers, someone opened the door unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing there was a woman with a petite face and long red hair that faded into orange as it approached the ends. Her eyes were crimson, and she looked both elegant and intelligent. I wasn’t sure how her eyesight was, but she wore black-rimmed glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I was staring at her, I managed to reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Milena-san… Could you please knock the door properly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I didn’t? My bad. I’ll be careful next time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone was indifferent, as if she didn’t even think about it. It probably wasn’t even on purpose, but I didn’t know how many times I’d heard those words already. No matter how many times I mentioned it, she never tried to fix it. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I’m already used to it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, the documents?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m done. Oh, it seemed tedious to read as text-only, so I added a graph.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I like boys that work hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I handed over the documents and gently stretched, staring out the window that was opened for ventilation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A little white bird flew down and perched on the windowsill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I beckoned to it, the bird hopped towards my hand, chirping. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cute.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was petting the bird with my fingers, Milena-san rolled up the papers and tapped my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect as usual. Good job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you gotten used to your work? Even though it’s technically not your main job, you end up having to do a lot of random tasks, like preparing materials for meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The work environment is good, and the work itself is pretty simple. Everyone has been nice to me so far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it is. As expected from the genius youngest court magician in history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please stop saying that. Who even came up with that in the first place? They shouldn’t spread rumors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, okay. It’s not exactly a bad thing, so don’t get angry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop treating me like a child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhmm, sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned sixteen this year, so technically I still wasn’t an adult. In this country, eighteen was the age of adulthood, so it was inevitable that others would see me as a child. But I always wished they would stop.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I may be a minor, but I’m also a court magician in the royal palace. Can’t you treat me as if I was a little bit more mature?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone else in the department was of age, so I stuck out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was sulking, Milena-san chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t look so dissatisfied. Do you know where Elt is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, is he not in his office?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have a feeling he’s skipping work again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My senior Elt-san, with whom I often ate lunch, had an annoying habit of shirking his work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was troublesome for our department. He was reliable in an emergency, but I wanted him to work seriously and regularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“While we’re hard at work, he’s already…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You could learn from him, Raize. You’re working a little too hard, aren’t you? Have you taken a break besides lunch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had an amazed tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a newcomer, I don’t think I should be taking breaks. Rather, I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself for taking a break while everyone else was working… or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that I was working when I wasn’t having lunch. But it didn’t feel like a nuisance at all. Rather, it made me feel satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I tried to explain, she would probably ignore me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyways, I’ll give you a break, so take one. Oh, but that doesn’t mean you can smoke, okay? You’re still a minor, and I hate smoking. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate smoking too, so don’t worry. And I don’t want to take a break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an order from your chief. Take a break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Milena-san was my direct superior. I couldn’t argue… better not push it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed the little bird on the top of my head, picked up my flask, and left the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likely because my department was small, every person had their own office. For that reason, I was mostly alone at work… although my seniors did visit my office relatively often to check on the newcomer. They were all nice people for the most part. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it would be nice if they stopped taking snacks from my office and using up my tea leaves.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down at the edge of the fountain in the center of the royal garden and put my flask to my mouth. The ice inside made a gentle clinking sound. The tea was refreshing. Adding the ice was worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bird perching on my head whistled, but I couldn’t give it any tea. Could birds even drink it in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, in the hallway of the royal palace—if you stared at the pillars you would see it almost every day, but you would never be able to speak a word about it—the beautiful princess appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her beautiful hair, like silver thread, swayed behind her, and her similarly silver eyes were wandering gloomily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if she was feeling troubled about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Should I ask her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Talking to her wasn’t that big of a risk, but I was nervous. If my attitude were perceived as disrespectful, I could leave this world forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the princess looked worried… Leaving her alone just felt wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up from the edge of the fountain and approached the Princess quietly. She didn’t seem to notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was near enough to speak to her, I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something the matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness blinked rapidly. Her surprised expression was amazingly cute. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I’ll keep that thought to myself.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body stiffened and her face, mouth agape, turned red. I was about to call her again when her hands began moving frantically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh—that’s—what is it!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pardon me. You’re wearing quite a troubled expression… and your face is unnaturally red. Are you feeling unwell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I brought my face closer out of worry, Her Highness turned her back to me and held her cheeks in her hands.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, did I do something rude? My future may be in jeopardy already!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kneeled on the spot and gave a heartfelt apology. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll have to throw away my pride right now.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m very sorry! I have shown you terrible disrespect, even though this is our first time meeting!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will leave at once. Please forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this stage, I could only do my best to apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if it was enough, but it was definitely better than doing nothing. While waiting for her words with my head down, I heard a panicked voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, what, why are you apologizing?! I’m…rude. You don’t have to apologize! Rather, that….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t quite hear that last part. When I asked her to repeat herself, Her Highness snapped her mouth shut and, though I wouldn’t have thought it possible, her face glowed an even brighter red than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She ran away from me with the speed of a hare. Despite wearing a long skirt that seemed like it would hinder movement, she was surprisingly fast. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Does she run regularly or something?</span></i></p>
