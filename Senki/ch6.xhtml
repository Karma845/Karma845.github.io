<h1>Chapter 6: My Strange Table Partner</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s pretty crowded…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at Cafe Cherry, the store was not yet open, but I saw more than a dozen women lined up at the entrance. The ones at the front might have been waiting since early morning. Personally, I wouldn’t have risen early for it, but women were the primary demographic anyways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed a woman, possibly a clerk, holding a sign indicating the end of the line, and made my way toward her. After lining up, I opened my pocket watch. It was opening time precisely. One by one, those who were lined up in front of me entered the shop.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, I should be able to head back soon.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next customer, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you be dining in?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To go, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In no time, I had reached the register.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the display lined with pastries and located the particular marron cake that Arina-san had ordered me to buy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were exactly five slices remaining. Not a surprise, since most people probably came for the new cake specifically. In fact, I was incredibly lucky for there to be any left at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could I get five slices of the marron cake—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to finish my order when I noticed something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman behind me had an exceedingly desperate look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason was fairly obvious. The marron cake she came for was about to be sold out right in front of her… But she looked like she was experiencing the end of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at me with puppy dog eyes. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, if you beg like that…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Four slices, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as a replacement, I added an ordinary berry cake to my order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So how did this happen?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced down at the shortcake and milk tea in front of me. I was currently sitting face to face with a woman at a table in the cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body was slim and her red eyes gazed strongly at me. She had glossy shoulder-length black hair. Objectively, she was beautiful. In fact, she was attracting some attention in the cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at me and occasionally brought her hand to her chin, as if she were thinking of what to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, why am I having tea with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I felt like it. Is there a problem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not really…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman answered my question firmly. Before, she looked like she was about to cry over a slice of cake, but now she almost seemed cunning. I didn’t really mind, but quite a few people would dislike this sort of personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, I didn’t mind at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a lot of other thoughts, but I decided to table them and focus on the cake in front of me. I pierced a strawberry with my fork and brought it to my mouth. The tart sweetness spread over my taste buds. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Delicious.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…You eat your strawberries first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Is there a difference?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I eat mine last. The last bite should be the best one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m eating the same thing either way, so it’s the same whether it’s first or last.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boys just don’t get it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t really care about the conversation we were having. I just wanted to leave already. If I didn’t get back early, Arina-san would beat me up. That was a joke… I think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the woman in front of me took a bite of her long-cherished marron cake, she smiled euphorically and let out a satisfied “Hmm~♡.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that’s good. I’m glad I escaped and came here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You escaped?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, forget I said that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyways, thank you very much. For this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman smiled as she poked at her cake with a fork.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you were practically begging me with your eyes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… I didn’t think the person in front of me would buy five. I mean, that’s just too much, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just running an errand. I couldn’t possibly eat this much alone. Not to mention the weight I’d gain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? The temperature in the store seemed to drop. Was it just my imagination?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s right… you have to think about your body, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not offending you, am I? I think you look wonderful, if I may.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, I appreciate it. Ah, it’s already this late. I have to be back by noon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman quickly cleaned her plate, and both of us stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should be heading back, too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? I’m sorry for forcing you to spend time with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s all right. Thank you for the cake.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the store and were about to part ways when someone called out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lena-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A middle-aged man in a butler’s uniform ran up to us and turned towards the woman. I had some idea of what was going on, but it still took me by surprise. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you’ve found me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t joke around! Do you know how much time we spent searching—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. If you want to lecture me, I’ll listen back home, so let’s leave first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you will be listening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The butler sighed in defeat and turned toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, it seems like the young lady has caused a great deal of trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, that’s… so she was a noblewoman after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, that was the feeling I had. She said she had escaped, so her family was probably high-ranking and somewhat restrictive of her freedom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The butler nodded and introduced the woman—Lena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is Lena Auguste, daughter of Duke Auguste of Floreid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lloyd. We’re done here, right? Let’s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The butler bowed and stood behind Lena.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you next time then, Raize.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have the chance to ask how she knew my name. She turned her back and strode away quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared in amazement at her shrinking back. Losing track of time, I stood there wondering if I had said or done anything disrespectful back there in the cafe.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…I may have been disrespectful the entire time.</span></i></p>
