<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_37">Chapter 76: Turmoil in the Holy City – Part two</h1>

	<p class="block_2">We walk without a particular destination in mind, and end up somewhere pretty far from the center. Did we take a wrong turn somewhere? Is it because we left the main street?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“We’ve come to a weird place. Let’s go back.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I try to do just that, but Hikari stops.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We hear footsteps echoing through this back alley, until one person jumps out in front of us, followed by ten more shortly after.</p>

	<p class="block_2">This person’s face is hidden by a hood attached to a loose robe, and when she notices us, she first stops but then runs towards us while screaming.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Help! I’m being chased!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She sounds like a woman, and also desperate. She goes around and hides behind me, but I’m not your shield, you know?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I turn back, but quickly look forward again, at the group in front of us.</p>

	<p class="block_2">They are all wearing robes with a light gray color that’s close to white, and all have the same necklaces.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can you hand her over to us?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Sure.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I say immediately in response to this grave voice, as I raise my arms to show I’m not resisting.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What are you talking about? Those are bad guys!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She screams close to my ears. Don’t do that, it’s making my ears ring.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Those people also seem taken aback, probably because they didn’t expect me to comply so easily.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I turn back and use Appraisal again, and then look forward and use Appraisal there again too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari looks uninterested.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I turn around, suddenly grab the girl wearing the robe, and throw her before she can say anything.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Sorry for the rough treatment, and I thank the blessing that is physical strengthening.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The girl draws a short arc as she flies towards a middle-aged man, who looks baffled as he stands in place and follows her with his eyes.</p>

	<p class="block_2">He then raises his arms to catch her, but is instead caught by a straight right punch that explodes on his left cheek.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The man is sent flying, and the girl lands.</p>

	<p class="block_2">This series of events feel like they freeze the air around us.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari is still looking like she doesn’t care, but is watching what’s going on.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What do you think you’re doing, throwing a helpless lady around like that? Are you some kind of fiend!? An idiot!? Brute!?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Insults start flying, but it’s my loss if I respond. I don’t want to get dragged into this weird mess. In fact, I’m the one that’s taken aback by how she hit him with no hesitation.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, can we go?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, just pretend you didn’t see anything. We didn’t see anything.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari asks to leave, probably sensing something’s not right, and I roll with it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hold it right there!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">The girl is about to step forward, but she’s stopped when her hand is grabbed from behind.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master!”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari sounds flustered.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I step forward and reach out, pushing her back, and a soft feeling spreads through the palm of my hand. I-it’s not like I did it on purpose. The girl jumps back towards the person behind her, and I feel an impact on my arm.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I grit my teeth. It hurts too much. Is Pain Reduction not working? Is this the effect of some sort of skill?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look at my arm and see an arrow piercing it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">While trying to bear the pain, I bring up Map with Presence Detection, and activate Magic Energy Detection too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I can see presences getting away at an incredible speed, probably because their sneak attack failed. Are they just sticking to their plan of retreating without firing again?</p>

	<p class="block_2">Both the girl in front of me and the group that was chasing her are dumbfounded by what just happened.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Only Hikari reacts, as she comes near me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But this prompts the other girl to move too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“L-let me see that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She reaches out to touch me, but I stop her with my other hand.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Wait, the arrow is probably coated with poison. Don’t touch it, it’s dangerous.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I yell as I try to bear the pain. It’s reverberating.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari looks worried, so I try to calm down a little. I twist my right arm to make it so I can more easily pull the arrow out with my left hand. It’s not just the arrowhead, the shaft is coated with poison too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I brace myself and pull the arrow out. Ooh… Blood is gushing.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I keep looking at it like I’m not the one bleeding, but at this rate I’m going to lose a lot of blood. But just as I’m thinking I have to cast healing magic, I hear someone say ‘heal’ from the side.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The girl is chanting healing magic.</p>
	<p class="block_2">After the wound in my arm closes, she casts ‘recovery’, and collapses like the strength has been drained from her body.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I can see through an opening in her robe that she looks pale. I catch her without even thinking, and her slender body feels strangely heavy. I don’t think she would even be able to stand if I let go.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I know these symptoms. She ran out of MP.</p>

	<p class="block_2">If I remember correctly, holy magic spends more MP than other kinds of magic. Her level seems low too, so she can’t have a lot of MP in the first place, right?</p>

	<p class="block_2">She should wake up if I give her a mana potion, but if I use it on someone who is unconscious… Uh? Now that I think about it, when I passed out due to running out of MP, I recovered a lot of MP by the time I woke up, and only MP… I’m pretty sure I changed jobs to sorcerer back then, so is that why?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What are you planning to do with her?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks the middle-aged man as I think.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I honestly don’t know what to do. It’s obvious that the arrow was aimed at her, but these people are members of the same church as her. I want to think they’re colleagues or something, but she was running. I was just going to hand her over to them, but this complicates things.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you people on her side?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I really don’t know, so I just ask directly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Of course. We cannot allow anyone to harm her.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">I get an immediate answer. I think he’s telling the truth, but I don’t have enough to reach a decision.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Even I have to ask myself why I thought asking that question would give me a definitive answer. I need to be a bit more cool-headed.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, what are you going to do?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“When in doubt, ask people who know what to do, I guess.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“H-hey. Where do you think you’re going?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Just shut up and follow me. I honestly don’t know if I can trust you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“W-what are you saying?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Their anger towards what I said seems to me like an overreaction, but I guess it can’t be helped. The situation changed. I collect the arrow and start walking.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The younger men seem to be saying something, but the middle-aged man decides to follow me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I think he reached the conclusion that I don’t want to harm this girl.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Of course, my destination isn’t the church. I go straight to the Apostel home. They’re related to the church, so they should know what to do.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I leave that group standing in a line in front of the house, as I ask the guards to go call Rondot for me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Welcome back. Who are these people?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">He asks as he looks at the girl in my arms and the people from the church lined up behind us.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I think I got roped into a bit of a problem. Can you please call the old… Mister Dan?”</p>
