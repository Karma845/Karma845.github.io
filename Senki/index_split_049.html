	<p class="block_2">“…About that last battle…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. I would have done this if it was me.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What should I have done if it was me?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“There is no right answer. But you heroes aren’t like us, correct? Heroes’ fighting techniques come from skills. I think that’s one way to push through.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But apparently using those too much makes the body feel heavy…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know about that sort of thing either, but… How about we learn what the limit is first?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Limit?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. But of course, there is still room to grow, and with that, those limits might increase too. But it might be good to examine the strain using multiple skills in a row has on the body.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s better than testing in actual combat, but…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. So let’s try testing it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Understood. But right now… That probably won’t be possible. Talk to me again when it’s time to perform these tests. Heroes’ attacks are very powerful, so we need to arrange a proper place for that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. I want to test that when I’m in the right physical condition for it, so tell me when you have everything ready.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…I was worried, but I’ve calmed down a lot. My tone and general attitude seems back to normal.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, that was pretty scary.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Was it really due to fighting too much?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Who knows? That might be it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hahaha, I’m sorry about that.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So you think it’s bad?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“O-of course. That time, well… I guess I saw too much blood. I got too excited as I fought. Chalk it up to youthful indiscretion.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You… Said some really bad things there, so make sure you apologize. The chivalric order is working hard to protect us.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Don’t worry about that, I’ve already done it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s good, just get it together. Remember, we’re counting on you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes sorry, I know you’re all adorably counting on me. I got carried away. Well then, I’m off.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“My head hurts. I’m not feeling bloodthirsty I guess, so I want to believe I’m fine.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Maybe you’ve been too busy. You were keeping pace with us at first, but I feel like you’ve been carrying one order after another lately.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“People from the church are worried too. They said they would talk to someone but…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, I’ll try talking to the captain too. I don’t think he’s resting lately either.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I want to head to town too if I can. Nothing dangerous, I just want to see what this world is like, since I’m here anyway.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ve seen the town when I go to church, from the inside of a wagon though.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ll ask about that too, and…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you thinking about him?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. Back then we were basically just being swept away by the situation around us… And we couldn’t do anything… But now I feel like we should have stopped them and told them to at least take care of him.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But he’s living in town, right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, and they say they’re supporting him financially, and guarding him without him knowing. He should be fine.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. He might actually know more about this world than us.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It’s more brutal for us. Even if we can cut through some danger because we have power.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But that also means we are made to fight…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Ah.. Stop… Stop it with the dark topics. Let’s ask about that too. Just seeing his face should make you feel more at ease, right?</p>

	<p class="block_3"><span class="text_">　◇</span><span class="text_1"> </span><span class="text_">◇</span><span class="text_1"> </span><span class="text_">◇</span></p>

	<p class="block_2">“What do you mean we can’t see him?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’m sorry. There is somewhere we want you heroes to go to as soon as possible.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…Where?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“A dungeon in the Magic State of Efa.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Dungeon?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Why do we need to go there?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It seems your progress has stagnated recently, so we want you to train and collect materials at the same time.”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“Materials?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. We need materials found in dungeons for the sake of getting your equipment in order as well…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can’t you ask anyone else?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“About that… In recent years, there hasn’t been anyone strong enough to venture to the lower levels… We also don’t want to gather materials in another country, but…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Understood. I feel like I’ve hit a wall when it comes to raising my level too. If going there will let me become stronger, I don’t mind.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“T-thank you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“All right. But we were promised we could see him, so why can’t we?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“W-well, the town is in a state of emergency.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Did something happen?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Y-yes, it seems a demon has appeared, and there is confusion within the chivalric order too.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Those are underlings of the demon king, right? But shouldn’t we go there, if something like that appeared?”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“Y-yes, I hear a specialist unit is handling that. We would like you to prepare to head to the dungeon. No one had ever seen a demon before, so for one to suddenly show up, it can only mean that the other side is about to really move out.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So we don’t have a lot of time? All right. What should we do?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“We are hurrying our preparations as well, and we will call you once we are ready. Get your equipment in order, and do whatever it is you do before you travel.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…But if they’re really about to move, as you said, is it a good idea for us to not be here?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. I don’t know why, but they say that they will know when the time comes.</p>
