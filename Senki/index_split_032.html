<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_34">Chapter 73: Combat Slave</h1>

	<p class="block_2">After taking a look, we go back to the previous room.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari is a bit frightened, but I actually noticed something interesting.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Cat ears!</p>

	<p class="block_2">I think I like dogs more, but cats are fine too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">No, forget that. It’s my first time seeing a beast person. So they really do exist… It really makes me feel like I’m in a fantasy world, like the first time I saw an elf or a dwarf.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“As you can see, she really hates us humans.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What happened to cause so much hate?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I can only tell you what was told to me, and I don’t know the details, but apparently she was made to fight in the dark forest as a combat slave.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Dark forest…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. I hear she was made to fight there for years. She survived that ordeal, but no one else who was in her group was as lucky. She returned alone a few times, and eventually people started to get creeped out. But surviving the dark forest means she is on par with an A ranked adventurer, if not better.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Being that strong should mean she would be treated well, but I’m assuming that’s not the case because she’s a slave, right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. Normally, being that strong would mean transcending that status, but all of her allies were always wiped out, and she lived in the empire, so her treatment never improved.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yes, that country believes in human supremacy. They signed a cease-fire, but their persecution never stopped.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“In the end, the noble who was her master didn’t like any of this, and harmed her under the pretext of educating her. However, he was hurt pretty badly in return, and since harming a slave is against the law even if you’re their master, it was ruled that he was responsible for what happened to him.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And that became a big deal?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, it was a problem for a while. If they executed her for that, I’m sure the republic wouldn’t stay quiet about it. And so, to avoid all that mess, she was sent to another country, the holy kingdom. And that brings us to this point.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Wouldn’t it be simpler to send her to the republic? Is there any reason why they couldn’t do that?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. If I were to buy her, how much would that cost me?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Well… She is difficult to handle, but also very able, so five hundred gold coins, yes.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Five hundred gold coins…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s a lot, but it does make sense considering her level. She’s far above anyone I used People Appraisal on.</p>

	<p class="block_2">And…</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t have enough on me, so can you put her aside for now?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Put aside?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, like a reservation. I want to buy her if I have enough money on a certain day, so how about we make a deal, and you don’t sell her until then?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. I don’t mind, if you pay for her expenses until said day that is. I wouldn’t normally accept such a deal, but I will because Drekk sent you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t know how true that is, but it looks like he’ll keep her for me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The most I can scrape together now is three hundred gold coins. Would it be too difficult to save up the remaining two hundred before the advent festival is over? What if I pick medicinal herbs and mass produce potions?</p>

	<p class="block_2">If my demand for a platinum coin actually goes through… No, I can’t use that even if I get my hands on it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">After thinking about it for a bit, I tell him to hold her for me for twenty days, and pay for her expenses for that time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I want to talk to her before I leave, so I ask to speak with her alone, without Drett.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’m Sora. Can we talk for a bit?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’m somewhat of a peddler, and I’ve been looking for someone who can be my guard. I heard you’re strong, so I was thinking maybe…”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then look somewhere else. There should be other slaves here that can fight.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I did see some people, but they were no good. I need someone who can at least fight a superior species and escape.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Superior species? Are you trying to become an adventurer and make a lot of money that way or something?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“No way. But I’ve heard rumors of two superior species since I came here, and actually encountered one. Lately even just traveling is becoming dangerous, so doesn’t it make sense to hire someone strong?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She doesn’t respond. It looks like she’s thinking, but she doesn’t say anything.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And I’m planning to sell things in different countries, so if I have the chance, I might stop by the Republic of Eldo.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She raises her head in reaction to those words, and for the first time, I feel like I see an emotion other than anger on her face. Although I don’t know what it is exactly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s it. Just remember that if I buy you, that could be on the horizon. But I still need to come up with a little more money.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then come back when you have money.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She said it bluntly, but her words lack the sting they had at first. That was a bit too simple, wasn’t it?</p>

	<p class="block_2">No, that’s probably just how much the Republic of Eldo means to her.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ll try to meet your expectations. I’ll come back later, Sera.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I say before I go back to Drett.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hear a gasp behind me. Did something happen?</p>

	<p class="block_2">It looks like I’m going to be busy, mostly trying to earn money. Ahh… Isn’t there any way to make a lot of money fast?</p>

	<p class="block_2">For now, I’ll go back and talk to Leila.</p>
