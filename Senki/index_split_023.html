<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_25">Chapter 64: Battle – Part eleven</h1>

	<p class="block_2">Two more days have passed, and the merchant caravan should be here in a day.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Luilui has noticed this too, but we haven’t told anyone except for the adventurers.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We’re worried that people might let their guard down and become careless if they expect to leave here soon.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But the caravan isn’t the only thing on the move. The group of orcs is moving too, even though they were in front of the cave all this time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Considering what time it is now, they should be crossing through the forest during the night, and might even attack before the sun rises.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We share this information with the people in the inn, and it creates a tense atmosphere.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The merchants that are camping outside probably sense this restlessness inside, because they start making a ruckus even though they were quiet all this time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Stop treating me like this at once. I’ll sue you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Give me more food. Who do you think I am?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ll be reporting this to the guild. And don’t come to me to apologize, because by then it will be too late.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">They keep complaining.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That’s right, they are all merchants, aren’t they? Some are part of companies, if I remember correctly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">In a way, it’s strange that no adventurers made it back.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We’ve been giving them the minimum necessary to survive. It’s not much, but it is free. They’re not helping us with anything either. They keep making excuses.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Shut up for a minute. We don’t have time to hear your nonsense.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yells the villager in charge of dealing with them, probably because he’s on edge.</p>

	<p class="block_2">They respond with such dirty language that it makes me want to cover my ears. Locke can’t stand by and watch anymore, and steps forward.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The merchants that were speaking to the villager with loud and confident voices become gradually quieter as Locke approaches.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I told you before, if you have any complaints you can get out of here. Did you forget that already?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Locke is in a bad mood, and feels more intense than usual.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ll warn you now. Orcs are coming to attack, so if you keep making noise, I won’t have mercy on you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">He says, and leaves before they can respond. I guess they’re getting tossed out if they keep acting like this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Good job dealing with them.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I was just the right person at the right time.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then let us talk about putting the right people at the right time to deal with the orcs. I think I would want to intercept them in the forest.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can I ask why?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“First, we have magic items that allow us to see in the dark. Also, I don’t want to fight that group on an even playing field.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. There are fifteen of them, and it will probably be even trickier because they have an orc general commanding them.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Talia adds to Leila’s answer.</p>

	<p class="block_2">They’re speaking from experience, after fighting them in the cave.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you talking about abandoning our defensive position?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Talia, Casey, and I will be the only ones going to the forest.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Isn’t that dangerous?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“We are not going there to take out every orc. We will reduce their numbers and retreat while luring them.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then can I go too, master?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I guess so. You’re better suited for this than me, so I’ll leave it to you.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Are you sure about this?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Locke, but I assure him it’s fine.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then you should take potions. Be especially careful about not running out of magic energy. Hikari, I’m counting on you to support them.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, leave it to me.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I give the four girls the items they’ll need, and start preparing too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Luilui and I go up to the watchtower, and stand-by as Yor, Locke, and the others stay by the gate. We keep watch in shifts as we wait for the time to come.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The battle begins in the middle of the night.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I see the battle from afar, or rather, by looking at Map and using both Presence Detection and Magic Energy Detection.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We need to defend this place if something happens, so all we can do now is trust them and wait.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Talia and Hikari are running around in the forest. Talia was pretty quick to learn how to use magic energy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She dispatches an orc right after coming across it, but apparently it takes a big toll on her, because she drinks a mana potion right after taking down another one, to restore spent magic energy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hikari is steadily fighting them by paralyzing them.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila and Casey are holding steady and fighting off the orcs. I think they’re hiding behind trees and using sneak attacks to take down the orcs that get near them.</p>
	<p class="block_2">Leila and Casey’s reactions overlap with an orc’s, and the orc’s reaction disappears instantly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hear constant screaming and loud yells from the forest. The noise is loud enough to wake the people that were sleeping.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Do you know what’s happening out there?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Talia and Hikari are doing a good job reducing their numbers, but apparently the orcs are becoming more wary of coming this way. Their movements are changing too.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I check this by using Map. The orcs were all scattered, but they are now converging on a single spot. I figure based on the magic energy there that they’re gathering around the orc general.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Still, nine were brought down by the sneak attack. Only six remain.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Should we send them a signal?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I ask.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. I’ll break the link once the signal has been sent.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">As we talk, two more reactions disappear.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Was it to keep them from joining the other orcs?</p>
	<p class="block_2">Oh? The orcs are already surrounded.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hold on.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What is it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can you see what’s going on inside the forest?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Hum, uh?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Another one is down. Are there only two left?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…It looks like the orcs are surrounded.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Luilui is surprised too. The general is still standing, but aren’t they taking them down a bit too fast?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Should we just leave this to them?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. Sending them a signal now would probably just break their concentration.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">In the end, we don’t send the signal to retreat.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Luilui says it’s over, so she tells Locke about it and I head to the forest.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m going there to retrieve the fallen orcs into the Item Box, and to learn exactly what went down here.</p>
