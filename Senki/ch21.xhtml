<h1>Chapter 21: Doubts Fall Into Place</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time flew and the royal parade began without any hiccups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“…. So far there is no sign of any suspicious activity. The parade is going well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”… All right. Please don’t harm the surrounding buildings and common people, will you? There’s been a lot of dangerous and nasty incidents these days. If a suspicious person causes trouble…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before he can, we will deal with it secretly and assassinate him. No matter how far he runs, I will surely kill him.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the spirit. I’m counting on you, sniper.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of communication being cut off rang in my ear. I immediately removed the small device from my ear and stored it in the chest part of the robe.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It is now evening and the sun is about to set. The western horizon was dyed in brilliant red, and I could see several birds flying toward the sun.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">After I successfully sent the princess to her private chambers without anyone noticing, I immediately returned to my office to finalize my preparations for the given guard duty.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I’m in a black but plain robe without any embroidery and a special pair of boots with the magic of erasing footsteps. I secured my rapier sword at my waist. I’m wearing a complete combat uniform, watching the carriage in which Her Highness is riding from afar, making note of every little detail. I’m also monitoring the royal guards for any suspicious behavior.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the invisibility magic has been invoked on me, no one can see me. I feel like I’m an assassin after Her Highness. Of course, the reality is that I’m a knight of justice who protects her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it is strangely exciting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw the myriad of knights and magicians surrounding the carriage from afar and then the people cheering around her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a tremendous frenzy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">They have finally seen the royal family that they rarely see. Especially the most popular of them all, Her Highness. No wonder.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the princess is now wearing a formal dress which is in the color of light blue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The clothes of the town girls were very cute, but when the princess dressed up, she was even more attractive and full of charm, captivating everyone who saw her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s like a beautiful sculpture that you’ll never get tired of seeing.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost fell in love with her, but I managed to push that thought aside in time. There should be no such thing as a failure to escort Her Highness just because I was fascinated by her looks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, risk factors are already scattered. I have to brace myself.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Once invisible, I activated visual enhancement as well. I can even see the micro expressions and subtle movements of the guards who couldn’t see me because of the distance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The way they blink or how the blood vessels on their necks twitch occasionally… I could clearly catch everything, including the direction of their eyes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“…something is strange, indeed.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my eyes from the magicians escorting near Her Highness to the strange members of the royal guard who I’ve heard from her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights’ swords hanging from their waists swayed, and their unlined uniforms were full of knighthood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But their faces, in contrast to what they were wearing, seemed somewhat empty, and their gazes could not tell where they were looking. Their skin was strangely white, and their veins didn’t seem to move at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s obviously a strange sight.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be very rude to the knights, but they look like zombie soldiers. I can’t feel any vitality from them. As if they were already dead… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reinforced my visual enhancement and turned my eyes to the private house in front of me when I sensed a suspicious movement there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be exact, on the roof of that private house, was a creepy figure crawling on all fours, staring intently at the princess. The figure, clad in a large piece of black cloth, was wrapped in magic. His mouth was wide open while he drooled like an animal, and his eyes locked on the princess in the carriage as if he wanted to bite her to death.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”… Blue Electric Blade Transmitter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I pulled out the rapier, a blue thunder poured from the blade and made a snap sound for a second before heading for its target.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps he noticed the sound, because that figure turned to me and glared viciously.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But it’s too late.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The thunder has reached the top of his head and cut himself in two. High-temperature thunder burned the meat and the debris rolled onto the roof without spilling a single drop of blood. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Confirmed complete death and sword delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Attribute Long Distance Advanced Magic – Blue Electric Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a magic where a bluish thunder from the rapier flies to the target and burns it off like an ultra-high temperature sword.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately turned to Her Highness, but there seemed to be nothing different. Even now, she is all smiles and waving gracefully to the people. It’s very beautiful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my eyes from the beautiful princess to the slightly dirty and ugly four-legged body. Smoke was coming from the burnt black corpse of the disgusting four-legged creature.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I got ready to jump to a different hiding spot to make sure that I’m not discovered…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just before I did, the big black piece of cloth the body was covered in was blown away by the wind, and I was greatly shocked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”This!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my eyes wide and looked at the body clearly before turning to the knights guarding the princess, forgetting to breathe.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The corpse wore the same red and white uniform worn by members of the Royal Guard. And the magic formula of mind control, which I saw the other day, is on the cut off neck.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as my doubts turned to conviction, I… </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, thank you for your hard work in the parade.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">When the parade ended successfully and the sky was completely dark, I was greeted by the guards right in front of the main entrance of the royal palace.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much. But it is you, the bodyguards, who worked hard. I was just waving to the people from a carriage. While you people were guarding the carriage and walking along the long streets of the royal capital.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, we knights are obliged to protect the royal family. It is our priority to make sure you are safe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“…ah, thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight bowed his head in a smooth motion. I know I have to say thank you purely here… but I wonder why I have this disgusting and unpleasant feeling…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, there is still some time before you speak. Why don’t you rest in the room beside the people’s room?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t believe my ears for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people’s room is a large veranda with a panoramic view of the central square that exists in the royal palace. It is a traditional place used by kings for generations to speak to the people of the royal capital. I know that there is a waiting room next to it. But…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I always rest in my private room, so I think I’ll head there…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, rest in another room. We must have you do so because of the guards.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The Knight, speaking in an emotionless voice, slowly drew out the sword from his waist.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked around unconsciously, I saw the remaining knights draw out their swords before pointing them at me squarely. Not too far, the magicians who were supposed to be in charge of my security detail lay motionless, bleeding.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”What…“</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Your Highness, come this way,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As I step back from them, I press my trembling hand against my chest. This situation is absolutely fatal. I can’t see anyone around me to help me. And if I have to overcome this situation by myself… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could think anymore, I was grabbed by the wrist and pulled forcefully. I couldn’t help but fall down and rub my painful knee. Before I could worry if the wound drew out blood, I was dragged away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s nothing I can do about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I gave up resisting, and just closed my eyes…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, all of a sudden, the grip on my wrist relaxed, no, it completely disappeared.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I was gently hugged and felt the wind caress my skin as a clear and beautiful voice whispered gently in my ear.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Your Highness. I’m late.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly opened my eyes and found a beautiful boy with indigo hair and eyes of the same color staring at me anxiously.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Raize-sama…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it was scary, but it’s all right now. From now on, I will… no, we will protect you.”</span></p>
