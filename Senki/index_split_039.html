	<p class="block_2">How did I get here?</p>

	<p class="block_2">Mia is sitting in front of me. No one else is here.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We gathered in the same room as always to study, I said I was leaving the rest to them, and came back to my room to make some things with Alchemy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That was just two hours ago.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But then I heard a light knock on the door, and opened it to find Mia by herself, meekly dropping her shoulders.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So you tried all sorts of things and nothing worked?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She weakly nods.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila, Yor, and the others have been teaching Hikari and Yuri based on their experiences, and their study sessions have been productive.</p>

	<p class="block_2">And yet, it’s not working. Especially when they tried to explain to Mia how to correct her holy magic from scratch. She had no idea what they were talking about.</p>

	<p class="block_2">What’s she thinking going to someone she rejected so strongly? Is she just that desperate?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What part of it don’t you understand?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Basically everything.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She says bluntly.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Well, you know holy magic, so did someone teach you how to use it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“No. It just sort of popped into my head and I started using it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Now that I think about it, she didn’t chant anything when she cast Heal and Recovery.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She just said the names of the spells and they activated instantly, didn’t they?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Can you try using Heal again?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“All right… Heal.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yes. Even with Magic Energy Detection, I didn’t sense so much as a fluctuation in her magic energy before she cast it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“W-was there anything weird about it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She looks worried. I probably have a grave look on my face again.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The way she uses magic feels close to mine. Like she doesn’t have to chant a long incantation to use magic either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Did they show the magic stone we use to practice?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And you tried to infuse it with magic energy?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I tried it after they explained how, but it didn’t work at all? Magic energy? I couldn’t sense that either.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hm… That’s a problem. Her starting line is feeling magic energy. If she can’t do that, it’s hopeless. I can feel magic energy because of the Magic Energy Control skill, but…</p>

	<p class="block_2">Do I have that look on my face again? She looks worried. Looking at her kind of reminds me of an abandoned puppy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“W-what’s so funny?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Was I smiling? The worried look on her face disappears and is replaced by pouting with puffed cheeks.</p>

	<p class="block_2">So she can make faces that are appropriate for her age too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That sort of stiff air around her, like she’s trying too hard, is nowhere to be seen at this moment.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Someone in a grand position like a saint probably doesn’t get too many chances to relax.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Give me your hands.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She complies, and I grab her hands. She looks surprised, and faces down as her face turns red.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That reaction is going to make me feel self-conscious too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I don’t know if it will work, but I’m going to try making magic energy flow to you. Tell me if you feel anything.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She nods, and I make some magic energy flow to my right hand.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“So? Did you feel anything?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“…I don’t know.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then I’m going to make it a little stronger this time. Tell me if you feel it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I increase the amount of magic energy, and adjust as I look at her expression.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hn… I see a slightly unnatural movement in her eyes. Did she feel something?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It feels weird, but I have a feeling like there’s something warm flowing in the palm of my left hand.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. Then I’m going to make it a little stronger.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I gradually increase the strength of the magic energy, and see Mia is starting to breathe heavily.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“A-are you all right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Y-yes. I am. Can you make it a little stronger? I feel like I’m almost on to something.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She says with a serious expression and a wrinkle between her eyebrows. I can tell she’s really trying to grasp something.</p>
	<p class="block_2">I do as she says and increase the strength of the flow of magic energy even more. I’ve been adjusting it, but won’t it backfire or something if the magic energy flows in a weird way? I’m a little worried, but as far as I can see, the flow of magic energy is still all right.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The magic energy leaving my body through my right hand is transmitted throughout her body and returns through my left hand.</p>

	<p class="block_2">…She’s kind of trembling and moaning but… Does she not notice that?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I feel like I’m seeing something I shouldn’t, and look away from Mia.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Ooh… Looking away actually just made it weirder. Not seeing something makes the imagination have to fill the gaps. Am I being tested? If someone were to open the door right now… Would I be executed?</p>

	<p class="block_2">In this quiet room, only Mia’s… Discomposed? Breathing echoes.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Free your mind. Clear away obstructive thoughts.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t know how long this goes on for, but eventually I hear a big sigh coming from her.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s enough. I think I get it somehow.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">There are large drops of sweat on her forehead, but she is smiling from the bottom of her heart.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That smile shakes me a little, no, that wonderful smile shakes me a lot. I stare at her without even realizing.</p>
	<p class="block_2">“What is it?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I was just thinking that your smile is beautiful.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Ah, I shouldn’t have said that. She just asked me all of a sudden and the words came out of my mouth.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Her face turns even more red.</p>

	<p class="block_2">We’re still holding hands, and we both notice it at the same time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She tries to pull away, but I grab them a little tighter.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I-I didn’t mean to upset you. Ahem. Let’s do it again, to make sure you don’t forget that feeling. And this time, you make magic energy flow.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. I understand.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Her embarrassment is gone, and she looks serious.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Start when you feel like it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I relax my body and wait.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She takes a few deep breaths, before she suddenly stops, closes her eyes, and focuses.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Time keeps passing, and I don’t feel anything on the palm of my hand, even if I focus.</p>

	<p class="block_2">More time passes, and I say nothing as I feel nothing.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Mia takes a deep breath, raises her head, and kind of looks like she’s about to cry.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I let go of her hands, which are covered in sweat.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“No one can do it right from the beginning. Let’s take this one step at a time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She lowers her head, and doesn’t say anything.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I wipe my hands, and give her a few taps on the head before patting it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">She raises her head again, and our eyes meet.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I’ll say it again, no one can do it right from the start. Let’s try again tomorrow.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then let’s rest for today.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I didn’t notice this, probably because I was focused, but we’ve been at this for a while. Enough for the color of the sunlight entering through the window to change.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Mia goes back to her room, and I stay here, thinking by myself.</p>
	<p class="block_2">But I can’t think of any magic items that can make it so she can feel magic energy. There’s nothing in the list of the Alchemy skill either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The world isn’t that convenient. I lay down on the bed, and let go of my consciousness. Ah… I’m tired in more ways than one.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s almost time to eat, but I need to rest for a bit.</p>
