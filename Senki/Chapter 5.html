<h2>Chapter 5: Beside the Strongest Shield, Always Stands the Strongest Spear</h2>
<p>“Heh… That butler is a real monster…”</p>
<p>Pressing my left arm, which had suffered necrosis due to the pseudo-contract with etoile’s key, I cursed in an alley away from the magic museum.</p>
<p>The plan was perfect. Despite some unexpected interruptions, it was mostly going smoothly. I obtained etoile’s key, sacrificed my left arm to activate the unique ability through the pseudo-contract, and successfully connected with the Amplification Gem. The enormous black sphere floating in the sky above the imperial capital, Mifras, should be transmitting the ‘Discord’ of etoile’s key throughout the entire city.</p>
<p>If nothing goes wrong, many lives will disappear from this world within the next two hours. My long-cherished wish for revenge will finally be fulfilled.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“Surely, it won’t be that easy.”</p>
<p>In my mind, I saw the butler and the princess.</p>
<p>Roth alone, with the Sixth heaven Key, possessing an absolute defense magic, is already a formidable opponent. And on top of that, the Imperial Princess Krell Carreralonde, also known as the strongest in the world. I never imagined it would turn out like this. I sent the notice in advance to enter the ‘Key Chamber’ during the hours when there are no visitors, so only the director could enter at night… but it totally backfired. I never thought it would attract a jinx, really bad luck. The assassination attempt also failed and enraged Roth.</p>
<p>Those two will undoubtedly head to destroy the black sphere in the sky. They have the power to make it happen.</p>
<p>I hope that nothing happens, that time passes without any incident.</p>
<p>With a fleeting and impossible wish in my heart, I leaned against the wall and sat on the cobblestones, letting my hands free from the wound that had stopped bleeding. I grabbed the gem with the blood-stained hand.</p>
<p>Just a bit more… a little longer…</p>
<p>If only I could endure a little more time.</p>
<p>“I’m coming for you… Lady Rias.”</p>
<p>I muttered the name of the person who I could no longer see.</p>
<p>If… there is a heavenly kingdom and I can meet her there… I wonder if she would forgive me. She would probably be really angry and give me a big lecture that would scare me. But in the end, I think she would forgive me and say, “Let’s make it up together,” because she’s that kind of person.</p>
<p>I daydreamed about that scene and slowly closed my eyes――when.</p>
<p>“――Ah!!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As we jumped down from the hole in the wall and left the museum, I and Princess Krell ran at full speed towards the black<br />
sphere floating in the sky, rushing through the streets of the imperial capital. Stepping on the cobblestones, kicking the<br />
walls of buildings, running full speed on rooftops, we aimed to reach our destination as soon as possible. At this moment, I<br />
gratefully felt the cold air outside, which I normally found chilly.</p>
<p>Jumping from roof to roof, we crossed over the waterway by leaping over a small boat floating on it, and then I slowed down, turning my gaze towards Princess Krell in my arms.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Princess Krell?”</p>
<p>“I feel so sorry…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell, being carried princess-style, exuded a gloomy atmosphere while crossing her index fingers.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Princess Krell is a true klutz. She basically spins her wheels in whatever she does and creates trouble, so much so that she can be called a mass-production machine for failures. If I let Princess Krell run in this situation where we must reach the black sphere as soon as possible, her lack of coordination combined with mental anxiety would lead to even more falls than usual. We don’t have time to spare now, and I can’t afford to let her get injured.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m carrying Princess Krell and running at full speed. This is currently the fastest way for us to reach the scene.</p>
<p>Princess Krell, filled with intense self-loathing, self-deprecated.</p>
<p>“I’m causing so much trouble for Roth… I’m really useless. Oh? What is thess salty water …?”</p>
<p>“No time for tears, Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>I comforted her while running again. She’s a person who needs care. That’s also one of her endearing qualities.</p>
<p>“As I said before, as long as I’m with you, Princess Krell, you are the perfect and strongest. I’ll cover all the clumsy and useless parts, so you just focus on what only you can do.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… yes.”</p>
<p>“On the flip side, without me, you are far from capable.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t add to the injury…”</p>
<p>“It’s the truth.”</p>
<p>I kicked the wall again and jumped to the roof of the building.</p>

<p>The distance to the black sphere has gotten quite close, but the imperial capital is vast, so we still have a long way to run. We’ve covered about a third of the distance from our starting point.</p>
<p>I checked the time on my wristwatch and saw that ten minutes had passed since we left the museum. To cover this distance in just ten minutes is quite impressive. However, even though I am an excellent butler, I can’t keep running endlessly. I need to take a break to catch my breath and recover.</p>
<p>Embracing the sensation of the cold night air cooling down my elevated body temperature, I set Princess Krell down for a moment.</p>
<p>“I apologize. I will catch my breath quickly, so please wait for a moment.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay… well, we are in a situation where we need to hurry, but there’s no need to keep running without restoring your stamina. Take your time.”</p>
<p>While feeling grateful for Princess Krell’s gentle words and understanding, I shared what I had been thinking since we left the museum.</p>
<p>“It’s not in a negative way, but honestly, I’m surprised.”</p>
<p>“Surprised? How so?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought you would be more panicky and flustered.”</p>
<p>After hearing the ‘Discord’ sound produced by etoile’s key, I realized that I would die in two hours if nothing changes. Although I managed to avoid losing consciousness and sleep like the others, my life force was still disrupted. I can run at full speed, but my breath becomes shorter than usual, and my fatigue increases.</p>
<p>Princess Krell should be aware of my current condition… despite that, she hasn’t expressed any words of worry or complaints at all.</p>
<p>That was quite surprising… and after hearing my words, Princess Krell smiled.</p>
<p>“I understand that Roth’s life is at risk too. But I don’t think it’s the time to panic and lose control.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think that way?”</p>
<p>“Because… I have you by my side.”</p>
<p>“――”</p>
<p>I never expected to receive such words in response, and I was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p>Seeing my reaction, Princess Krell seemed to be in a better mood and continued with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Just as you protect me and won’t let me die, I won’t let you die either. We’ll definitely survive… and welcome tomorrow together.”</p>
<p>“Let’s get married.”</p>
<p>“Why on earth does the topic of marriage come up in this situation!”</p>
<p>Hearing Princess Krell’s words, which resonated deeply with my heart, I unintentionally proposed. Even though I said it unconsciously, I should apologize… no, wait. The fact that it came out is all because Princess Krell is too adorable. In other words, the cause lies with Princess Krell. It’s her who should apologize. I want her to apologize.</p>
<p>“Really… if you’ve recovered, let’s go immediately? There’s no time to waste with things like this.”</p>
<p>“No problem. My breath has stabilized, so I can run again. Of course, after we arrive, I’ll need to ask for your help, Princess Krell, so be prepared for that.”</p>
<p>“I understand. But… if Roth isn’t here, there will be tremendous damage around us.”</p>
<p>“Seriously, the entire capital might be wiped out. That’s why I’m here, so that won’t happen.”</p>
<p>Princess Krell’s magic consists mainly of ultra-high firepower. While she can adjust the power to some extent, unfortunately, she hasn’t mastered precise control of fine magic. Despite her daily efforts, it’s not something that can be easily acquired.</p>
<p>As I prayed that the current view of the city wouldn’t disappear, I surveyed the imperial capital.</p>
<p>“Princess Krell… did you see the people in the city?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Princess Krell turned her eyes to the city just like I did.</p>
<p>While running, I confirmed it… the people living in the imperial capital were all lying on the ground just like the fallen magicians in the ‘Key Chamber,’ with vacant eyes. They seemed unconscious, and even when we passed by closely, there was no reaction. Everyone, including pedestrians walking on the streets, customers drinking at pubs, and people having meals at restaurants, were all in the same state.</p>
<p>By seeing that, it becomes easy to understand the reason for the black sphere’s existence.</p>
<p>“That black sphere is transmitting the ‘Discord’ throughout the entire capital. It disrupts the normal life force of people without resistance and takes their lives two hours later.”</p>
<p>“The timing of its appearance was probably when etoile’s key pierced the sphere.”</p>
<p>“Yes. If etoile’s key can use the vast amount of mana it contains, this kind of feat is possible. After all, etoile’s key is the Sixth heaven Key.”</p>
<p>If she fully utilizes the power of the Sixth heaven Key, she can use magic that affects the entire capital. While each key has its unique ability, etoile’s key possesses the power to become vicious depending on how it’s used. This is the result of Elne using it.</p>
<p>The most sinister magic that brings death to all living beings within a certain range.</p>
<p>A magic capable of slaughtering tens of thousands of humans at once, rivaling the power of the Seventh heaven Key.</p>
<p>However, to unleash such a large-scale power, one must pay a significant price and take time. Overall, it may not be as powerful as the Seventh heaven Key… but it’s still an incredibly formidable force.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Using that power, a rare large-scale massacre is currently underway, unveiling the secrets of history. It’s only natural to want to know the reason behind it.</p>
<p>“What Erne said about revenge, who or what is it directed towards…”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but it’s definitely not something trivial.”</p>
<p>To plot such a massive massacre implies holding deep grudges. Targeting the imperial capital means holding a strong grudge against the empire. For an individual to hate a whole nation, there must have been significant reasons.</p>
<p>Although I’m very curious, for now, we need to do something about that black sphere.</p>
<p>“Let’s get going soon.”</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ve rested for five minutes, so there’s no need to――”</p>
<p>Stopping my words, I reflexively snapped my fingers and created a transparent barrier behind us. A moment later, the blazing dull-colored flames collided with the barrier, scattering heat and sparks before vanishing. Mirage-like images were produced around the flames, but naturally, neither the heat nor the sparks reached us due to the barrier blocking them.</p>
<p>“Tch, as expected, it won’t reach  with this kind of magic.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I have no blind spots.”</p>
<p>After shaking my hand and making the barrier disappear, I glared coldly at the woman in front of us――Erne.</p>
<p>“I thought you would continue hiding, but did you come out in a hurry because you thought the black sphere would be destroyed? Either way, I planned to find you, so it saved me some trouble.”</p>
<p>“Really… it’s audacious to show up later and act so arrogantly. Anyway, I’ll be troubled if that black thing is destroyed.”</p>
<p>Wind Blade Storm!”</p>
<p>Erne covered her right hand, deployed a formation, and fired invisible blades of wind towards us.</p>
<p>Both precision and speed were passable.</p>
<p>It can be considered as a combat force worthy of a magician. However, it doesn’t come close to reaching me.</p>
<p>“Mirror Wall.”</p>
<p>Immediately after lightly shaking the Guardian Shield Key, a wall polished like a mirror appeared in front of us. The wind blades that hit the mirror, reflecting the reverse world, changed their direction by 180 degrees and approached Erne. Panicking to evade it, she released flaming arrows and ice arrows that scattered cold air, but they were all deflected and neutralized by the barrier.</p>
<p>No matter how much magic she uses, I can stop everything without moving an inch. My role is to protect Princess Krell, who is targeted by many, so I can’t be a failure as her escort. Besides, it’s essential not to allow third-rate magician’s magic to pass through.</p>
<p>After repeating meaningless magical attacks about a dozen times, Erne was left panting and kneeling with one knee on the ground.</p>
<p>“Haa… haa…”</p>
<p>“The excessive consumption of mana from forcing out the power of etoile’s key seems to have exhausted her considerably. Just a dozen shots, and she’s in this state.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that’s only natural. Even if she uses only the mana contained in etoile’s key to activate this magic affecting the entire imperial capital, the mana used to draw out that power must be significant. It’s only natural that she would be on the verge of collapse just from that, and yet she continued running and engaging in combat, further exhausting her mana. It seems that the mana contained in the Fifth heaven Key is reaching its limit.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Erne was suffering from an overwhelming sense of fatigue due to excessive mana consumption, and it appeared that she couldn’t move her body well. However, despite trembling all over and struggling to stand, Erne stared intensely at me.</p>
<p>“What… You have time to counterattack but choose only to defend. Are you waiting for me to run out of mana?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the case. I just have one thing I want to ask. I’ll leave you half-dead after hearing the answer… Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>Prompted by the master who had been observing the situation from behind, she responded with a nod and asked Erne.</p>
<p>“Erne-san… could you tell us? The reason why you’re trying to take the lives of the people in the imperial capital.”</p>
<p>“…I said it’s revenge, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But we don’t know the details of that revenge. That’s why… Roth.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Responding to the call, Princess Krell glared at me slightly and spoke.</p>
<p>“Why do you need to deploy the barrier right now?”</p>
<p>“Because Princess Krell, you were getting too close to her.”</p>
<p>I replied, averting my gaze.</p>
<p>Now, in front of her, there’s a transparent and thin, sturdy barrier. It’s not for defending against Erne’s attacks, but rather to prevent Princess Krell from getting any closer to Erne.</p>

<p>Princess Krell approached Erne, who was kneeling, and I couldn’t overlook the danger since she was defenseless against magic and could be caught off guard. I couldn’t ignore that risk.</p>
<p>But Princess Krell seemed dissatisfied.</p>
<p>“Remove the barrier immediately.”</p>
<p>“I can’t. It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay! If you’re so worried, then just stay by my side, Roth.”</p>
<p>“That’s not possible.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I would kill her.”</p>
<p>Princess Krell widened her eyes at my response, and I shot a glare filled with killing intent at Erne. She would surely sense how much I wanted to kill her right now.</p>
<p>“If I get close to that woman… I will undoubtedly grab her thin neck and snap it. I won’t even bother asking her about the reasons behind her charade.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She must have realized that I wasn’t lying or joking. Princess Krell held her breath, struggling to find words to say.</p>
<p>Then, Erne spoke in place of Princess Krell, who was struggling to respond.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I’ve been feeling your desire to kill me since earlier.”</p>
<p>“Quick on the uptake. I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“But, I wish you had removed the barrier.”</p>
<p>Erne placed a hand on her neck and smirked.</p>
<p>“Even with little remaining mana… I could still cut off that princess’s neck…”</p>
<p>Kill.</p>
<p>That thought, and I was already moving. With astonishing speed, I dashed, crushing the floor beneath me, and in less than a second, I closed in on Erne. I grabbed her neck with my right hand, firmly held it, and plunged the blade of the knife into her mouth. Blood stained the knife as it cut her mouth, but I ignored it and maintained my posture. I should be grateful that I didn’t cut her throat instantly.</p>
<p>“Ah… gah!”</p>
<p>“Stop it, Roth!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell shouted in a desperate voice to make me stop, but I tightened my grip on Erne’s neck.</p>
<p>“Should I cut off your tongue so you can never speak such insolence again?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps you prefer to have your head severed? Don’t worry; I can be called a pro when it comes to cutting people’s necks. I’ve practiced it hundreds of times.”</p>
<p>“Roth!”</p>
<p>Just as Princess Krell shouted my name again, I withdrew the sharp knife from Erne’s mouth and released the hand holding her neck. I had recently lost control and almost killed a waiter. I won’t repeat the same mistake twice.</p>
<p>“If you want to die, I’ll gladly oblige… but speak before you do. The ‘King’s’ desire is absolute. There’s no room for refusal.”</p>
<p>“Cough…”</p>
<p>Ignoring the coughing Erne, I bowed to Princess Krell.</p>
<p>“Now, if you will.”</p>
<p>“I thought you were really going to kill her…”</p>
<p>“You just scolded me, after all. I won’t make the same mistake twice. Words spoken by someone I love, I don’t forget.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell’s gaze glanced at the knife I held in my hand. It was the one I had put into Erne’s mouth, and the blade was stained with her blood and saliva.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“…Please throw that away quickly.”</p>
<p>“Princess Krell, I’m only interested in your bodily fluids.”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate it if you don’t say that out loud!”</p>
<p>Returning a smile to Princess Krell, who blushed, I quickly discarded the knife. I don’t want to use a knife covered in someone else’s bodily fluids, even if I wipe it. Luckily, I have plenty of knives in stock, so throwing away one or a hundred won’t be a problem. I regularly replenish them, anyway.</p>
<p>“Really…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell sighed.</p>
<p>“I also…”</p>
<p>Erne, lying on her back, murmured softly and began speaking.</p>
<p>“There was a time… when I lived happily with the person I loved, my beloved master.”</p>
<p>“Master, huh. In other words, the previous you served someone, just like me, as a servant.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Just like you, I was a follower to someone and… just like you, I fell in love with my master. Well, in my case, I had sworn a future with my master.”</p>
<p>Without making unnecessary interruptions, I moved silently closer to her, careful not to make any noise. Erne, still looking up at the sky, smiled as if reminiscing about that time. However, her eyes were covered by her arm, so I couldn’t see her exact expression.</p>
<p>From here on, it will be her monologue.</p>
<p>Deciding not to interrupt her words, I listened attentively to Erne’s story.</p>
<p>“I was a maid at the Earl Yuriel’s noble house in a small country called Safira Kingdom, located in the southwestern part of the Carreralonde Empire, until five years ago. It wasn’t very noble-like, considering it was a small territory with a small title.”</p>
<p>The Safira Kingdom is a small country with limited influence over its neighboring nations and weaker in terms of national strength compared to larger countries. On the other hand, it’s renowned for its abundant natural resources and has never experienced famine.</p>
<p>“I’ve been there once too. It’s a lush, green country, and everyone there is kind-hearted. It was a wonderful country where I spent happy days, and everyone at the estate got along well. Above all, being by the side of the person I loved, I had no complaints at all.”</p>
<p>“But you abandoned that content life and came to the Empire.”</p>
<p>A living environment without complaints is not something one would readily give up. However, Erne left her beloved master’s side and became a museum researcher in the Carreralonde Empire.</p>
<p>There must be some special reason behind it.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“I didn’t abandon it… it had it taken away from me. This country… we had a happy nation.”</p>



<p>“Taken away?”</p>



<p>Princess Krell looked our way, but I shook my head.</p>



<p>I’ve never heard of such a thing. There’s no historical record of the Empire invading the Safira Kingdom. Historically, these two countries had little interaction. That’s still the case today, and they haven’t formed any alliances. Yet, there was a genuine hatred in Erne’s voice.</p>



<p>“Even the royals don’t know… I’m sure only a few people in the Empire are aware. The underhanded and vile things the Carreralonde Empire is doing to the Safira Kingdom. Now… that country has become nothing more than a puppet state for the grand Empire.”</p>



<p>“So, the Empire’s upper echelons are invading the Safira Kingdom using methods other than military force?”</p>



<p>It’s a typical method of aggression used by large countries against smaller ones.</p>



<p>There are various methods, like making enticing offers to the small country’s nobles and passing legislation in the parliament that benefits the large country in exchange. Gradually, the small country becomes more aligned with the interests of the large country, eventually turning into a full-fledged puppet state. Publicly, they might be referred to as a subordinate state.</p>



<p>However, there’s something I don’t understand.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to comprehend that the Empire would keep such an invasion hidden from its citizens. Normally, such an achievement by the Empire’s government would be loudly proclaimed to the citizens.”</p>



<p>Even for a small country, turning another nation into a puppet state would be a significant achievement. It would be an excellent opportunity for the Empire’s government to showcase its competence to the citizens. So, how is it possible that even the citizens, let alone Princess Krell, are unaware of this…? What’s going on?</p>



<p>When I asked Erne, she said with contempt:</p>



<p>“The government won’t say anything to its citizens… They are doing something that would cause resentment. I’m sure they only share it with a select few in the Empire. They’re doing cowardly and despicable things to the Safira Kingdom that can’t be made public.”</p>



<p>“Eugenics…”</p>



<p>As I thought of a possibility, Erne nodded.</p>



<p>I see. So that’s what’s happening. It appears the government of this country is thoroughly rotten.</p>



<p>“Roth, eugenics means…”</p>



<p>“In short, the Empire’s government is insane. Anyone in the Safira Kingdom who dares to oppose the Empire’s orders is killed. Likely… even her master… that must have been the case, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes, you caught on quickly. I appreciate it.”</p>



<p>I sympathized with her a little. At the same time, I understood the reason behind Erne’s intense desire for revenge against the Empire.</p>



<p>“My master, Lord Rias, directly opposed the tax increase ordered by the Empire. Lord Rias did everything to protect the livelihood of the people. But it was futile. Four days after submitting dissenting document, Lord Rias, along with all the estate’s servants, was killed by assassins.”</p>



<p>Before I knew it, tears were flowing from Erne’s eyes. What emotions were they carrying? Anger, sadness, regret… or perhaps all of them? I couldn’t discern them.</p>



<p>“Lord Rias… even with only one arm left, let me escape. And then said we wouldn’t meet again… and couldn’t live anymore, so I should be the one to escape. I couldn’t forgive for trying to leave me behind alone… but there was no other choice. I still dream about Lord Rias face, just out of reach… It’s more painful, lonely, and sad than anything I’ve ever felt. That’s why I’ve been living with the sole purpose of seeking revenge on everyone in this country who took away my precious people.”</p>



<p>“So, you decided on revenge.”</p>



<p>“…Yes! That’s right!!”</p>



<p>Erne’s voice echoed.</p>



<p>“That talk about it only being the Empire’s upper echelons, and the citizens having no involvement… it doesn’t hold up! A country is made up of its people! Every person in the Empire constitutes the essence of the country itself! That’s why I’ve vowed to exact revenge on every single person in the Empire, regardless of their status, gender, or anything else! I’ve lived with that purpose up to today!”</p>



<p>“Erne-san…”</p>



<p>“This flame of vengeance is all I have left!” I don’t need to harbor any sympathy. I don’t need to direct any fake feelings of pity, thinking “oh how sad.” What I want isn’t sympathy, but time! So don’t get in my way! This is my final loyalty and love dedicated to Lady Rias!”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>The moment I heard Erne’s scream, something snapped inside me. It was like a string that had been pulled taut suddenly cut loose.</p>



<p>“Love, you say?” I murmured, then slapped Erne hard across the cheek. More of a punch than a slap. Erne rolled to the side from the force of my open-handed blow, grabbing her cheek as she pushed herself up.</p>



<p>“W-what?” She looked at me in bewilderment. I stepped closer and grabbed her by the collar.</p>



<p>I understood her grief and despair as a loyal attendant who had just lost her mistress before her eyes. If I were in her position… If I lost Princess Krell right in front of me, I might also choose to slaughter everyone from the nation responsible.</p>



<p>However, as a fellow attendant, there was something I just couldn’t let slide.</p>



<p>“Erne, did your lord… did Lord Rias tell you to take revenge on the empire?”</p>



<p>“That’s…”</p>



<p>“I doubt it. From what you’ve said, a person who devoted to protecting the people would not entrust you with revenge . The wordsleft with you, the beloved, would not be a curse bidding you to take vengeance… but a wish for your happiness. Am I wrong?”</p>



<p>“…!”</p>



<p>Erne’s eyes widened, then gradually filled with tears… which overflowed and trickled down her cheeks.</p>



<p>Confident I was right, I took the silver ring from my pocket and tossed it to Erne.</p>



<p>“This is…!”</p>



<p>“It’s yours isn’t it? I’m returning it.”</p>



<p>Erne looked at the object in her hand with surprise and bewilderment.</p>



<p>The ring I had thrown was the one that had been on the pigeon’s foot when Princess Krell and I encountered it during our walk. It was simple without any lavish decorations or jewels. At the time, I assumed it had been placed on the pigeon for some recently trendy love ritual… but now with everything cleared up, I realized my thinking had been mistaken.</p>



<p>“When sharing senses with a familiar, the spellcaster must provide the familiar with an object deeply connected to them. That ring you always wore on your left ring finger… it must have been a gift from the lord you loved.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>Erne said nothing and kept her eyes fixed on the ring. Taking her silence as affirmation, I continued.</p>



<p>“The hatred and desire for revenge you feel toward someone who stole your precious person are tremendously strong and difficult for others to comprehend. In fact, you were willing to cast aside everything dear to you in order to exact revenge. I sympathize with what you and the others have gone through, and I understand the feeling of wanting vengeance…”</p>



<p>“Then—”</p>



<p>“However,” I interjected sharply, glaring straight at Erne. “I cannot agree with or sympathize with such unbecoming behavior for a servant who ignores her master’s final command.”</p>



<p>“—!”</p>



<p>Erne gasped, a tear trailing down her cheek as I gripped her collar and raised my voice.</p>



<p>“Remember! Did your lord want you to take revenge? Were the final words meant to curse you with misfortune? Was Lord Rias such a wretched person?”</p>



<p>“N-no—”</p>



<p>“Then this vengeance you offer is merely self-satisfaction. Loyalty and love against your lord’s wishes are useless foolishness. As one who serves, fulfill your lord’s desires! Especially if you loved Lord Rias as a woman. If your lord wished for you to find happiness, then strive to be happy. The joy you attain through effort will be the greatest offering to your departed lord.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>



<p>“You have strayed from the right path. But there is still time to return to it.”</p>



<p>By the time I finished speaking, Erne had given up trying to hold back her tears. She looked up at the sky as tears poured down, crying out loudly without restraint. Her tearful wails echoed through the silent streets where people had fallen quiet.</p>



<p>I turned my eyes away from Erne.</p>



<p>I no longer felt anger toward her. She too was a victim, a pitiful victim of the disaster brought about by rotten people.</p>



<p>Of course, her sins do not disappear. Attempting to assassinate Princess Krell, trying to steal the etoile gate key, seeking to harm the citizens of the capital… She will have to atone for these sins all her life.</p>



<p>But the rotten imperial government is also to blame for her sins. It would be unfair to punish only Erne while letting those bastards off scot-free. The root cause must be thoroughly crushed, or else this tragedy will repeat. If all the people of the capital end up dead, there can be no justice for these sins. That cannot happen. The saying “a nation is its people” is apt – it would be unconscionable for innocent people unrelated to this to die.</p>



<p>Therefore, let us fulfill our original goal.</p>



<p>“Princess Krell, shall we go?”</p>



<p>“Is it alright?”</p>



<p>“If we stay here, the time limit will just creep closer. There’s less than an hour left. Let’s hurry. And Erne—”</p>



<p>Still carrying Princess Krell, I called out to the sobbing Erne.</p>



<p>“You stay here. I’ll at least clean up the aftermath for you.”</p>



<p>Leaving those parting words, I broke into a run,</p>



<p>Toward the sphere below spewing sinister black miasma.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later.</p>
<p>“It feels bigger up close than it looked from afar,” said Princess Krell as we arrived on a rooftop several hundred meters from the black sphere. Despite her words, she seemed completely unfazed.</p>
<p>I floated my Guardian Shield key in the air and took off my necktie, tossing it away. She was right, it did feel far larger up close.</p>
<p>“The diameter looks to be around 300 meters. Black miasma has started leaking from the surface over time, so shall we hurry and destroy it?”</p>
<p>“I understand that, but… will it really be alright?”</p>
<p>Princess Krell asked worriedly as she looked at the collapsed people below.</p>
<p>All the people we passed on our way here were unconscious, affected by this sphere. Not a single person still retained normal awareness. Perhaps the mages of the 6th gate key at the imperial palace might be fine like us, but there was no point in going there now, nor did we have any obligation to check on them. The fact that they hadn’t made any moves to deal with this despite the capital’s condition made their incompetence obvious anyway. I would keep my contempt of them to myself.</p>
<p>Now, what Princess Krell was worried about was…</p>
<p>“If my magic flattens the capital…”</p>
<p>“It will be fine, so go all out,” I assured her.</p>
<p>Indeed, if Princess Krell alone unleashed her magic, the capital would become a flat expanse of nothing, and the aftershocks would shatter windows in houses in neighboring countries. Her spells disregarded collateral damage, focusing everything on destructive power. And the nature of her gate key itself specialized in offensive magic. It could rightly be called the ultimate spear.</p>
<p>If she alone handled the sphere, the capital’s people might be spared a weakening death, but they would be annihilated without a trace.</p>
<p>I was here to avert such a ludicrous outcome.</p>
<p>Thrusting out my Guardian Shield key, I chanted a spell.</p>
<p>“Rainbow King’s Shield.”</p>
<p>In the instant a small magic circle appeared at the tip of the gate key—</p>
<p>A rainbow aurora enveloped the entire capital.</p>
<p>The seven-colored curtain covering the sky glowed faintly, shrouding everything in the capital. It could hardly be called a shield. In fact, the aurora offered no defense whatsoever against physical attacks.</p>
<p>But the Rainbow King’s Shield boasted absolute defense against magical attacks. It would become the ultimate shield to protect its master.</p>
<p>“Beautiful…” said Princess Krell, gazing at the spectrum of light overhead. This was no time for idle viewing.</p>
<p>“Now, Princess Krell.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>At my prompt, Princess Krell placed a hand on her chest, took a deep breath, and—</p>
<p>“Falling Star God Key.”</p>
<p>She manifested a single, massive gate key that shone golden with hints of red.</p>
<p>Wrapped in golden miasma, its mere presence shook the air. It was the exact same size as my Guardian Shield, but one glance conveyed the difference in class. The ultimate armament that makes a ‘King’ a King, conferring supremacy over all things unconditionally.</p>
<p>The reason everyone regarded Krell Carreralonde with fear and awe.</p>
<p>That was the gate key she wielded—Falling Star God Key.</p>
<p>Holding the rank of 7th, it was a bona fide strongest gate key.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll be making use of it. Roth.”</p>
<p>“The Falling Star God Key already belongs to you, not me. There’s no need to ask permission.”</p>
<p>At my words, Princess Krell shook her head.</p>
<p>“Even now, this belongs to Roth. I’m merely borrowing it and being allowed to use it.”</p>
<p>“As stubborn as ever… Very well, go ahead and use it as you please.”</p>
<p>I gave a wry smile and spoke dismissively.</p>
<p>That’s right. The Falling Star God Key originally belonged to me. On the day I met Princess Krell and decided to serve as her attendant, I entrusted it to her when she had no power of her own. So that no one would ever mistreat and abuse her again.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Roth.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, without looking at me, Princess Krell apologized as she held the Falling Star God Key overhead.</p>
<p>“I’m useless without borrowing your power. A hopeless lord.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>What’s with the sudden apology?</p>
<p>Princess Krell is an incompetent, useless young lady who would have trouble living on her own. I understood that from the day we first met, and even knowing that, I—we—love and serve her.</p>
<p>I take pride in being her attendant and find joy in supporting this bumbling young lady. There is no need for apologies.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say I would make up for all your flaws? Instead of apologizing, please rely on me fully. I will bear it all.”</p>
<p>Princess Krell did not respond to my words. She simply smiled faintly—</p>
<p>“Meteor.”</p>
<p>—and chanted the spell of destruction to save the capital.</p>
<p>At the tip of the Falling Star God Key, a bizarre, intricate magic circle deployed, dense red mana saturating the surroundings. Occasional vermilion lightning flashed, booming sounds piercing the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Glancing skyward, an identical magic circle hovered overhead, illuminating the capital with dozens of times the radiance of moonlight.</p>
<p>I stared fixedly at the magic circle in the night sky, realizing—</p>
<p>“Here it comes.”</p>
<p>—that the embodiment of destruction was hurtling down from the heavens toward the earth.</p>
<p>Its speed exceeded sound, its mass rivaling the floating black sphere. If they collided… the capital would be obliterated without a trace, leaving only an unnatural crater in the wide wilderness.</p>
<p>The spell known as Meteor, synonymous with the Falling Star God Key, literally calls down a massive meteorite from high in the sky to crash into its target. Its destructive power needs no further testimony, easily destroying the black sphere.</p>
<p>Perhaps a bit overkill, though.</p>
<p>The falling meteorite approached the black sphere at breakneck speed, generating shockwaves—the moment it made contact, the massive meteorite exploded tremendously, whitening the entire field of view. Shockwaves, blast waves, heat rays… in an instant, the sky transformed into hell.</p>
<p>However, despite the meteorite’s deadly detonation overhead, no harm came to the capital’s people, buildings, or anything else.</p>
<p>My active Rainbow King’s Shield was an absolute defense that protected its target from any phenomenon caused by magic. The shockwaves, gales, and heat rays were all products of Princess Krell’s Meteor spell. Therefore, the seven-colored aurora blocked it all.</p>
<p>About ten seconds later, the reddened sky returned to its original dark hue, the twinkling stars and moon restoring the peaceful night. The black sphere that took a direct hit from the meteorite vanished without a trace, not leaving behind even a shadow or shape.</p>
<p>The sinister orb that brought death was completely erased.</p>
<p>Confirming this, I dismissed the rainbow aurora and made the Guardian Shield key disappear into the void, my shoulders sagging from the fatigue that had crept up on me. Princess Krell lowered the Falling Star God Key and walked over to me, looking far livelier than I did in contrast.</p>
<p>“You have a tired face, how unusual.”</p>
<p>“And whose fault do you think that is? Honestly, you need to learn some restraint. That was clearly too powerful.”</p>
<p>“But you’re the one who said you’d take it all! I—”</p>
<p>“Just because I said that doesn’t mean you should indiscriminately turn the capital and surrounding area into scorched earth. Is there anyone who would unleash magic to casually flatten everything for kilometers around? Princess Krell still has a long way to go…”</p>
<p>“…Roth?”</p>
<p>I had stopped mid-sentence, prompting Princess Krell to tilt her head curiously.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“The civilians aren’t waking up.”</p>
<p>The black sphere had definitely been destroyed. Yet the people collapsed all over the capital showed no signs of getting back up. They remained facedown, seated, eyes vacant—not a single person moved even slightly, like lifeless ragdolls.</p>
<p>Could they already be dead?</p>
<p>The thought crossed my mind, but that couldn’t be. If they were dead, I who was also affected by the ‘disorder’ would be dead too.</p>
<p>Looking down below with me, Princess Krell said puzzledly:</p>
<p>“What do you mean? We destroyed the black sphere, so…”</p>
<p>“…There’s a possibility that comes to mind.”</p>
<p>I relayed to Princess Krell the likelihood that had occurred to me.</p>
<p>“In other words, even if we destroy that black sphere, the effects of the magic will remain active once it’s been activated?”</p>
<p>The quality was extremely poor, but such magic did exist in reality. Magic that persists even after the caster’s death if activated beforehand—truly troublesome. As a famous example, war magic from the world war several centuries ago which was buried underground to detonate when enemy soldiers walked over it… Something like landmine arrays, I believe?</p>
<p>The arrays and their effects continue even after the mage who placed them dies, so casualties from unexploded arrays still occur all over the world today. Extremely bothersome magic.</p>
<p>…No, since landmine arrays can be dealt with if you find their locations, I guess they’re still better than this situation in the capital. After all, there’s no way to address what’s happening in the capital now. No magic exists in this world that can save tens of thousands of people at once within the few remaining hours.</p>
<p>The situation was hopeless.</p>
<p>There was no way to change the present circumstances—the future where the capital’s people and I died was now certain.</p>
<p>The only thing left to do was spend the remaining time until the approaching deadline conveying my love and farewell to Princess Krell. She would probably accept my feelings in this situation. It might not be so bad to be seen off by my beloved.</p>
<p>As I thought that, I heaved a deep sigh—careful not to look at Princess Krell next to me from whom I sensed an intense gaze—and asked:</p>
<p>“Why are your eyes shining so brightly, Third Princess Krell Carreralonde? Does my assured death bring you joy?”</p>
<p>“Let me ask you in return, Roth. Don’t you think nothing short of a miraculous power can overturn your impending demise?”</p>
<p>“…What are you trying to say?”</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>No, I understood. What Princess Krell was getting at, I understood better than anyone. In fact, that there was no other way to change the present circumstances, and that we were in a state where we could use ‘that’—I knew it all.</p>



<p>Yet I didn’t want to acknowledge it. I didn’t want to admit that was the only possibility.</p>



<p>But reality was merciless.</p>



<p>Princess Krell spoke cheerfully:</p>



<p>“The deadline is approaching. There’s no way to save the capital’s people…to save you. We can’t do anything more—it’s a hopeless situation. When people are in a bind like this, they all think the same thing. ‘Help me, God!’ Right?!”</p>



<p>“I refuse.”</p>



<p>I rejected her at lightspeed.</p>



<p>I knew that was the only way, but I still hated it. Even understanding I served Princess Krell and absolute obedience to my lord was expected, I had the right to dislike what I disliked. Even as a servant I could refuse! That was my stance, but this time Princess Krell seemed unwilling to give up easily either. Circling around to my front, she grabbed both my wrists with her hands.</p>



<p>“Roth, listen. If we don’t take action, you along with the capital’s people will die. Then you’ll never be able to see me again, and I’ll never be able to see you either. Our happy days together that we’ve spent as a matter of course until now will disappear. Isn’t that awful?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Awful.”</p>



<p>“Then—”</p>



<p>Princess Krell showed me a beaming smile, like a fully bloomed flower. In contrast, I said emotionlessly:</p>



<p>“In exchange, you want me to take that form?”</p>



<p>“It can’t be helped for the sake of helping so many! A-and… I really, really love that form of yours! It’s just the best!”</p>



<p>“I see. That’s why I hate it.”</p>



<p>I recoiled a bit from Princess Krell, whose breathing had grown slightly ragged. Pardon me, but could you wipe off your drool, my lady? How unseemly.</p>



<p>…This is bad.</p>



<p>Once Princess Krell forgets herself like this and acts less maidenly, she becomes completely unyielding. She’ll stubbornly continue her verbal barrage until I give in. Having experienced it multiple times, I knew. Troubling as it was, this princess was quite stubborn.</p>



<p>But unconditional obedience was undesirable. If I had to endure unpleasantness, Princess Krell would have to properly compensate me in turn.</p>



<p>Ahh…so it’s the usual pattern again, I see.</p>



<p>“I understand,” I said listlessly, with a somewhat wicked tone.</p>



<p>“As you say, if we do nothing, I’ll die and be unable to see your face again—I want to avoid that too.”</p>



<p>“Then—!”</p>



<p>“However,”</p>



<p>I interjected, raising a finger and declaring,</p>



<p>“You are forbidden from touching me in that form.”</p>



<p>“—!”</p>



<p>Princess Krell made a face like the world was ending. Then she wobbled her body left and right several times, approached me with staggering steps, and gripped both my shoulders tightly.</p>



<p>“Why…? Why would you say something so cruel…?”</p>



<p>“Because otherwise you’ll try to hug me until the time limit, it seems.”</p>



<p>“I won’t! At most…maybe two hours!”</p>



<p>“That’s far too long. We’re facing mortal peril here, so show some more tension. Honestly…”</p>



<p>Was this really an appropriate mood when we bore the lives of tens of thousands?</p>



<p>I wondered, as I summoned my Guardian Shield key and held it out before me.</p>



<p>Then—I twisted it a hundred and eighty degrees counterclockwise, which it could not do while closed.</p>



<p>The sound of something unlocking rang out, and at the same moment, the Guardian Shield key dissipated into particles of light, transforming into a pure silver padlock connecting four chains. Reflecting the moon and starlight, it shone brilliantly without the slightest tarnish.</p>



<p>Ugh, I hate this.</p>



<p>Hatred surged through me to the point of voicing it, but Princess Krell paid my feelings no mind, eagerly bringing her Falling Star God Key near the padlock. Unlike me, she seemed extremely happy. I wanted to slap her.</p>



<p>“Well then, shall we go?”</p>



<p>“Yes, do as you please.”</p>



<p>At my dismissive words, Princess Krell inserted one of her gate keys into the padlock—and unlocked it.</p>



<p>In that instant, the four chains shattered and disappeared, and Princess Krell and I were enveloped in white light. My body grew hot. I felt a strange sensation like I was being remade into a different existence. No, that feeling wasn’t exactly mistaken. My body really was being transformed.</p>



<p>It seemed to take around ten seconds.</p>



<p>The light and heat enveloping my whole body faded, and my vision cleared.</p>



<p>The first thing that came into view was Princess Krell’s form, different from earlier.</p>



<p>Her long, pale blue hair had changed into pure white, and her eyes now harbored an otherworldly allure in faint purple. A pair of wings of light sprouted from her back, and a ring of radiance floated above her head.</p>



<p>Anyone who saw Princess Krell’s current appearance would unanimously describe her as an angel. While beautiful normally, this form had a different charm.</p>



<p>It was captivating beyond words. The moment our eyes met, Princess Krell—who was emanating such entrancing beauty—charged at full speed and embraced me tightly. It was painful.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/023dc4f9-3e77-4a36-a4d6-57d21adec927_00004.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“‘Ahhhh!! This is it, this form! It’s just so cute…I could eat you up!”</p>



<p>“Didn’t I say no touching?”</p>



<p>She was speaking in a high, childlike voice, but it seemed Princess Krell wasn’t listening to me at all. Like a child given a long-awaited toy, she was absorbed in hugging me tightly.</p>



<p>Disgusting.</p>



<p>While being fondled to Princess Krell’s heart’s content in her arms, I flicked my seven fox tails growing from my tailbone and the large ears on my head to protest and knock against her. But that had the opposite effect, only making her hold me tighter.</p>



<p>Damn it, this is why I didn’t want to take this form… Once transformed, I have to stay like this for an hour.</p>



<p>With a sigh, I turned my body into particles of light and slipped out of Princess Krell’s grasp, moving a short distance away. I materialized there.</p>



<p>“Princess Krell. Right now we should be saving the capital’s people, not fawning over me. Please don’t lose sight of our goal.”</p>



<p>“But…!”</p>



<p>Looking reluctant, Princess Krell took a hand mirror from her pocket—why was she carrying that around—and held it up toward me.</p>



<p>“When there’s a cute beast boy with animal ears and a tail, you just have to dote on him! It’s instinctive!”</p>



<p>“Please don’t have such eccentric instincts.”</p>



<p>clicking my tongue, I looked at my reflection in Princess Krell’s mirror.</p>



<p>Silver hair, a small childlike stature maybe around ten years old. I had large fox ears and seven tails like the mythical fox spirits of folklore. Rather than looking gallant, I gave a weak impression, so I didn’t really like this form… But Princess Krell seemed to love me like this, pouncing and hugging me tightly as she was now. I hated it a lot. Being treated like a child irritated me to no end.</p>



<p>“Stop saying foolish things and hurry up and save the people. I’ll die too at this rate.”</p>



<p>“But…just a little longer…”</p>



<p>Snap.</p>



<p>I instantly froze the surrounding area and smiled at Princess Krell, radiating anger.</p>
<p>“Did you say something?”</p>
<p>“N-no, nothing…”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>I dispelled the freeze and floated over to the Falling Star God Key in Princess Krell’s hand—and kissed its tip.</p>
<p>In that moment, a massive magic circle deployed above our heads. An intricate gold-glowing array seemed poised and ready, slowly rotating as if anticipating the chance to take effect.</p>
<p>No need to rush, I’ll have it unleash its power soon enough.</p>
<p>Muttering inwardly, I turned to face Princess Krell.</p>
<p>“Now then, Princess Krell. What is your wish…?”</p>
<p>“U-um…you won’t get mad if I say it…right?”</p>
<p>“That depends on the content… Go ahead and tell me.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell’s gaze wandered as she murmured softly:</p>
<p>“Your expression when you kissed the key just now…it was nice~”</p>
<p>“It seems Princess Krell’s mind is quite impure.”</p>
<p>I held my forehead and shook my head left and right.</p>
<p>The moment I take this form, she starts seeking me as if I’m a different person. If that’s the case, I wish she would desire me this much in my normal state too.</p>
<p>It was utterly vexing…but scolding her all the time would be sad. I hated it, but she seemed to like me like this.</p>
<p>Oh well. I supposed I could give her a little treat.</p>
<p>I brought my mouth near Princess Krell’s ear.</p>
<p>“Focus on what we need to do now. When we’re done…I’ll give it to you.”</p>
<p>“…Understood.”</p>
<p>Humans were so simple, loyal to their desires—the mere prospect of a reward drastically boosted her motivation. Of course, I fell within that spectrum too.</p>
<p>As I looked at Princess Krell with an exasperated smile, she closed her eyes, silently voiced her wish in her heart, then spoke the name of the spell.</p>
<p>“Wish Granting.”</p>
<p>In that moment, golden light shone from the tip of Princess Krell’s Falling Star God Key, and the magic circle overhead responded with a dazzling radiance.</p>
<p>The golden brilliance illuminating the capital was unsuited for the quiet night when people slumbered. Eventually it converged to a single point—in a flash, the concentrated light burst, scattering golden particles into the capital’s sky.</p>
<p>Dancing in the air, drifting down onto the night capital, it was like golden snow.</p>
<p>The golden powder snow fell obeying gravity, blown by the wind, disappearing as it melted upon touching the ground. Embodying the principle that all things, no matter how gloriously they reign, eventually decline—it was like watching the vicissitudes of the world.</p>
<p>As I watched, enthralled by the fantastical spectacle, Princess Krell dispelled the magic circle and approached, embracing me from behind while I floated. Why must you hug me?</p>
<p>I shot her a look of protest, but Princess Krell paid it no mind and asked:</p>
<p>“How are the capital’s people?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. The wish was granted successfully.”</p>
<p>As I replied, I felt the physical unease from the ‘disorder’ disappear.</p>
<p>With the magic’s effects gone, the people living in the capital would soon open their eyes. Things should return to normal peaceful daily life.</p>
<p>“Oh good… Really…”</p>
<p>Princess Krell heaved a deep sigh of relief from the bottom of her heart. No longer in the angelic form from earlier, she had reverted to her original appearance. I wondered why she could change back immediately while I had to stay a fox spirit for a while. It was far too unequal.</p>
<p>As I inwardly protested to God or whatever, Princess Krell pinched one of my tails between her fingers.</p>
<p>“With this, our recent difficult days have finally come to an end.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my difficult days are over.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I really had gone through a lot recently.</p>
<p>After taking on the museum director’s request, I had instructed him on what to do, taken Princess Krell’s verbal poison in her place at the cost of my life, pieced together Erne’s identity from the circumstances, evidence, and her words… And now I had ended up saving all the citizens of the capital along with my own life. Beyond the monthly wages, I deserved additional compensation for working this hard. Specifically, I wanted Princess Krell’s love.</p>
<p>“Particularly in this incident, without me, tens of thousands would certainly have died. By rights, I should get a medal directly from the Emperor for my achievements.”</p>
<p>“Do you want one?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t accept it even if I died. Besides, the power to unlock the heavens is our secret.”</p>
<p>As I said this, I placed a finger to my lips.</p>
<p>The final magic that saved the capital’s people—Wish Granting—was power surpassing that of the 7th gate key. By unlocking the seal on the Guardian Shield key with a 7th gate key, one could use this magic. Its effect was literally to fulfill the caster’s wish—an absurd power that even exceeded the principles of this world.</p>
<p>Of course, it couldn’t grant just any wish. To use this magic required massive mana consumption, so there was a limit to the wish one mage could fulfill. Something like immortality was absolutely impossible. It could not make real a wish that defied the world’s principle of impermanence.</p>
<p>Additionally, it could not be activated easily anytime.</p>
<p>The timing when this power could be used was—when I was consigned to an inescapable death.</p>
<p>Only when in a hopeless situation beyond my power, simply awaiting death, could the seal first appear. In other words, Wish Granting was a magic to avert my demise. If I hadn’t been affected by the ‘disorder’ in this incident… the capital would have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Oh, and I had absolutely no idea why I became a fox spirit. This was the one thing I seriously suspected was God or whatever messing with me out of spite.</p>
<p>“I see…a secret between just the two of us, indeed.”</p>
<p>“Yes. If it became known, war would break out.”</p>
<p>While the activation requirements were harsh, if the existence of a power capable of granting wishes became public, war would undoubtedly occur. Humans covered in greed would scramble fiercely for the right to fulfill their desires through conflict. However much one speaks of reason and such, humans are animals—they cannot resist the instinct to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>And to gain the power to grant wishes, millions would shed their blood, staining the land. Both Princess Krell and I hoped to avoid such a sorrowful outcome.</p>
<p>As the people of the capital gradually began waking up, I urged Princess Krell that we should return home.</p>
<p>“Well then, shall we head back? The townspeople are starting to get up too.”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, I’m exhausted as well, though not like Roth… Ah, but will the museum be okay? I’m sure it’s in chaos.”</p>
<p>“Before leaving the museum, I left instructions on what the director should do next in a memo by his side, so there’s no problem.”</p>
<p>“As expected of you…”</p>
<p>“Naturally, I am a butler.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that reminds me—”</p>
<p>Still speaking, I drew close and kissed Princess Krell’s forehead, interrupting her “Huh, wha—”. For a moment she didn’t comprehend what had happened, then slowly flushed red, hand on the spot my lips had touched.</p>
<p>Our young lady really was easy to tease.</p>
<p>Thinking that, I peered intently into her eyes at close range. With a finger to my lips and a mischievous smile, I said:</p>
<p>“It was a promise that I would give it to you when we finished. You did very well.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Princess Krell, whose mouth opened and closed like a gasping fish, eventually bowed her head without responding. Face completely red, she covered her unseemly mouth to hide it from me.</p>
<p>I would let the issue of her treating me like a child slide with this.</p>
<p>I floated next to my mute master and matched her pace as we headed home.</p>
<p>Thoroughly savoring the sense of fulfillment filling my chest.</p>
