<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5 V: Eternal Love</h1>

<p class="calibre5">It was the next day, at school before the morning homeroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With Golden Week starting next week, the students were all in high spirits.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since today was Friday, after the weekend, we just had to attend school on Monday and Tuesday, then we would be off for five consecutive days.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The students in sports clubs were chatting about their trips, while others were excited about their holiday plans.</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, my own heart was far from calm.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari had declared our friendship over, and a night had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After that, she called Hibari-san to pick her up, and she left quickly by car, not listening to anything I said.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As a result, I had to call Sakunee-san and ask her to bring me the money for the Kandagawa payment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought she would be furious, but seeing me covered in Calpis because of Himari, she burst out laughing and was in a surprisingly good mood… Of course, my two Nee-san who had married off were also informed via LINE.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Speaking of LINE, Himari has been ignoring all my messages since last night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even at school, she wouldn’t speak to me at all. Our seats being next to each other only added to the awkwardness.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It seems she was serious about ending our friendship.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t understand. Why?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There are so many things I don’t understand. What is she dissatisfied with?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, judging from the flow of the conversation, it must be about becoming Enomoto-san’s exclusive model.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But why does she need to hate it so much? The three of us were in sync during the work, and we actually got along well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And to declare the end of our friendship… What are you, a grade-schooler?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thinking about it makes me angry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why do I have to be treated like the bad guy? Right? Did I do something wrong?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I sipped on my Yoguruppe. It was one I bought from the vending machine this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I happened to glance next to me, and my eyes met with Himari’s.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She was also sipping on her Yoguruppe.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari flashed a wide smile at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was as if she was saying, ‘Nfufu~. Even if I say we’re through, you’re too concerned about cute little me, huh? Yuu, you really like me, don’t you?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I admit she’s cute, but does she realize there’s a big boomerang sticking out of the back of her head?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Hmph.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If that’s how it’s going to be, I have my own ways of dealing with it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Specifically, the techniques I’ve learned from Enomoto-san in these past few weeks.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pulled a small packet of snacks from my bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a new product from our convenience store, a super spicy habanero snack.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I bit into one, crunching it loudly, and then the spiciness hit me sharply.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But washed down with the Yoguruppe, the lactic acid sweetness is even more apparent.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah~, this is so good~.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But I don’t know, I might not be able to finish it alone. I wish someone would eat for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Heh. She’s wavering.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I always end up on the receiving end, so I have to show my mental superiority at times like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, I haven’t done anything wrong. It was Enomoto-san’s own decision to become a model, not because I persuaded her.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Directing her anger at me is completely wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Above all, I feel the subtle gap in Himari’s heart when she reads my LINE messages within three seconds despite having declared the end of our friendship.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With that state of mind, how could she say such a thing?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I could hear the boys in my class talking.</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Aren’t those two unusually quiet today?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No way, they’re totally flirting.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t look too much, or you’ll become material for their new ‘play’.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Stop it, I can hear you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I cleared my throat with a ‘cough.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, she really intends to ignore me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s so childish. I threw the snack packet onto the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The paper pack of Yoguruppe made a slurping sound, and then I crushed the now empty pack in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fine then. It’s over between us, including our plan to start up a specialty shop together.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For a moment, Himari’s complexion changed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">About to say something, she opens her mouth but ultimately remains silent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a strangely sad expression, she flops down onto the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The gazes of the students around us are piercing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…No, I get it. From the outside, it definitely looks like I’m the one bullying her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At times like this, Himari’s magic is a blessing. No one would think that Himari is throwing a fit and causing trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(…Well, things will go back to normal soon enough. Even best friends fight sometimes.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I looked outside the window. On the horizon, the blue sea of Hyuga-nada was spreading out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s another beautiful day. Perfect weather for flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like skipping school and going to buy bulbs and planters at the flower shop.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I want to sweat outside and forget these gloomy feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">──Vrrt, the vibration of a phone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s my smartphone. A notification?</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I check it, it’s from Himari. Looks like she’s finally giving up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My habanero rationing strategy must have worked.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, now we can finally talk.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What? It’s an email, not a LINE message.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s unusual, and the content is unusually long.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The wording is kind of formal, too… Hmm?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…A forwarded email for Himari?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">『To Ms. Himari Inuzuka. Thank you for contacting us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I am with the talent agency of&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">We sincerely thank you for your reply and favorable response. We would like to proceed immediately with&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;We will contact you shortly with the specific details.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Depending on how things go&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;by the end of May, we may be able to arrange for you the procedures for transferring to this high school…』</p>

<p class="calibre5">(What is this…?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Could this be the email from the talent agency that Himari said she turned down before?</p>
<p class="calibre5">A favorable response…</p>
<p class="calibre5">When was this email sent? It was last night…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just after she declared the end of our friendship to me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait, Himari!? What does this mean!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stood up impulsively on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I got up with so much force that the chair hit the desk behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The loud noise caused the classroom to fall completely silent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari’s head moved towards me. Through the gap in her arms, her marine blue eyes peeked out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Pfft.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari flashed a broad grin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s as if she’s saying, “You thought I’d forgive you right away, didn’t you? If you’re going to apologize, now’s your only chance~.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“~~~~!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, damn!</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s really annoying!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, you…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">At that moment, our homeroom teacher arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing the atmosphere in the classroom, he frowned.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Natsume. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“… It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just then, the bell for morning homeroom rang. As I picked up my chair to sit, my classmates also returned to their seats.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After that, Himari seriously didn’t say a word to me.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">The bell for the start of lunch break rang.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">As Himari stood up, she left the classroom with the speed of a whirlwind.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because I was taking out my convenience store bread for lunch from my bag, my reaction was slow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I stepped out into the hallway, but Himari was already gone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Once again, she got away.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Damn it!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I punched the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I might be making it sound serious, but basically, Himari won’t listen to me at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She is still ignoring my Line messages, and just the image of me talking to her one-sidedly in the classroom is too embarrassing…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve been photographed by classmates about three times today alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From a distance, the sound of slippers pattering approached.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yu-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Enomoto-san…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She seemed to be in a hurry. She must have been worried since the declaration of our falling out yesterday, and perhaps she came to check on us.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s really kind… no, wait. Please don’t run.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Specifically, Enomoto-san’s chest area is poisonous to the male eye, so please walk calmly, okay?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enomoto-san, gasping for breath, managed to say,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Just now, I got a Line from Hi-chan…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She hasn’t replied to me though!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I read the message. It said something like ‘I’m going to Tokyo, so please get along with Yuu,’such unnecessary meddling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s so like Himari. In the future, she might become an adult who annoys young people by meddling in their love lives… Wait, isn’t that just like Sakunee-san?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wonder if Himari is going to end up like that in the future. I don’t want that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yu-kun!? I don’t really understand, but we have to do something about Hi-chan now…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, that’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I shouldn’t be worrying about having another Sakunee-san around.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sorry…it’s my fault for saying I wanted to be a model…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, it’s not Enomoto-san’s fault. It’s Himari who’s being selfish.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“B-But…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When Enomoto-san looks so apologetic, it hurts my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“First, we need to find Himari…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oh, I have something good.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a small bag of cookies.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since there was no shop label, it must have been handmade by Enomoto-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s a beautiful girl that I really want as my wife.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yu-kun. I think this might be useful.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s an idea. Now that you mention it, I have some leftover sweets from this morning too.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, let’s use that as well…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">We moved to the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There was a colorful flowerbed where Himari and I had planted flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We scattered the crushed cookies and sweet crumbs around it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We hid in the shadows, quietly waiting for our prey to appear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“… She’s not coming.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hmm…Maybe Hi-chan isn’t hungry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Sparrows came fluttering in, pecking at the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a soothing scene. But feeding wild birds can lead to them settling in and causing problems with feces… Ahh! The sparrows suddenly took off into the sky en masse!</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You two, do you think I’m some kind of wild animal or what!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Across the courtyard, she was pointing sternly at us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But thanks to that, you showed up, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!? Damn!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Are you stupid?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, we’re just as stupid for doing this… Wait, could it be that she’s been keeping an eye on me from a place where I can be seen this whole time?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari! Just listen to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh, shut up! I have nothing to talk about with Yuu!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Liar! Then stop those attention-seeking moves!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Don’t call them attention-seeking moves!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I immediately chased after her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Unfortunately for her, my stride is overwhelmingly longer. And my reflexes are better, too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is one of the few things where I can beat Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I caught up with her on the landing of the stairs to the science lab.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I grabbed Himari’s arm to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She turned her face away from me, taking deep breaths. I was also out of breath…</p>
<p class="calibre5">This would look really bad if other students saw us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, why are you so angry? Why do you hate Enomoto-san being the model so much…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s arm moved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her right hand sharply struck my left cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s not about Enocchi! It’s because I’m fed up with that attitude of yours, Yuu!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That hurt. She really slapped me…!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was incredibly annoyed. After all, it was clearly Himari’s fault.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why do I have to get slapped, drenched in Calpis, and looked down upon by our classmates?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did I do something to deserve this? From the beginning, it was her who unnecessarily caused all this trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She brought Enomoto-san to Aeon, suggested she model, and then whimsically decided she didn’t want her to continue after it was over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And on top of that, she suddenly declared she was going to Tokyo…!</p>

<p class="calibre5">At least talk to me about it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Am I that insignificant to you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Were all those times you called us best friends a lie?</p>
<p class="calibre5">To you, am I just a toy to mess around with?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I hate this selfish side of you too!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Before I knew it, my hand had moved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I tried to grab Himari’s collar, but my grip shifted slightly. It was her neck that I had caught… I was holding onto the twinflower choker.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I forcefully pulled it towards me…the clasp had already been torn off by the time I realized what I had done.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">It was made from parts bought at a dollar store…so it wasn’t surprising if they had weakened over time. In fact, it’s miraculous it hadn’t broken before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the problem was, it had fallen to the floor… and I had stepped on it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I immediately had a bad feeling when I felt it under my shoe.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Lifting my foot… the diamond-shaped resin that encased the twinflower had a large crack in it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Resin is a plastic polymer… naturally, it can break under strong pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Furthermore, this was a failed piece with lots of bubbles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It had significant durability issues.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. This is…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Move your foot!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ughah!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a ferocious headbutt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It struck me squarely on the jaw.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After staggering, I crumpled to the spot…Himari’s face went pale, and she was trembling as she picked up the broken choker.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, this can’t be…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her expression was one of anguish. As if she was experiencing the end of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This made me feel an indescribable rage welling up inside.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s this all about? What do you really want to do?</p>
<p class="calibre5">You talk about abandoning people, but you’re making that face over a broken accessory.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah, I see.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it that in the end, the accessory was what mattered to you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, that makes sense. You said that from the beginning, friendship or stuff like that, it didn’t matter to you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why you can throw it away so easily, huh?</p>

<p class="calibre5">If it’s just the accessory, you can reorder it online. Even if not, there are plenty of replacements out there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari, to think I was the only one who valued you, I feel like such an idiot…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Fine. Go off to Tokyo or wherever on your own. To you, I’m just the accessory creator who does whatever you say, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari’s expression twisted, and her eyes widened as if she saw something unbelievable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her lips trembled. Then, a single tear streamed down her cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…That’s what you did, Yuu.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Her unexpected retort left me at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Me? Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari roughly wiped the area around her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, you see me just as a convenient hand who will do anything you say, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not true…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not? Then why did you make Enocchi the exclusive model? Why did you give the right to wear your accessories first to someone else? …You promised they were mine!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to deny it because I didn’t think of Himari as just a casual partner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…But considering the current situation. Himari’s words weren’t wrong at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That cultural festival in our second year of middle school…the after-party at Mos…Himari certainly said it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『So, how about you show those passionate eyes only to me? Let me have them all to myself? Then, I’ll sell as many of your accessories as you want&mdash;&mdash;Should we become that kind of fated partners?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">The one who broke the promise first was… me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Mistaking my silence for misunderstanding, Himari laughed scornfully.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You like Enocchi, don’t you? That’s why you want to put her first, right? I understand. I’ve come to know what it’s like to be in love now. I want to support you, Yuu. I want to bless Enocchi too. B-But…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari clenched the twinflower choker in her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I can’t be satisfied with being the second best!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was emotional, not like the usual Himari… Or perhaps she had always been there, but I just hadn’t tried to see it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, you used to consider me the most important, but now it’s different. You don’t even try to see how I feel, I can’t just laugh that off…!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to say that Himari had her faults too, and that it was wrong to snap at me without talking to me, I had a lot to say.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I couldn’t speak.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I knew that I had no right to say anything to Himari.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m going to where people need me!!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari swung back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The broken twinflower choker hit my left chest and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre5">All I could do was watch her back as she left.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;If only there was a reset button in life.</p>

<p class="calibre5">While thinking about such things, I slouched in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I sat on a bag of fertilizer piled up in the corner, morosely eating a convenience store bread.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The crumbs of the snacks I had scattered earlier were once again attracting sparrows.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, the sparrows took flight.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari… ah, it’s Makishima.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wahaha! Your blatantly disgusted face is nothing but a pleasure for me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That Makishima, holding a yakisoba bun and a croquette bun he apparently bought at the store, spread his arms dramatically… This guy is always eating these two.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If you hadn’t said that weird thing at Kandagawa, this wouldn’t have happened…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s what you call misplaced anger. It was clear that this would happen sooner or later.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s right on the mark. Yeah, I was just lashing out.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As long as I continued to misunderstand Himari, the wound would only spread beneath the surface.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I just came to see the fruits of what I’ve done. Got a problem with that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ve got nothing but complaints. Can’t you leave me alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s an option I can’t accept. I’ve been asked by Rin-chan to check up on you!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima sat down next to me and took a big bite of his yakisoba bun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He also offered me a Yōguruppe… I graciously accept it because my mouth is dry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The leftover bread really is the worst for lunch.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why did you suggest Enomoto-san to become the exclusive model?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s because I didn’t see any chance for Rin-chan to win otherwise. If Natsu had been snatched away as things were, we wouldn’t have been able to do anything. Well, I wanted to block the escape route before it turned into the myth of Amano-Iwato.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why though? I get that you support Enomoto-san, but taking the model position from Himari has nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Do you really think so? As expected of Natsu, you’re naïve.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">(TN: Amano-Iwato ( (天岩戸) refers to the “Heavenly Rock Cave,” in Shinto lore where the sun goddess Amaterasu hid, plunging the world into darkness until lured out by the other deities.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima chuckled softly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Let’s say hypothetically Rin-chan becomes Natsu’s lover, that alone won’t clear Rin-chan’s quest.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You know why, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima said meaningfully as he bit into the rest of his yakisoba bun.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Sometimes, the goal is harder to maintain than to achieve. It’s the same with love. Even if she get Natsu, it’s meaningless if it falls apart midway.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“When you say it, it’s frighteningly persuasive…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m speechless… I do want to handle things well, but it doesn’t always go as planned.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Seriously? Are you really serious about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course. Who would want to get stabbed?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…right.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was a mysterious weight to his words… After all, this guy is always in the middle of chaos.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima sighed softly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Put yourself in Rin-chan’s shoes. It would be pitiful if she got Natsu only to be shown how cozy Himari is with him. So, before she gets Natsu, it’s necessary to make it clear which one stands above the other.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But, Himari and I are just friends…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s funny. Then why are you so disturbed?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It hit me hard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Pleased with my demeanor, he leaned in close and, as usual, poked at my chest area.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Listen. ‘Like’ and ‘Love’ are in the end, just forms of affection. We just conveniently clothe them with the skins of ‘friendship’ and ‘romance’ and use them to suit our purposes. Therefore, they can easily change shape over trivial things. Like how recently Natsu has been feeling attracted to Himari-chan, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I dropped the convenience store bread… He had hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Why… How do you know that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“If that weren’t the case, you wouldn’t drone on about excuses for not making Rin-chan your girlfriend. What Natsu is concerned about is not Rin-chan’s feelings, but the guilt of being drawn to Himari. How can a love master like me would fail to notice?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You mean a playboy scumbag…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha. I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima passed me the remaining croquette bread, seemingly as a replacement for the dropped convenience store bread.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Forget all the vague stuff like love and friendship for now. The most important thing is who matters the most to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Are you trying to tempt me now? Aren’t you supposed to be on Enomoto-san’s side?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course, I’m on Rin-chan’s side. Sorry, but I have no remnants of sentimentality for a junior high school ex-girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then why? If you support Enomoto-san, it would be better if Himari went to Tokyo.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It seems it’s not such a simple matter.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima, unusually uncomfortable, sighed. Rubbing his hands together, he murmured softly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I did say I wanted Rin-chan to be the exclusive model, indeed to destroy the relationship between Natsu and Himari-chan. But this has clearly gone too far. Honestly, I didn’t think there would be such a miscalculation either.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Miscalculation, you mean Himari deciding to go to Tokyo?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. Normally, if relations sour, you’d just quietly take some distance. Actually, that level of balance was just normal. But Himari-chan’s actions now are as if she’s saying, ‘I have to leave my hometown to forget Natsu.’ …Who could have predicted that the always detached Himari-chan harbored such intense emotions?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That was something I understood too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The broken twinflower choker in my pocket. I remembered the moment when it was hurled at me earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Can’t be satisfied with being the second best, huh…</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t expect Himari to say such a thing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima stood up and stretched Turning back to me, he chuckled lightly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Himari-chan disappears like this, Rin-chan will think it’s her fault, right? After all, she’s like the sweet girl right out of a romantic comedy manga. I just don’t want to see my childhood friend in pain.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Oops, you seem doubtful. Well, I can’t blame you. To put it mildly, I’m not a very kind person. I’ve made countless girls cry, and now, to say I’m going to uphold my duty to a childhood friend…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wasn’t really asking him to go on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had always wondered why I got along with Makishima.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Honestly, Himari alone would have been enough for me as a friend. My values and Makishima’s didn’t align.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But somehow, I want to talk to him. No matter what he says, it doesn’t annoy me. I think I finally understand why.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…it’s similar. The way he’s mistaken about his own true nature resembles Himari. Maybe that’s why I can’t leave him alone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Makishima, you’re actually pretty kind…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ha?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Makishima’s suddenly froze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m not kind! Don’t be ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, what… I don’t need such a serious reaction…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t want to see a man’s blushing face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For just this moment, I wish he could swap faces with Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmph. Natsu, sometimes you show that kind of rebelliousness. Once you date Rin-chan and officially become my brother-in-law, I’ll straighten out that part of you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I said no, didn’t I!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nahaha. Well then, do as you like. It wouldn’t be bad to just let Himari-chan go to Tokyo and get together with Rin-chan. I’ve said it many times, but Rin-chan is top-notch as a girlfriend.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">With that, Makishima left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His back seemed to move in a good mood.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“He’s kind after all…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying it that way even though he knows that I will stop Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if it’s to erase Enomoto-san’s guilt, nobody can’t say that isn’t kind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But if it were that easy, I wouldn’t be struggling…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The bell signaling the end of lunch break rang. I have to return to the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Afternoon classes are going to be absolutely awkward, sitting next to Himari, .</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">Afternoon classes had begun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari and I sat next to each other, repeatedly tapping our mechanical pencil caps on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Both of us had temperaments that wouldn’t allow for skipping class, so the awkwardness was unbearable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The classical literature teacher, adjusting his glasses, asked, “Inuzuka-san, Natsume-kun… Is there something going on?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">” “What might that be?” ” we responded in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We glared at each other the moment we harmonized.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The teacher wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Well, normally I have to tell you off for being too loud. Today you’re unusually quiet, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” “Is that a problem?” ” we chorused again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seriously, this girl is annoying. Stop imitating me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Well, make up soon, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” “That’s not possible,” ” we replied together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I glanced at Himari, our eyes met for a moment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">We both looked away with a snort. The teacher shuddered.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Himari’s eyes were a little red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, I don’t know. I don’t want to be responsible for her crying.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Even if I’m told to do whatever I want…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the first place, it’s not my decision to make.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Himari wants to go to Tokyo, then she should do as she likes. I’m not the one providing her living expenses or paying her rent.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Besides, I can’t be carried on her back forever.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himari always says something about ‘until 30’, but it’s usually impossible to be with someone that long.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just like with accessories.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unless you get married, sharing so much time together is unrealistic.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, the time to part will come eventually. Whether Himari advances her studies, gets a boyfriend, or marries.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s not a distant future; the separation is bound to happen.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just that it might happen sooner.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…But moving out at the end of May is definitely too abrupt.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Considering it’s just before Golden Week, we really don’t even have a month left.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve never been scouted by a talent agency, so I don’t know, but is this how it always is?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I understand that the peak of beauty is short-lived and there’s a rush, but still.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took out my smartphone and sent a message on LINE.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Are you really going?』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Read within three seconds…You, pay attention to the class.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Going.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Why?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I want to visualize my own value.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">Visualize value… As always, she knows these complicated phrases.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I kind of understand what she means.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She wants proof that she’s needed by someone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Messages from Himari kept coming.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I don’t think Yuu would understand.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ve always been making accessories alone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Without anyone understanding, without anyone looking, and without being needed by anyone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(…I see. That’s all my fault.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">The first one who needed my accessories was Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thanks to Himari, my accessories gained life, and it was thanks to her that they became known to the world.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On that day, I promised to continue making accessories for Himari.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe this outcome was inevitable, because I failed to keep my promise.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Can’t you just not go to Tokyo after all?』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『No.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『I’ll get on my knees and refuse Enomoto-san’s modeling offer.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Onii-chan said that men are creatures who repeat the same mistakes.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『There’s no room for argument.』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『Then, this conversation is over.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I put my smartphone back in my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari is stubborn. Once she makes up her mind, it’s not easy to change her opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, whatever I say, the result probably won’t change.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himari will go to Tokyo, and I think she’ll surely become popular… Well, whatever she becomes, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whether I’m with her or not, that’s the future that awaits.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(…Then, it can’t be helped.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This conclusion…it can’t be helped either.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Really, life doesn’t always go the way you want it to.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And if it doesn’t go as I want it to… then I have to seize my ideal future with my own strength.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">Pffthaha.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That Yuu, what an idiot.</p>

<p class="calibre5">As if I’d go to Tokyo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why would I need to live where neither Grandpa nor Onii-chan are?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not so dissatisfied with my life that I’d want it filled with fans I don’t even know.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I like my hometown, after all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even if it’s the countryside, you’ll come to love it if you live here, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sure, it’s so rural that I have to travel an hour by train to the nearest Aeon Mall just to see the latest movie, but planning a long trip with Yuu is fun, and while we may not have those trendy Harajuku pancake shops, the cakes at Enocchi’s shop are a hundred million times tastier.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu really get on my nerves.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m not the kind of girl to lightly accept an invitation from a scout I don’t even know.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Well, it seems that my fake crying earlier worked…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">This is one of my ultimate ‘begging techniques.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">If I do this, everyone listens to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the ultimate weapon for attacking Grandpa and Onii-chan. It’s the strongest move I’ve never shown Yuu before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With this, even Yuu can’t remain unfazed.</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, really…it was fake crying… There’s no way I would actually cry. Just over Yuu’s broken accessory… I have plenty more of Yuu’s accessories…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Uhhh…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Stop-stop! Don’t remember what’s in the past!</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I’m seen crying during class, it’ll just make Yuu more conceited.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Always with that smug face, ‘Ha. You really like me too much, don’t you?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s so annoying! Not that I like you or anything, okay!?</p>

<p class="calibre5">(Argh! My neck feels all chilly!…I’ll definitely make him make me a new one later.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">Anyway… Hehehe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The damage to Yuu is severe.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems he’s finally come to realize my greatness and importance. Serves him right.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Now, I just have to wait for Yuu to come crawling on his knees.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While looking down at him as he pathetically cries, 【Don’t go, oh great Himari-sama!】</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll laugh haughtily and say, 【Yuu-kun, you’re hopeless. Well then, let’s talk about the terms of negotiation!】</p>

<p class="calibre5">First, we’ll establish a monthly ‘Appreciation Day for Himari-sama.’ On this day, Yuu must devote himself entirely to listening to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And about the flower accessories. Of course, from now on, he’ll make them solely for me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi can model too, but I come first. I am the First Lady. Okay?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Also, let’s introduce a ‘trial kiss’ system.</p>
<p class="calibre5">From now on, Yuu must never refuse when I demand a trial kiss.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s payback for wounding a maiden’s heart. Whether at school or at Aeon, there is no right to refuse!</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I feel like I’m getting off-topic, but oh well!</p>

<p class="calibre5">(People can become this cruel when victory is in sight. It’s frightening, I’m scared of myself… Pfft.)</p>

<p class="calibre5">While observing Yuu’s face of despair, I revel in delight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">The classical Japanese literature class ended, and after school arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now then. He should be coming soon, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s Yuu, so he’ll definitely come and say, ‘Himari, I need to talk.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I guess I’ll wait for him to call me before I go home.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Hmm?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Upon realizing it, Yuu from the seat next to me was gone. His bag wasn’t there either… When did he leave?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hey, do you know where Yuu went?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I asked a classmate who was still in the room, but they just said, “He went home a while ago.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Well, that’s Yuu for you.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s so melodramatic. He probably needs some time alone first to cry over the sorrow of losing me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Alright, I forgive him! That part of Yuu, it’s cute, so I don’t hate it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Go ahead and soak your pillow with tears!</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then comes the weekend.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I figure he’ll come crying to me around this time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was constantly checking my phone, I was also all dressed up stylishly just in case Yuu called.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…But he didn’t call.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Strange. Was he that shocked?</p>
<p class="calibre5">On Sunday night, I checked Facebook and Twitter. 『You』’s account… no particular changes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see, I had it wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My announcement about going to Tokyo was more shocking to Yuu than I expected, wasn’t it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What a cutie. Forgiven!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let’s see, while I’m at it, I might as well check Enocchi’s Twitter account.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She frequently updates with photos of sweets, which is really cute.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She never follows me back, but I don’t mind as long as I can see her posts!</p>

<p class="calibre5">(…what?)</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was a photo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A double cone from Baskin-Robbins at Aeon. As expected of the heir to a Western confectionery, she’s on top of checking the new flavors.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The problem is that there were two of them in the photo. Enocchi’s hand and someone else’s.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That’s Yuu’s hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There’s no way I mistook it. That rugged men’s ring he wore on the hand…it’s the one that I bought for him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Plus, she wrote, ‘Came to pick out flowers with a school friend!’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only person who would go to a florist with Enocchi on a weekend is Yuu.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Then came Monday, and for the first time, I couldn’t sleep until the morning and was late for school.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was so embarrassing. Especially Yuu’s cold gaze that seemed to say, ‘What the heck is she doing?’ hurt so much.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then the Golden Week holiday started and ended.</p>
<p class="calibre5">During that time…nothing really happened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After the holiday, the Instagram for the ‘Love’ accessory line was updated without me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi’s best shot had gotten a lot of likes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There were many comments like ‘A new model!?’ and ‘She’s cute too!’ but Yuu hadn’t replied to any.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Actually, that was supposed to be my job.</p>

<p class="calibre5">This time, photos of the creation process were also posted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They introduced an eat-in corner at Enocchi’s Western confectionery store.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There were photos of Enocchi and the regulars having a good time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu was in them, too, seriously eating a cake…even though he never took up my offers to eat together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And there was a close-up of Makishima-kun. I see, so he took my place.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s really annoying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it weren’t for this guy starting strange conversations, things wouldn’t have gotten so awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That provocatively smug smile, he must be assuming I’ll be seeing this …I’ll just report this photo for violation.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even when school started again, Yuu was completely unchanged.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…With less than a month to go, he still wouldn’t talk to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">One afternoon, they were busily picking flowers from the flower beds in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Enocchi was helping, too, and they seemed to be having fun.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was painful to see their relationship seeming so ripe. By now, they’re probably making beautiful floral accessories together.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It really feels like there’s no place for me anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(It’s okay-it’s okay. There’s still about two weeks left…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">I mean, I am incredibly cute, right? Once I go to Tokyo, I’ll definitely be super popular, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re probably just intimidated because I’m out of their league.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Hey, are you really okay with this?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Aren’t you being a little too obedient?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m really going to leave, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Shouldn’t you be coming to me crying by now?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Then suddenly, I remembered. Those words Yuu said by the Kanda River.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Besides, if you keep coming up with pranks or whatever each time we make themed accessories…it’s a bit troublesome.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wake up, Himari. You were turned down once, weren’t you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no way he would go out of his way to keep such a troublesome girl…</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was mid-May. The weather was gloomy, and rainy days were increasing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The hydrangeas in the garden of our mansion were blooming nicely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Back in middle school, Yuu and I used to turn these into really cute necklaces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, the language of flowers for hydrangeas means ‘fickleness,’ ‘Unfaithful,’ ‘Impermanent’… Haha, it’s almost making me cry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">My steps were heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I opened the front door, the cold, unwelcoming atmosphere of my home greeted me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wonder if Mom isn’t home today.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’m home…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Entering the kitchen, unusually, Onii-chan had come home first.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He was silently drinking coffee while spreading out the evening paper.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Seeing that he hadn’t changed out of his suit, he must be thinking about work. You can tell what’s on his mind by his clothing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s best to leave him alone at times like this. Onii-chan may look silly, but I heard that his work is incredibly busy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">After washing my hands and gargling, I poured myself a cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I also take some Baumkuchen for myself from the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s probably something Mom got from the ladies’ association. She sure has her hands full with neighborhood relations.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…While I was thinking that, Onii-chan lifted his head from the newspaper. He finally seemed to notice me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He smiled and said with his usual kind expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, welcome home.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m home, Onii-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Mom is still out at the field. There’s curry in the pot for dinner, so just help yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">No wonder it smells good.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Hehe. Spicy and soothing to my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Bread or rice, which should I go with?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s quite humid today, maybe I’ll toast the bread until it’s crispy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, do we still have that whole loaf of bread?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I could go all out and hollow it out to make something like a Chicago-style curry gratin…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, Himari. You haven’t been talking about Yuu-kun recently, have you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I froze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was caught off guard and visibly shaken. Onii-chan must have noticed this with his keen eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Calm down, me. It’s not a fatal blow yet. If I just casually report back as if nothing’s wrong, it’ll be fine.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan would say something like, ‘That’s tough. By the way, take this 10,000 yen and go buy some ice cream to eat, hahaha’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, yeah, you know, we’re kind of fighting… Well, it’s nothing serious…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ho…It’s rare for you guys to fight.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ahaha. Yeah, it’s unusual. But things like this happen, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. Things like that happen. It’s only natural for things not to go smoothly in youth.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, Onii-chan seemed convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Relieved, I placed the whole loaf of bread on the cutting board.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll hollow it out, pour in the curry, and top it with plenty of cheese…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, what’s this about a trivial fight that has led to you two not speaking for over two weeks?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I accidentally dropped the knife I was using to hollow out the bread.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a close call, the knife was sticking to the floor between my legs. …Seriously, this is just a bread knife.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t our house way too old and dangerous?</p>

<p class="calibre5">Turning around, Onii-chan was smiling at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was as if he was saying, ‘Did you think you could deceive the eyes of a handsome guy like me with such a feeble disguise? …Huh, how foolish.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, ahh, umm…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Haha. It’s simple, Himari. The ‘Yuu-kun’s dose’ that I usually feel from you has been rapidly declining over the past two weeks. Despite it being completely depleted, there has been no sign of replenishment recently. Unless something has happened to Yuu-kun, then it must mean that Himari is being avoided, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">How does he know!?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is the ‘Yuu’s dose’ something visible!?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wow, as expected of Onii-chan. It’s no wonder you’re my Onii-chan…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course. For the sake of my future brother-in-law, I’m working tirelessly to transform this town into a more livable place.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I honestly thought, ‘Wow, that’s creepy.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why, despite being cool and having a good personality, Onii-chan can’t get a girlfriend.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan, still radiating a mysterious sparkling aura, demanded an explanation from me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, well, it’s a bit much for Onii-chan to be sticking his nose into his sister’s private life…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“The fact that Himari won’t confide in me means there must be something you don’t want me to know, right? That means… Himari, it’s like admitting that you are at fault.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">S-Sharp…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan, you understand me so well.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Spit it out.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Ugh!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The pressure from his smile was intense.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This aspect is really something he inherited from our grandfather.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With a forced smile, ‘Hehe…’ I started to speak in bits and pieces.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu rejected me, so I lied and said I’m going to Tokyo, and now I’m waiting for him to apologize…or something like that…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……..”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan was staring at me with an expressionless face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Click-, click-, click-, I could tell Onii-chan’s thoughts were racing, and with just those few words, he precisely deduced the situation and then&mdash;&mdash;he turned into an ogre-like expression.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“──You big idiottttttttttttt!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was a roar loud enough to shake our mansion.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s actually trembling! It’s like a typhoon is passing through! Scary, really scary…!</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was paralyzed with fear, Onii-chan slammed one foot onto the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Glaring at me in a pose like a monster, he howled.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You’re trying to corner Yuu-kun into a situation where he has no choice but to apologize so that you can get what you want, right!? What you’re doing isn’t just your usual wheedling&mdash;it’s blackmailing! Shame on you as a member of the Inuzuka family!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I sit in seiza and bow deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s absolutely right, and there’s no room for argument.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan really hates this kind of underhanded behavior…!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What would you do if this negatively affects Yuu-kun’s mental state! It would be a great loss to the world!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After venting his last bit of fury with ragged breaths, Onii-chan sat back at the table.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Tap-, tap-, he tapped on the opposite side of the table with his finger.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was a sign that meant ‘Sit down,’ ‘Prepare for a sermon,’ and ‘Then die.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I did as told. I sit across from him and shrink into myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, are you planning to break our promise?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His voice was quieter than before.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That only made it feel sharper like a razor-edged blade stabbing into my stomach…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“You made me bow down to that Enomoto during the cultural festival in junior high school. I had to prostrate myself, lick heels, and was forced to sing Nishino Kana songs in front of everyone! I’ve never tasted such humiliation, not even at work!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s a reward for Onii-chan…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I said I limit it to 2D characters!! It seems you’re not reflecting at all, are you!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m sorry-I’m sorry!</p>
<p class="calibre5">My mouth just moves on its own!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“I-I know that Onii-chan has a terribly bad relationship with Enocchi’s older sister…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. I did it because you said it was your once-in-a-lifetime request. I got that Enomoto to promote on Twitter and spread the word to as many friends and juniors as possible, just to sell nearly 200 of those accessories!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan rubbed his arms irritably.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably got goosebumps just from remembering that time…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But the reason I helped you was that I myself was charmed by Yuu-kun’s accessories. They are wonderful. Someday, they will surely make this town’s name resound across the world!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Right? I knew Onii-chan had good taste…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, my cheeks loosened with pride as Yuu’s accessories were praised.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Instantly noticing it, Onii-chan glared at me sharply… That’s no good, no good at all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. Do you remember the condition I gave you for helping Yuu-kun’s accessories sell out?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…yes, it was to not abandon the support for Yuu’s specialty shop halfway through…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. At that time, Yuu-kun was definitely at a crossroads in his life. With your selfishness, you stripped away all other career choices from his life except for being an accessory creator, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That is another sound argument.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That’s true. If Yuu’s accessories hadn’t sold at that time, the dream of opening a specialty shop would have disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But conversely, if Yuu could achieve the sale of ‘100 accessories,’ his life would have no way out other than that path.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if he becomes fed up halfway, time doesn’t turn back.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With his academic background, becoming a civil servant is out of the question, and I can’t imagine that Yuu, with his communication issues, could successfully climb the corporate ladder.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even if the shop opened, it could fail to generate enough sales and go under.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What remains wouldn’t just be the remnants of a dream but also a mountain of debt that couldn’t be repaid easily.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Our family owns the land, so I’ve seen many such cases since I was a child.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Dreams are harder to maintain than to achieve.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s why Onii-chan made me promise.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Not to touch the Inuzuka family’s money and to maintain Yuu’s shop with my own efforts until death.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Back then, I boasted that it would be a breeze for cute little me… but I never imagined it would fall apart like this.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan’s eyes sparkled fiercely. Leaning over the table, he glared at me intently.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. I didn’t give you special treatment. I helped you because I believed it would ultimately benefit Yuu-kun. You weren’t just thinking you could throw it away once you got bored, were you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s not like that… that’s not it at all…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then what is this mess? Just because you dislike something, you’ve thrown out your support for Yuu-kun. Do you think I’m not checking Instagram? It’s fine that Enomoto’s sister is modeling, but why haven’t you replied to customers? That’s your job, and neglecting it interferes with Yuu-kun’s accessory making, don’t you realize that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">From the start, he seemed to have seen right through the anomaly here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Rather, he set up this time for conversation to confirm his suspicions.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh no, my Onii-chan cares too much about Yuu and now I’m in trouble!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I-It’s not Yuu’s fault…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Not bad! Your romantic feelings and your responsibility towards the flower accessories are separate issues! If you have time to cry here, why don’t you hurry up and go apologize?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I bit my lip. Clutching my skirt tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand my feelings at all. He always convinces me with his seemingly sound theories.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But there are things that can’t be solved with such theories.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But what about my feelings…?!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I shouted out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Crying shamefully… for the first time in my life, I rebelled against Onii-chan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ve fallen in love with Yuu! It’s impossible to just go back to being best friends now! Are you telling me to give up, Onii-chan? Am I supposed to just watch him being all lovey-dovey with Enocchi forever?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan just stared at me. His usually reliable and calm eyes now seemed terribly intimidating.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then he said coldly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. You need to give up on those romantic feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I tried to stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But the moment I did&mdash;I was glared at fiercely.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Instantly, I felt as though I had lost control of my body, dropping back into the chair&mdash;&mdash;I felt like a frog being stared at by a snake.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since Onii-chan started working at the city hall, his skills have clearly become inhuman.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Don’t be emotional. Listen to what I have to say to the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Y-Yes, Brother…!” (TN: I, iesu (yes), burazā(brother),(い, イエス, ブラザー))</p>

<p class="calibre5">I should listen properly… because if I ran away, I’d only be tied up with rough rope and lectured by him anyway.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s most important to you, Himari? Is it those romantic feelings, or… is it having Yuu-kun for yourself?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…..?????”</p>

<p class="calibre5">What? What does that mean?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t that the same thing…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, life is finite. No matter how much money you have, no matter how good you are at begging, it’s impossible to have everything you want at once.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, abruptly, he began to talk about his own life.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I listened in confusion, Onii-chan continued.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I approved a highway construction. But in exchange, I took away something precious from many people. I destroyed a house that held a family’s memories. Because of the elevated highway, there are lands that no longer get sunlight. I’ve received numerous complaints. Even now, they outnumber the words of thanks by a large margin.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I listened in astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It was the first time Onii-chan had ever talked about his work.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Whenever I asked, he would just brush me off, saying ‘It’s too early for you, Himari.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But for the sake of this town a hundred years from now, it was absolutely necessary. I am doing something that will be beneficial for the town, long after I’m gone.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, with one last remark, he added quietly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Walk through life like that. Discard the 99 to win the truly important one in the end. If you do that, you can win.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then Onii-chan returned to reading the evening paper in silence, his demonic expression from earlier gone as if it were a lie, replaced by a face as serene as a still water surface.</p>

<p class="calibre5">To be honest&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t fully grasp what Onii-chan was saying.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But I thought it must be right. He must have experienced so much more than someone like me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">After all, Onii-chan went through the same youth as I did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Onii-chan wouldn’t say anything that wasn’t for my benefit.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, even though I don’t quite understand it now…I’ve decided to give up on everything only when I eventually understand the meaning and still can’t accept it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">It was after school the following day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had been glaring at my smartphone in the classroom the entire time.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What was open was the LINE app. I was on the chat screen with Yuu, typing messages only to erase them over and over again.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Calling Yuu out… was fine, but how should I do it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Scrolling through the chat screen, it feels like just yesterday, but there’s a Mariana Trench-level gap in these few centimeters…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, I guess I should keep it as light as it usually is.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Heyyy, Yuu. How’s it goin’? (This is like a play on words with ‘Yuu’ and ‘you’ ♡ Did you notice???). You know, you haven’t been talking to me recently ~ I’m feeling lonely (boo-hoo)』</p>

<p class="calibre5">No, who am I kidding?</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s like a one-hit-wonder comedian who pops up on TV only to disappear again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I want to talk to Yuu so badly, my brain’s going haywire.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Delete, delete.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If I sent that, I’d definitely be ignored. I would do that if it were me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I need to be a bit more serious. This is an important conversation, after all.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Yuu, there’s something I need to talk about. It’s important.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">With a whoosh, the message is sent off to the chat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Now, until I get a reply… whoa, seen in three seconds. That’s too fast.</p>

<p class="calibre5">What’s this about? Do you like me that much~?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Always checking LINE and open my message on impulse, did you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Nfufu~, what a shamelessly adorable person~.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I feel like a boomerang just hit me, but oh well!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Let’s see, Yuu’s reply is…</p>

<p class="calibre5">『I have something to talk about too. I’m in the science lab.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t read him at all…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Isn’t Yuu just too much on autopilot? Shouldn’t he be a bit more flustered? It’s a message from the cutest me, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, whatever…Let’s go.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The science lab is about a five-minute walk away. I pass by it all the time, so I’m confident I can get there even with my eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Staring at the science lab’s door, I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is bad, I’m getting nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Suddenly my stomach hurts too. Maybe I should just call it off. It doesn’t have to be today.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And what’s this talk Yuu mentioned about?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Ah, could it be ‘I’ve decided to go out with Enomoto-san’?</p>

<p class="calibre5">That’s totally possible. In fact, I can’t think of anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s been three weeks, after all. During that time, they must have met several times, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…They probably shared Baskin-Robbins ice cream together, right?</p>

<p class="calibre5">I can’t take this. Specifically, the thought of Yuu saying with a refreshing smile, ‘Himari, you’re like a cupid of love. Grateful I am, my best ☆ friend (smilingwithasparklingtooth)’</p>

<p class="calibre5">…again, who am I kidding? This kind of Yuu, I’ll gladly give him away with a gift ribbon on top!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Anyway, I should strategically retreat and rethink my strategy…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Woah!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Came the surprise voice from behind!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Turning around, there’s the usual Yuu standing. Just like I saw him in the 6th-period class earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Enocchi is not here. Looks like he’s alone.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. Don’t just stand there, come in already.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I entered the science lab.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s the same as always. Ah, no, maybe a little different.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On the table, there are lots of cardboard boxes piled up. Inside them, there are accessories made from beautifully processed flowers from the flower beds, ready to be shipped to customers.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And the steel shelves that were left open. They’re now empty.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The LED planters and the tools for making accessories, all of them are neatly packed in cardboard boxes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…It looks like preparations for moving.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So, what’s this talk about, Himari?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Cutting straight to the main topic so abruptly, my body shrinks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu, while organizing the cardboard boxes, didn’t look my way. That attitude is somewhat frustrating.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I see. So my important talk isn’t worth even making eye contact for.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Suddenly, my irritation comes flooding back. Wanting to break that damn calm attitude, I smile broadly… and tell another lie.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nfufu~. It’s nothing major, but you know, there’s been progress with that entertainment agency I mentioned. I thought I’d report it. They came to visit me, and the conditions they offered are really good. They’re even preparing an apartment for me, and transportation is all set. Above all, the guy in charge is super cool. Urban men really have a different vibe, don’t they~”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ahh~~~!!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why the heck!? I already turned down that email long ago! I’m really just making a fool of myself!</p>
<p class="calibre5">…No, well, it’s not completely a lie. The conditions they presented were true.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And Yuu’s reply was… just one word.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…I see. That’s great.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Stab-</p>
<p class="calibre5">He doesn’t even try to look at me. Just silently continues to organize the cardboard boxes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Is that really it? Nothing more to say?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ahh, I’m such an idiot. Right. Because, after all, he says I’m “troublesome.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">Maybe I was deluding myself.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…We’ve already reached a point of no return, haven’t we?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What is it you wanted to talk about, Yuu?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I said it with a feeling of desperation.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, finally, Yuu looked up. Turned to face me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“No, I just have something I want to give to Himari…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…To me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yeah, before you go to Tokyo, there’s something I feel I have to do…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, Yuu pulled out a brown envelope from his uniform pocket. It’s one of those sold at our school store.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He handed it to me with an indifferent manner.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…When I received it, it felt like a letter?</p>

<p class="calibre5">What could it be? It’s quite thick. Could it be a letter of disownment?</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ah, I see. Yuu are conscientious, so that’s what it is. Maybe it’s about splitting the earnings so far.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s somewhat shocking. Was I really seen in that way?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t need the money, though.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Thinking that, I checked the contents.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『Dropout Application』</p>

<p class="calibre5">The air froze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While I was completely losing my ability to think, Yuu muttered ‘Ah’ and snatched it back, putting it in his pocket.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Oops. This wasn’t it…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Wait, wait, wait!! What was that just now!? Hey, Yuu! What was that ominous document just now!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, I don’t really know the proper way to drop out, and it’s just a makeshift solution for now. I bought the envelope just now at the store, but I guess I should get a proper one…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not questioning the quality of the envelope though&mdash;!!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seeing my face, Yuu burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s rare to see you making a comment like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s because you’re saying something stupid, Yuu!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Realizing I was genuinely angry, Yuu awkwardly averted his gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I might just quit school.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“……….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was too much…yes, too unexpected. I was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why? Why would Yuu quit?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just because I said I was going to Tokyo, why does Yuu have to quit school too…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I’ll go to Tokyo as well. I’ll follow Himari.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Follow me…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Does that mean…huh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I don’t understand at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh, maybe as a courtesy to his former partner, he wants to check out the talent agency that’s taking care of me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or is he planning to indulge in sightseeing in Tokyo with me?</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, no, that would be strange to quit school for. He could just come to play during the summer break.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I actually know.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Preparing for the move without selling the new accessories, hastily harvesting and processing the flowers from the flower bed.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But there’s no way, right? That’s impossible…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, are you serious about this…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu nodded firmly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Makishima told me to decide what’s most important…I guess it’s Himari.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those words sank heavily in my stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As I lost the ability to speak, Yuu continued without concern.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Originally, I went to high school because my parents wished it, but the biggest reason was to be with Himari. However, I guess I won’t be forgiven. I’d be disowned by my parents, and I’ll have to find a way to make a living.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What about Enocchi? You’ve finally reunited…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then Yuu looked frustrated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Usually, his expression is hard to read because he looks so stern, but that expression was uncharacteristically childlike.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He spoke slowly as if to make sure he wouldn’t be misunderstood, savoring each word.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, you might be misunderstanding something. Sure, she’s my first love and actually super cute. But that doesn’t mean she’s more important than…my best friend now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu added that at the end and his face turned red.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He’s trying to cover his mouth with his hand, but it’s not hidden at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…He really means it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The moment I understood that my face also heated up.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you planning to give up everything just to follow me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, it can’t be helped it. I sowed the seeds myself…Oh, I mean flower seeds, get it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s not funny at all; I can’t even laugh. Don’t ever say that again.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu was genuinely disheartened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…I really annoyed when he can’t read the room.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, you say as if it’s easy to get a job, but… you might not be able to make flower accessories anymore, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But, if I’m fixated on that, I’ll lose Himari. Even if I make the best flower accessories… it’s boring without you.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying that, he looked straight at me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari, if I can’t make flower accessories, is there no point in me being there with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I thought it was unfair. If he said it like that, I couldn’t stop Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is there a reason to be with Yuu other than flower accessories?</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Of course, there are. There are plenty.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I love spending afternoons borrowing and reading manga with Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love the moments when we watch YouTube together on a single smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love stopping by Mos Burger after school with Yuu and fighting over onion rings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love going to the big Aeon Mall in the neighboring town by train with Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I love searching for Instagrammable shops on bicycles with Yuu during the weekends.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I absolutely love the moment we laugh together saying, ‘Damn, where are we!?’ after getting lost in backstreets for about an hour.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I knew all along what it meant to be together.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I-It’s not like that…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">That was all I could manage to say.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Seriously, it’s impossible. When I look at Yuu’s face, I seriously might accidentally confess.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I feel like I might repeat the same mistake… Really, love is bad for my health.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Yuu. Lend me that withdrawal notice.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">When I said that, Yuu looked puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But as told, he handed over the brown envelope.</p>
<p class="calibre5">──Then I tore it up into pieces.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah&mdash;! What are you doing!?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What are you doing, should be my line! You say some cool things, but don’t push the responsibility onto me!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“But originally, you’re the one who said we’re in this fate together…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s true! But that was strictly in terms of business management! I wouldn’t allow you to do something like suicide because of that!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hey, calling it a suicide act is a bit too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Then, what about a guarantor? What are you planning to do when renting a room?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh… do I really need that?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Of course you do! Going to Tokyo with just the clothes on your back nowadays, that’s really like a suicide act!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, in ‘Weathering with You’ that we watched together, they managed somehow, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“They weren’t managing well at all!! It was interesting, but you can’t use that as a reference!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seriously, Yuu has these sorts of things about him.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Really… you’re hopeless without me, aren’t you?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I properly rolled up the torn pieces of paper and put them in the pocket of my bag.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While at it, I took out a pack of Yoguruppe that was in there. I poked a straw in and, just like always, took a cool sip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I let out a sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I thought it’d be more romantic somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, it’s Yuu after all. It can’t be helped.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇ ◇ ◇</strong></p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s okay. I won’t go anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Eh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu reacted.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He grabbed my shoulders and brought his face close with determination.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was so surprised that the Yoguruppe I was drinking came out of my nose!</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Seriously!? But you’ve already said your goodbyes!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Cough-cough. No, what I said earlier wasn’t a lie… but oh, that’s right. My, Onii-chan opposed it, he’d stop me if I did that anyway…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You said you wanted to become someone who is needed by the fans, didn’t you!?”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/LN_V1_12.jpg">

<p class="calibre5">“I never said that&mdash;! Yuu, you really don’t get me at all! And get your face away from me!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pushed Yuu’s face away with both hands forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Stop it, just stop. If you bring that face any closer right now, I really won’t be able to stay sane.</p>
<p class="calibre5">To be honest, I’d want to kiss him. I definitely don’t want my first kiss with Yuu to be with Yoguruppe from my nose!</p>
<p class="calibre5">I kept Yuu at the desk and let out a sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu and I will stay the same as always… It’s fine if Enocchi wants to model, but I’d be happy if you prioritize me, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah, got it…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The atmosphere was embarrassingly awkward…Switch gears, switching gears is important.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The Yoguruppe pack made a slurping sound.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s this thing you wanted to give me?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">You mentioned it earlier, right?</p>
<p class="calibre5">If it’s not the withdrawal application, there must be something else. I won’t forget just because of the atmosphere, you know?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If Himari isn’t going to Tokyo, then it’s nothing…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hurry up. Hurry, hurry up.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Do I have to give it to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, you do. Come on, hand it over.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I gestured with my palm up, urging him on.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu seemed resigned as he reached into his pocket.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himari. Somehow, the order got reversed, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then he placed a brown envelope in my palm.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s the same as the earlier withdrawal application… See, that’s why you get it mixed up!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, seriously, I didn’t have time to prepare. When I went to buy the envelope for the withdrawal application, I just thought this would do… It was really hard to find, and I only managed to make it like I wanted yesterday.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t a document.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I turned it upside down and shook it toward my palm, a ring fell out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“What’s this…?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but be captivated.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A transparent resin ring. Usually, only the decorative part is fixed with resin, but this ring was made entirely of clear resin.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And within the resin, there floated an extremely small preserved twinflower. It conjured the image of a fairy’s playground.</p>
<p class="calibre5">While gazing into it, I muttered in astonishment.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is this really a twinflower…? It’s a proper flower, but isn’t it too small?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Twinflowers are indeed small, but to encase an entire flower in a ring is another story. Yet, there were several floating inside.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yuu cracked a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“A miniature twinflower made from preserved flowers…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I looked closer.</p>
<p class="calibre5">…Are these all miniatures?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I did it under a microscope, and I failed many times. It was incredibly exhausting. I probably can’t make the same one again…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu then pulled out that broken twinflower choker from his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre5">He held it apologetically… as if it were something precious.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I broke this choker. So, think of this as a replacement, or rather, a statement of my intentions for a new life. …A ‘best friend’ ring that only Himari has in the world.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, he bashfully turned his face away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yet, he was tense, as if waiting for my reaction. With that awkwardness, Yuu still said it properly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“To me, Himari is still my best friend. That’s why I think there may be times like today when I get careless and make you mad. But it doesn’t mean someone else is more important. This is the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">His way of speaking was so clumsy, so honest, so Yuu-like… And embarrassingly, it made me feel ticklish.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Himari. Is this not good enough?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahahaha! Yuu, you’re the best! After you’ve shown me something like this, how could this not be good enough!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">All the anger I had felt, all the irritation towards Yuu… it had truly become irrelevant.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This was dangerous. Really dangerous. Only a freak could make something like this.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu. Turn around for a second.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Uh, why?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Just do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu looked back suspiciously.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I threw my arms around his back with all my might.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Taah!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Whoa, that’s dangerous!?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I wrapped my arms around his neck, holding up the ‘best friend’ ring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then I begged cutely in his ear as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Please put it on for me♡”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“No, put it on yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I don’t wanna. Can you do it, Yuu?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu hesitantly took my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then… he slipped the ring onto the middle finger of my left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Tsk. I whispered into Yuu’s ear.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Coward.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I told you, it’s a ‘best friend’ ring.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Pfft…By the way, what’s this tiny brown thing?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was something floating inside, like a single seed of a flower, serving as an accent, and it was very striking.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…It’s a twinflower seed.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was an oddly long pause, but oh well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Huh, interesting. I had never seen the seeds before. They were shaped like tiny brown crescents…Nice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The resin ring was indescribably smooth on the surface… and it fit perfectly on my skin as if clinging to it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When held up to the fluorescent light, the resin transmitted the light… it was so amazing that it seemed out of this world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Just like the relationship between Yuu and me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Intangible promises, yet they still become the bridge that connects us.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yuu, just choose me already…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Those words slipped out unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was different from the usual jokes I made; it ignited an unextinguishable warmth within me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…what?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yuu looked puzzled, his expression blank.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It was amusing yet frustrating… but well, I thought I’d let him off the hook this time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">(It’s still too early…)</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s too early for my flame of love to spread to Yuu.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Life is long, and it’s harder to maintain a dream than to achieve one.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We have to overcome many similar crises and build a bond as solid as this ‘best friend’ ring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And I will be content to win just once&mdash;&mdash;at the very end.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I smiled broadly at Yuu. I corrected myself more clearly.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“If we’re both still single when we turn 30, choose me, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Well, if I’m single, then sure.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">He took out his smartphone from his pocket, aimed the camera at us, and with a small beep&mdash;&mdash;we made another promise.</p>

<p class="calibre3">♣♣♣</p>

<p class="calibre5">The moment we looked at the photo we had taken together, Himari said, ‘I’m gonna go wash my nose in the restroom!’ and left the science lab.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Nose?</p>
<p class="calibre5">I didn’t quite understand why it’s nose, but it seemed like Himari’s mood had improved.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it was actually better than before. Meanwhile, I groaned, holding my head.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah~… Thank goodness~…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Somehow, I’m glad Himari reconsidered transferring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, it’s true that Himari is the most important to me. My resolve to quit school was real, and so was my intention to follow her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But it’s also true that I was scared because it was too reckless…</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, I’m still a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre5">When I was told I needed a guarantor to rent a room, I nearly went white…I should at least get my license as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="calibre5">The door to the science lab opened.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I thought Himari had come back, but it was… Makishima. He had an incredibly nasty smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">People really can make such cruel smiles sometimes.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Nahahaha! Natsu, you’re really showing off, aren’t you!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">So he had been watching.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, well, it makes sense since I finished the accessory yesterday, and he must have heard about it from Enomoto-san.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“By the way, could you leave before Himari gets back? It’d be awkward.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s awkward for me too. I have to attend a consolation cake party for Rin-chan. Seriously, I’m not even fond of sweets!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I see…Enomoto-san was watching too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What face am I supposed to greet them with tomorrow?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But Natsu, at the very end, you chickened out, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I-I didn’t chicken out. I told her everything.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Nahaha. Then why did you lie about it being a twinflower seed?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Ugh.</p>
<p class="calibre5">No, well, when I went to order that flower, I happened to run into these guys who were there checking out new sweets.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It’s common for everyone to go to Aeon on their days off…It’s a rural area problem.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Makishima said with a sly grin.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“That was a tulip seed, wasn’t it? Moreover, a seed from a purple tulip.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…That’s right. Twinflower seeds are much smaller and are diamond-shaped and greenish.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I’m not very familiar with tulip seeds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They’re usually sold as bulbs, and that’s how we were supposed to plant them in elementary school. But before they become bulbs, they can be collected as seeds, and they do actually exist.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The reason is, it takes too long to grow from seeds. It can take about five years for the flowers to bloom, and even then, they often don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre5">For that reason, they’re not commonly found in flower shops or home centers. That’s why I went to Aeon that day to collect them.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“So? Why did you back down?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The purple tulip.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Its flower language is&mdash;’Eternal Love.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">A flower that pledges love that never fades, that never dies.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Within the unwavering friendship, a faint romantic feeling was subtly mixed in. That was what “Himari” meant to me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was supposed to convey that too, but…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Because I’d want to die if I got rejected at that moment…!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then Makishima burst out laughing and left.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Someday.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If we can open a shop together, then I’ll convey it properly with my own words.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for now, I’m just a little unprepared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My best friend is too cute, and I’m really having a hard time these days…</p>

<p class="calibre3">♢♢♢</p>

<p class="calibre5">In the restroom, I wash my hands under the running water and think.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The face that’s reflected in the mirror is really awful… I can’t go back to Yuu for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre5">But the calmer I get, the more Yuu’s words feel like sophistry.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s just that I was skillfully manipulated by those beautifully adorned words. After all, it’s just about maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But even so, I find it acceptable, and maybe that’s the weakness of being in love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">At least, for that moment&mdash;&mdash;the passion in those eyes burning like marbles in a fire was mine alone in the whole world.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It was like a Queen of the Night.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a beautiful flower that blooms only for one night. The flower of Enocchi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just before blooming, the bud faces upwards and unfolds its petals while exuding a fragrance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Contrary to its glamorous appearance, its scent is so intense. Many people seem to dislike it for being too distinctive.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But once you become accustomed to that scent, it’s over.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You end up devoting all your energy to caring for the flower, all for the sake of an encounter that blooms only for a single night, just a few hours.</p>

<p class="calibre5">That fragrance is similar to a first love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Finally, I’ve come to understand that.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…It’s fine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If Yuu says so, I’m fine with being just ‘best friends.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll keep this love hidden within this Twinflower ring.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In return, I want you to give me a kind of happiness I couldn’t experience through ‘romance.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">I will win in my own way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With the chains of friendship, I won’t let you go for a lifetime.</p>
