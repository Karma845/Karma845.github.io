<h1>Chapter 5: Having Fun at the Beach with My Sister Online Wife</h1>


<p>July 17th.</p>



<p>After meeting up at Koigishi Station, we endured an hour and a half train ride until we finally arrived at Aigahama Station just past 11am.</p>



<p>As we stepped out of the bustling station, we were greeted by the dazzling sunlight. When I put on sunglasses to ease the brightness, I could feel a slight coolness in the air.</p>



<p>“You look like a secret agent.”</p>



<p>“You’d rock a black suit!”</p>



<p>Kotobuki and Aoki chuckled. They could afford to laugh since we knew each other, but any stranger seeing me would be wary. This way, no one would approach us for small talk and we could enjoy our beach day in peace.</p>



<p><em>By the way, </em>I glanced at Kotobuki’s shoulder. While we each carried a bag, she was the only one lugging a heavy cooler box.</p>



<p>“Want me to carry that?”</p>



<p>“It’s pretty heavy, are you sure?”</p>



<p>“That’s why I’m offering. Aren’t our drinks in there?”</p>



<p>Kotobuki smirked, “Can those sunglasses see through things? Oh, Fujisaki is pervy—”</p>



<p>“Don’t joke around like that or I won’t carry it.”</p>



<p>“Kidding, kidding! I’d really appreciate it if you did!”</p>



<p>When I took the cooler box, it was heavier than I expected.</p>



<p>Kotobuki spun her arms happily, “Ah, this is nice. Having a guy around is so handy. Don’t hesitate to ask if it gets too much.”</p>



<p>“I’ve got this under control.”</p>



<p>Despite her nearly 180-centimeter height, Kotobuki was still a girl. It wouldn’t be right to burden her with heavy luggage.</p>



<p>As I adjusted the shoulder strap, I could hear the excited voices of Momoi and the others.</p>



<p>“Look Kotomi-san, it’s like straight out of the anime!”</p>



<p>“It feels like we’ve stepped into Miki-chan’s world!”</p>



<p>“The accuracy is impressive!”</p>



<p>Gazing up at Aigahama Station, Takase was just as excited. Then Kotobuki and Aoki chimed in with, “Oh, it’s true,” and “This is really the setting of the anime.”</p>



<p>When Momoi mentioned the trip to Aigahama, she must had brought up anime pilgrimage too. Even though they weren’t pressured to, they watched the anime just to share in the excitement with her.</p>



<p>Naturally, I had watched<em> “Miki-chan Wants to Swim” </em>as well. I initially thought it’d be full of swimsuit scenes since it was set at the beach, but surprisingly, Miki-chan rarely wore swimsuit. She wanted to swim but was always busy with chores or helping friends.</p>



<p>While the story wasn’t filled with twists and turns, seeing Miki-chan finally swam in the last episode was cathartic. The careful depiction of family bonds and friendships kept me engaged till the end. Watching Miki-chan swam happily in the last scene made me eager to hit the beach.</p>



<p>“Aoki-san, take some pictures!”</p>



<p>“Me too, me too! Make sure the station’s in the background!”</p>



<p>“This is your moment to shine!”</p>



<p>Aoki looked for a good angle and took some photos. </p>



<p>After enjoying the excitement in front of the station, we started walking towards the beach.</p>



<p>Upon ascending the pedestrian bridge, we caught a glimpse of the sea beyond the windbreak. The beach was hidden by the trees, but with clear skies and a holiday, it was bound to be bustling with people.</p>



<p>As we descended the bridge and followed the road, we spotted a sign for Aigahama Beach. Further along, we reached the expansive parking lot.</p>



<p>Beyond the parking lot lay the sandy beach, and the smell of the sea wafted towards us. The sudden realization of being at the beach filled me with excitement.</p>



<p>But before any fun could begin, it was time to change.</p>



<p>According to the sign, the prefab hut over there served as the changing room. We crossed the parking lot and headed there.</p>



<p>“Let’s meet back there after changing,” Momoi pointed to the benches in front of the hut.</p>



<p>“Okay,” I nodded and parted ways with the girls. I followed the sign and entered the men’s changing room.</p>



<p>The humid changing room buzzed with children’s voices. After changing into my swim trunks and switching to sandals, I stepped out of the room. No one else had arrived yet.</p>



<p>I placed my bag and cooler box on the vacant bench and tentatively touched it with my hand. I hoped to find it cool to the touch since it was shielded from the direct sunlight, but the bench was moderately warm. It wasn’t scorching enough to deter sitting, but I didn’t feel tired enough to sit either. Should I wait standing?</p>



<p>I readjusted my sunglasses on my forehead and crossed my arms, waiting for the girls to arrive. Before long, a familiar figure emerged.</p>



<p>It was Aoki, clad in a frilly bikini, who hurried over as soon as she spotted me.</p>



<p>While I wasn’t particularly shy around people, being alone with Aoki felt a bit awkward. When I pondered potential conversation topics, Aoki looked up at me with her dewy eyes.</p>



<p>“You’re early.”</p>



<p>“Because I’m a guy.”</p>



<p>“Are guys always early?”</p>



<p>“I guess we tend to be faster than girls. Or is it just you, Aoki?”</p>



<p>Aoki pointed behind our shoulders with her thumb.</p>



<p>“There’s a ghost behind us.”</p>



<p>“A… a ghost?”</p>



<p>“It seems like I’ve mistaken.”</p>



<p>“Oh, uh, yeah, a joke, right?”</p>



<p>I still hadn’t quite grasped Aoki’s character. I wished she’d avoid making confusing jokes.</p>



<p>“By the way, Narumi found it amusing.”</p>



<p>“Takase laughs at everything,” I commented. She was the girl who smiled upon meeting me for the first time, after all. “Why the sudden joke, though? Is that typical of you, Aoki?”</p>



<p>“Not really. I’m just trying to lighten the mood with you, Fujisaki.”</p>



<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>“It was Momoi’s idea because she thought you would feel uncomfortable surrounded by the girls.”</p>



<p>Ah, Momoi. She did invite me to join in on the fun. But while I appreciated her consideration, I needed to set the record straight. I didn’t want to be seen as a guy who got flustered by girls in swimsuits.</p>



<p>“Thanks for looking out for me, but I’m perfectly calm.”</p>



<p>Aoki leaned in closer. Though her swimsuit didn’t reveal much cleavage, the glistening skin made me unexpectedly flustered.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010514.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“Looks like you’re getting a bit flustered.”</p>



<p>“You’re mistaken.”</p>



<p>“Your eyes are wandering.”</p>



<p>“N-no, they’re not!”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it is!”</p>



<p>“Then you should keep looking at me. Otherwise, you’ll end up feeling embarrassed, Fujisaki.”</p>



<p>“Embarrassed?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, we decided to take turns coming out because it would be too overwhelming for you if we go out all at once.”</p>



<p>Was that also Momoi’s idea? Frankly, it was a huge relief. If I were suddenly surrounded by my female classmates in swimsuits, I would’ve been too excited that I might have had a nosebleed.</p>



<p>“I see. But I’m not nervous at all… why would I end up feeling embarrassed?”</p>



<p>“Because next up is Ran.”</p>



<p>“Kotobuki…?”</p>



<p>Even with her clothes on, it was clear that Kotobuki had big breasts. Just imagining her in a swimsuit made my heart race. I should mentally prepared myself while I still could.</p>



<p>“And Ran is looking forward to teasing you.”</p>



<p><em>Is she in elementary school or what?</em></p>



<p>“Even though I carried her stuff…”</p>



<p>“Ran’s just trying to help you relax. She means no harm. But, I want you to tease her in return.”</p>



<p>“Tease her?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, like compliment her appearance. Her embarrassed expression is rare, so I want a photo for memory’s sake.”</p>



<p>Aoki raised her camera, a mischievous grin playing on her lips.</p>



<p>I responded with a smirk of my own. “Alright. Let’s team up.”</p>



<p>“You’re a good guy.”</p>



<p>Just as I formed an alliance with Aoki, another girl approached.</p>



<p>“Hey there!”</p>



<p>It was Kotobuki. Clad in a yellow bikini, her chest swayed with each step, drawing my gaze involuntarily.</p>



<p>Kotobuki smirked, “Hmm? Fujisaki, where are you looking?”</p>



<p><em>Damn. She’s teasing me like a grade-schooler. This ungrateful brat repaying the favor of carrying her stuff with insolence! Someone needs to set her straight!</em></p>



<p>“Where am I looking? I’m looking at you, Kotobuki.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Oh, right.”</p>



<p>“By the way, you look really cute in that swimsuit.”</p>



<p>“Huh?! Wh-what are you suddenly saying?”</p>



<p>She seemed taken aback, not expecting a compliment. When my gaze shifted to her bikini, she bashfully covered herself with her hands.</p>



<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>



<p>“Oh, sorry, it just suits you so well.”</p>



<p>To avoid getting too excited, I was keeping my gaze above the neck. As long as I didn’t look below, I could tease her without issue.</p>



<p>“T-that’s not… I don’t look good in it…”</p>



<p>“It suits you perfectly.”</p>



<p>“You’re probably secretly thinking I look like a gorilla, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why would I think that? …Did someone call you that before?”</p>



<p>“When I was in elementary school, by some boys.”</p>



<p>“That’s awful…”</p>



<p>With Momoi and Takase nearby, she didn’t stand out in my eyes, but Kotobuki was undeniably cute. With her good figure and natural smile, probably because of her customer service job, she was quite charming.</p>



<p>I only knew Kotobuki from middle school onwards, but at least the current her didn’t seem gorilla-like in the slightest.</p>



<p>“Was it because you wore clothes with gorilla patterns or something?”</p>



<p>“No, it was because I punched a boy who was making fun of my friend.”</p>



<p>“I see. You’re a good person.”</p>



<p>“You too. I’ve never had a guy carry my stuff before. Thanks to you, my shoulders feel lighter.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki flashed a refreshing smile before fixed her gaze on Aoki.</p>



<p>“So, why have you been pointing the camera at me?”</p>



<p>Aoki flinched. She averted her eyes and mumbled, “N-Nothing,” but her expression clearly betrayed her lie.</p>



<p>Although she seemed adept at maintaining a poker face, it appeared that wasn’t always the case.</p>



<p>“You’re trying to get Fujisaki to capture my embarrassed face again, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Who did you ask last time?”</p>



<p>“I-If I told you that, it would be the same as admitting it.”</p>



<p>Exasperated by Aoki’s flustered response, Kotobuki sighed.</p>



<p>“She asked Narumi last time. I mean, seriously, you said it suited me. That was just weird.”</p>



<p>“I may have tried to embarrass you, but I’m being honest when I said it suits you.”</p>



<p>“Don’t lie.”</p>



<p>“It’s not a lie. I really mean that. Don’t worry too much about what they said in the past. Besides, they’d change their tune if they saw you now.”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah, I guess…”</p>



<p>Kotobuki awkwardly turned away while blushing. Even though it was a perfect opportunity to take her embarrassed expression, Aoki didn’t lift her camera. Instead, she was shrinking away as if feeling scared.</p>



<p>“I don’t really care what they think of me now… Well, thanks, anyway.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… By the way, about that teasing thing earlier…”</p>



<p>“W-we can just forget about it over some juice, right?”</p>



<p>“Fine, I’ll let it slide.”</p>



<p>“Thanks… Oh, but Aoi gets the carbonation punishment.”</p>



<p>“Carbonation punishment?”</p>



<p>“I’m not fond of fizzy drinks… They make my mouth all tingly.”</p>



<p>So that’s what she’s afraid of. It was a cute punishment.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not a monster. I’ll forgive you after one sip.”</p>



<p>“Uh… Is it lightly carbonated?”</p>



<p>“Nope, fully carbonated.”</p>



<p>“…I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>Aoki slumped in resignation.</p>



<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting!”</p>



<p>A cheerful voice rang out. Takase came running over in her sandals.</p>



<p>Ohhhh! A gingham bikini! Finally, I got to see Takase in her swimsuit! Her sunny smile was dazzling even through sunglasses!</p>



<p>“Fujisaki-kun, did you wait long?”</p>



<p>“I just got here.”</p>



<p>I wanted to keep my gaze fixed on her face, but… inevitably, my eyes wandered downward. I felt a flutter of excitement when I caught a glimpse of cleavage, but at the same time, guilt washed over me.</p>



<p>While I was happy to see her in her swimsuit, I felt like I shouldn’t be looking at her that way. Because of that, my excitement waned like the ebbing tide.</p>



<p>“Huh? Aoi-chan seems a bit down. What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I got sentenced to carbonation punishment.”</p>



<p>“I see! Ran-chan caught you again!”</p>



<p>It was clear from Aoki’s despondent expression. She probably received the same punishment last time too. As the three of them chatted “And this time it’s regular carbonation…” “It’s fizzling nicely, isn’t it?” “Next time will be the strong one,” Kotomi and Momoi approached.</p>



<p>Kotomi wore the brown bikini from the other day, while Momoi opted for a black string bikini. </p>



<p>The dark color contrasted beautifully with her fair skin, and despite her toned abdomen, it still looked soft. Her thighs had just the right amount of firmness, and her chests were so prominent it seemed like they could overflow at any moment.</p>



<p>…This was dangerous. The destructive power was incredible. Even though I quickly looked away, the image was burned into my mind, and in an instant, my body began to heat up as though I was basking in direct sunlight.</p>



<p>To cool down my excitement, I slung the heavy cooler box strap over my shoulder. As it dug into my shoulder, a tingling pain shot through, and my excitement gradually began to subside.</p>



<p>Once my heart settled down, I cautiously returned my gaze to Momoi, making sure not to look below her neck. Meanwhile, Takase and the others were chatting.</p>



<p>“That swimsuit looks cute on you.”</p>



<p>“I got this from Momoi-san.”</p>



<p>“No wonder it’s so stylish!”</p>



<p>“Let me take some photos.”</p>



<p>Momoi glanced at me shyly, seemingly embarrassed.</p>



<p>Looks like she was a bit flustered seeing my exposed upper body. After knowing that I wasn’t the only one conscious of the opposite sex’s swimsuits, I felt somewhat relieved.</p>



<p>“Okay, everyone’s here now!”</p>



<p>As Takase’s voice bounced with excitement, Momoi flinched. She quickly averted her gaze from me and spoke up.</p>



<p>“All right! Now that everyone’s here, let’s get going! First things first, let’s rent some parasols! According to the info online, we can rent one for the whole day for 1,000 yen!”</p>



<p>“Can we rent beach mats too?”</p>



<p>“Yes, we can. They also offer floating rings and beach balls.”</p>



<p>“I’ve got my own beach ball!”</p>



<p>“Nice one, volleyball club member!”</p>



<p>“There’s even a beach volleyball court.”</p>



<p>“Oh yeah, I remember! They had it in an anime too! Let’s give it a shot!”</p>



<p>“Sounds good, but we need to secure our spot first. Do you know where the rental place is?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I looked it up.”</p>



<p>“You’re really thorough, good job. Since it’s a hassle dealing with change and all, I’ll handle the parasols.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll get the beach mats!”</p>



<p>“Okay, so the rest of us will rent the volleyball court.”</p>



<p>“That works. Kotomi-san, is that okay with you?”</p>



<p>Seeing Kotomi’s anxious expression, Momoi reached out to her with concern. It seemed Kotomi was feeling uneasy about playing volleyball despite being at the beach.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s fine… But I’m not good at sports, I’ll slow everyone down…”</p>



<p>When I was about to offer some words of encouragement for the expected reasons, Aoki placed her hand on Kotomi’s shoulder.</p>



<p>“No need to worry. I’m not good at sports either.”</p>



<p>“B-But..  I got a 2 in PE.”</p>



<p>“So did I.”</p>



<p>“Really!? You too, Aoki-san!?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ve never gotten anything higher than a 2.”</p>



<p>“We’re in this together!”</p>



<p>Kotomi looked ecstatic.</p>



<p>In terms of academics and athletics, they were quite similar. Having Aoki around was reassuring for Kotomi… But I did worry about their grades. They wouldn’t end up repeating a year, right?</p>



<p>With Kotomi’s worries dispelled, we headed to the beach hut to rent parasols and mats. As we left footprints in the sand with our sandals, Kotobuki chirped brightly.</p>



<p>“The ‘Fujisaki Effect’ is amazing!”</p>



<p>“Effect?”</p>



<p>“Last year, we were already being hit on by three guys at this point.”</p>



<p>“Thanks to Fujisaki-kun, today is gonna be fun!”</p>



<p>Her smile was so bright! </p>



<p>After being boosted by Takase’s enthusiasm, we arrived at the beach hut. I rented a parasol while Takase grabbed the mat, and following Momoi’s lead, we strode along the sandy shore.</p>



<p>“Are we heading towards Ariel?”</p>



<p>“In terms of direction, yes. But since it’s a restaurant, we’ll go there after having some fun.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Maho, what do we do with our stuff when we play volleyball?”</p>



<p>“The beach hut that manages the volleyball court has lockers.”</p>



<p>“Then we don’t need to lay our mats near the volleyball court, right?”</p>



<p>“Right. So… how about over there?”</p>



<p>We approached a lively spot with families nearby. Takase began spreading out the mats, and I inserted the parasol into the center where there was a hole for it. Once I made sure it was firmly planted, the girls started to relax.</p>



<p>Kotobuki took out orange juice from the cooler box and poured it into paper cups. Aoki was the only one drinking a carbonated beverage. With encouragement from Kotomi, she closed her eyes and sipped it slowly.</p>



<p>Once the parasol was set up and we settled onto the mats, Takase handed me a cup. When I happily quenched my thirst, Momoi retrieved a tube container from her bag.</p>



<p>It was a sunscreen cream. Momoi started applying it to her skin, and the others followed suit.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>It was a wholesome sight, but also a bit awkward. However, given my role as the designated ‘anti-pickup’, I couldn’t just leave. </p>



<p>“Haruto-kun, don’t you have sunscreen?”</p>



<p>“I didn’t bring any.”</p>



<p>“Did you forget?”</p>



<p>“No, I’ve just never used it. I’ve never really cared about getting a sunburn.”</p>



<p>“But it stings and hurts. Want me to lend you some?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine. It looks kinda expensive though.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. Come this way.”</p>



<p>“I said I’m fine.”</p>



<p>I managed to keep eye contact while speaking, but if I let my guard down, my gaze would inevitably drift downward. If I kept this up, I might end up staring at her cleavage again, and that wouldn’t be good.</p>



<p>Let’s try to calm down by talking to Kotomi. With that decision in mind, I turned my back to Momoi when suddenly…</p>



<p>“Hey!”</p>



<p>She lightly smacked my back.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong with you…?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t ignore it, so I turned my head to face Momoi. She grinned mischievously and said, “Now there’s a handprint on your back. If you don’t want that, put on some sunscreen.”</p>



<p>Was it just mischief or was she really worried about my skin getting sunburned? Well, knowing Momoi, she must be concerned about me.</p>



<p>“Alright, alright. Then, could you put some on my back?”</p>



<p>“Sure thing.”</p>



<p>“And make sure to rub it in properly.”</p>



<p>“I know, I know.”</p>



<p>She placed her hand on my back and began spreading the cream up and down.</p>



<p>“By the way, is this waterproof?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Wanna play in the sea first?”</p>



<p>“We did come here for the sea after all.”</p>



<p>“Aww, let’s play volleyball first, volleyball!”</p>



<p>“I’m voting for volleyball too!”</p>



<p>“If we can play in the sea, the order doesn’t matter.”</p>



<p>“I’ll go along with whatever everyone else wants.”</p>



<p>“If everyone’s in, then anything’s fine!”</p>



<p>With volleyball decided by majority vote, after finishing applying sunscreen, we grabbed our belongings and left the mats behind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>According to Momoi, the volleyball courts were located at the end of the crescent-shaped beach. Along the way, we passed by the beach house “Ariel,” where Momoi and Kotomi were excitedly chattering, but our goal was beach volleyball.</p>



<p>Since Episode 5 of “<em>Miki-chan</em>” featured a beach volleyball scene, this could be considered a pilgrimage to a sacred site and an otaku activity. Perhaps that’s why both of them quickly shook off the temptation of Ariel and resumed their walk, and before long, we arrived at the volleyball courts.</p>



<p>There were two volleyball courts available, both empty, probably due to it being lunchtime.</p>



<p>First, we paid for an hour’s rental fee, and we stored our belongings in the lockers except for the cooler box. Then, we gathered at the court.</p>



<p>“Can I touch the ball, Kotobuki-san?”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Yeah, sure.”</p>



<p>Kotomi touched the volleyball she received and her expression clouded.</p>



<p>“It’s quite hard…”</p>



<p>“If you’re scared, we can use a beach ball instead. It won’t get swept away in this breeze.”</p>



<p>Hearing that, Kotomi’s tense expression relaxed. I didn’t want the girls to feel uneasy, so I also preferred a softer ball.</p>



<p>Anyway…</p>



<p>“What about the rules?”</p>



<p>I had experience with volleyball in gym class, but I was clueless about beach volleyball. There was an episode about beach volleyball in an anime, but they never explained the rules.</p>



<p>“If the other team scores a point, we switch serves. Same person can’t serve twice or touch the ball twice in a row. And you can serve from anywhere inside the court. Other than that, let’s just have fun!”</p>



<p>With only a few rules to remember, Kotomi and Aoki, who were both bad at sports, smiled at each other in relief.</p>



<p>As Kotobuki went to fetch the beach ball from the beach house and inflated it, Momoi brought up the topic.</p>



<p>“How should we divide the teams?”</p>



<p>She looked unusually serious. I understood her feelings; team selection could greatly affect the outcome.</p>



<p>In order to enjoy volleyball to the fullest, we needed to assemble a well-balanced team.</p>



<p>“Shouldn’t Kotobuki and I be on different teams for better balance?”</p>



<p>“Good point. It’s safer if we split up, with me and Fujisaki-brother, Maho and Narumi, and Aoi and Fujisaki-sister on separate teams.”</p>



<p>“So, we’re enemies now…”</p>



<p>“But friendship is eternal!”</p>



<p>Kotomi and Aoki shook hands. It seemed like they had forged a close bond. Maybe the day would come when Kotomi joined a photography club.</p>



<p>“Fujisaki, this way.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Kotobuki motioned for me to join her. We split into tall team, agile team, and not-so-agile team, then played rock-paper to determine teams.</p>



<p>I got rock. I’d prefer not to compete directly against Takase, but let’s see how it went…</p>



<p>“Is everyone done?”</p>



<p>When Kotobuki called out, we all responded.</p>



<p>“Paper team, head to the court. </p>



<p>“Rock team, come over here.”</p>



<p>When I called out while raising my fist, Kotomi and Takase came running.</p>



<p>Alright! I was on the same team as Takase! Our bond was about to deepen!</p>



<p>“Let’s do our best!”</p>



<p>“It’s reassuring to have you with us, Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>“We’re definitely gonna win!”</p>



<p>After we pumped up our team spirit, I glanced at the opposing court, where they looked to be strategizing.</p>



<p>Aoki aside, Kotobuki was a formidable opponent. Thinking back to last year’s sports festival, Momoi couldn’t be underestimated either. While her ball skills were uncertain, her speed rivaled that of a track team ace. Anywhere we hit the ball, she’d likely pick it up in no time.</p>



<p>But it wouldn’t be fair to focus solely on Aoki… maybe we should aim for places that were harder to reach.</p>



<p>“What’s our plan?”</p>



<p>“I’ll take the front, so you two cover the back.”</p>



<p>“A strategy that makes use of your height. Let’s do our best to defend!”</p>



<p>“Yeah… but can you try not to hit it to the back too much?”</p>



<p>“I’ll try, but don’t beat yourself up if you mess up.”</p>



<p>“Neither of me nor Fujisaki-kun will get mad at you. Let’s just have fun without getting injured!”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah. I-I’ll enjoy volleyball!”</p>



<p>Kotomi, who was already bad at sports, detested team competitions. During middle school sports events, she piled mistake upon mistake, which made her feel like she didn’t fit it and often didn’t want to go to school because of it.</p>



<p>But her classmates all knew about Kotomi’s lack of athletic ability, and if they looked at her desperate face, they could see she wasn’t deliberately slacking off. Since no one was angry with her and encouraged her to attend school, Kotomi managed to avoid becoming a truant.</p>



<p>Though she still disliked physical activities, I hoped she could overcome her insecurities with this.</p>



<p>“Are you guys ready over there?”</p>



<p>Looks like their strategy session had wrapped up as Kotobuki called out from the net. The three of us headed over and I asked her;</p>



<p>“How many points per match?”</p>



<p>“25 points might tire us out too quickly. How about 15 points for now?”</p>



<p>“Sounds good.”</p>



<p>Because there was no objections, Kotobuki and I played rock-paper-scissors to determine who would serve first. I lost, so Kotobuki took the beach ball and moved to the back of the court. Momoi positioned herself diagonally ahead, while Aoki stood in the middle near the net.</p>



<p>“Aoki, are you playing upfront? Can you reach the ball?”</p>



<p>“Do I look like I can reach it?”</p>



<p>“I can’t tell. Wouldn’t it be better if you played in the back?”</p>



<p>“But then I’d get hit by the ball, that’s scarier.”</p>



<p>“It’s just plastic ball.”</p>



<p>“Scary thing is scary. I feel safer here behind the net. Besides, since you’re kind, I know you won’t spike hard against me.”</p>



<p>“You’re rattling off strategies quite easily.”</p>



<p>“I just want to feel reassured before the game. Or… are you planning to spike against me?”</p>



<p>Aoki looked visibly anxious. If it were Kotobuki upfront, I could spike without reservation, but…</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t target you. Just enjoy the volleyball game without any stress.”</p>



<p>“As expected, you’re nice.”</p>



<p>Just when Aoki feeling relieved, Kotobuki tossed the ball up and smacked it down with a satisfying thud. It soared high over the net and into the back zone.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey! Here!” Takase scooped the ball with an underhand pass.</p>



<p>“G-Got it!” Despite nearly tripping, Kotomi managed to connect with an overhand pass.</p>



<p>“Whoa! Oops!” I chased after the ball flying out of bounds and accidentally hit it with my wrist.</p>



<p>“Yes!” </p>



<p>The ball hit the referee’s stand, and Kotobuki struck a triumphant pose.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Haru-nii.”</p>



<p>When I returned to the court, Kotomi apologized.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. You did great catching up to the ball.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you managed to pass the ball without falling.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I passed it! Okay, I’ll do my best next time!”</p>



<p>Instead of scolding Kotomi, we praised her which was igniting her motivation. Meanwhile, Aoki picked up the ball that had rolled away and tossed it to Momoi.</p>



<p>“Here we go! Take this.”</p>



<p>Momoi sent an underhand serve, the ball sailed over the net towards Takase.</p>



<p>“Alright, here it comes, Kotomi-chan!”</p>



<p>“Here, Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>“Okay! Go!” </p>



<p>I lightly tapped the ball, sending it flying just past Aoki’s shoulder. Momoi barely managed to catch up, but the ball hit her wrist and flew into the adjacent court.</p>



<p>“Yes! One point for us!”</p>



<p>“Nice one, Kotomi-chan! Good job, Fujisaki-kun!”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Takase! You too, Kotomi!”</p>



<p>“Thank you!”</p>



<p>Kotomi’s face lit up with a smile. She and Takase both looked like they were having fun. Let’s keep scoring like this!</p>



<p>Aoki passed me the ball from under the net. I consulted with Takase and the others.</p>



<p>“What about the serve? Do you want to try it, Takase?”</p>



<p>“I’m okay with it, but how about giving it a shot, Kotomi-chan?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah. I’ll give it a try!”</p>



<p>Kotomi was more proactive now. We needed to score points here to boost her confidence. For that to happen, she had to nail this serve…</p>



<p>“Here goes!”</p>



<p>Kotomi sent the ball up from below. It made it to the opponent’s court, but Kotobuki was ready at the drop point.</p>



<p><em>Pong</em>, Kotobuki passed it to Momoi, who then set it up. Aoki, who had stepped back a bit, kept her eyes on the ball as it came down—</p>



<p>“Eek!”</p>



<p>She ended up hitting the net with her face. Momoi dashed over, her expression filled with concern.</p>



<p>“Aoi-chan, are you okay!?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine.”</p>



<p>“Though we’re enemies, you did great, Aoki!”</p>



<p>“Nice try, Aoi-chan!”</p>



<p>“Aoi-san, good job!”</p>



<p>Cheers came from the opposing team, and Aoki was oddly pleased. She clenched her fist, determined to catch up next time.</p>



<p>It was 2-1 now. We still had the serve, but Takase’s serve go blocked by the net. It was now 2-2.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, keep going.”</p>



<p>Aoki sent the ball over to the opponent’s court. This time, she failed with her serve. Despite leading briefly at 3-2, we quickly fell behind after Kotobuki and Aoki swapped positions and was able to score three consecutive spikes.</p>



<p>Now it was 3-5. We couldn’t afford to let them pull further ahead. While they were enjoying the game, I wanted to win. <em>And I really wanted to high-five with Takase!</em></p>



<p>“Here we go!”</p>



<p>Momoi served. The ball didn’t seem like it had much distance. I could return this with a spike.</p>



<p>“Alright—”</p>



<p>“Whoa!”</p>



<p>Suddenly, something soft collided with my back. Instinctively, I turned around to find Takase sitting on the ground.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry. Are you okay, Takase!?”</p>



<p>“Haha, I’m fine, I’m fine!”</p>



<p>“Are you sure? You didn’t hurt yourself anywhere?”</p>



<p>“No worries! I’m good, I’ve been eating plenty of meat!”</p>



<p>“How is that relevant?”</p>



<p>“Just trying to lighten the mood with a joke! Don’t worry, I’m really okay. But more importantly, good job!” </p>



<p>“Well done, Haru-nii!”</p>



<p>Their smiles put me at ease.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Takase didn’t get hurt. It would be the worst to injure the girl I liked. While I wasn’t going to hold back, I decided to play without worrying too much about winning or losing, to avoid any more collisions.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I lobbed the ball over to the opponent’s court. Momoi, still looking up, tried to catch it but stumbled, her foot caught in the sand.</p>



<p>“Ouch!”</p>



<p>Before I could ask if she was alright, Momoi cried out in pain. She sat down, rubbing her ankle.</p>



<p>It seemed serious. As we worried, we paused the game and gathered around Momoi.</p>



<p>“Sorry. Looks like I hurt my ankle.”</p>



<p>“Did you sprain it, Maho-chi?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m not sure…”</p>



<p>“Sorry, Momoi. I should have rolled the ball instead…”</p>



<p>“N-No, don’t worry.”</p>



<p>Momoi looked apologetic. She probably wanted to say it was her fault for not paying attention, but it was my fault. If I had just rolled the ball, this wouldn’t have happened.</p>



<p>“Hey, wasn’t there a hospital nearby in the anime?” Kotobuki suddenly remembered.</p>



<p>“That’s right! It was in episode seven! Momoi-san, let’s go to the hospital!”</p>



<p>“I’m fine, really. It’s not that serious… Actually, I think I can walk now.”</p>



<p>“No, Maho-chi, don’t push yourself. Even if we don’t go to the hospital, you should rest!”</p>



<p>“Narumi’s right. If you’re resting, it’s better to be in the shade, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Let’s head back to the parasol.”</p>



<p>“B-but, what if walking makes it worse…?”</p>



<p>“It’s okay. I’ll carry you.”</p>



<p>Though it was embarrassing, this situation was my fault. Even if it weren’t, I couldn’t let Momoi, who was injured, walk on her own.</p>



<p>I wrapped my arms around Momoi’s back and knees as I lifted her up. In anime and manga, they carried heroines effortlessly, but it wasn’t so easy in real life. I wouldn’t admit it out loud for pride’s sake, but Momoi was quite heavy. With her big breasts, it was only natural.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Haruto-kun.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. I won’t drop you, so just relax.”</p>



<p>“Uh, okay… Thanks…”</p>



<p>I left the cooler box to Kotobuki and headed off the court. Despite my trembling arms, we safely made it to the parasol where I gently set Momoi down on the mat.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… for interrupting the volleyball game…”</p>



<p>“Don’t apologize. No one minds.”</p>



<p>“But, it’s supposed to be a beach day… I want everyone to have fun without worrying about me…”</p>



<p>I didn’t mind it at all, but making Momoi feel responsible was unfair.</p>



<p>“I’ll take care of her. You can go play, everyone.”</p>



<p>“But… Haruto-kun, don’t you want to have fun?” </p>



<p>Momoi gazed at me through her sunglasses, her eyes showing expectations. It was clear what she was hoping. She wanted me to stay close. Probably to avoid being hit on.</p>



<p>“It’s not that I don’t want to play, but I can’t leave you alone. I came here to keep you from getting hit on.”</p>



<p>While the other girls might get hit on too since they were cute, Momoi undoubtedly attracted the most attention from guys. I felt bad for Takase and the others, but I hoped they’d decline any advances if approached.</p>



<p>“In that case, we’ll leave Maho-chi in Fujisaki-kun’s care.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. With Fujisaki around, we can relax. Let’s head to Ariel.”</p>



<p>“But it’ll be crowded since it’s lunchtime. We can’t just leave Momoi-san alone to go eat.”</p>



<p>“Of course, I’ll just making the reservation. We’ll be back soon.”</p>



<p>“It’ll take about thirty minutes, right?” </p>



<p>“Huh? It shouldn’t take that long to get to Ariel.”</p>



<p>“Well, I’m tired over here. I just wanna stroll leisurely.”</p>



<p>“And we also have to pick up our belongings from the locker.”</p>



<p>Thirty minutes seemed a bit much, but I got what Takase was hinting at. She probably wanted me to stay by Momoi’s side as her boyfriend for about thirty minutes.</p>



<p>We weren’t really dating, but Momoi seemed down. Although it was embarrassing, just for now, I needed to treat her kindly like a boyfriend would be.</p>



<p>“Take care of Maho-chi for us!”</p>



<p>After Takase and the others left, Momoi started fidgeting the moment we were alone. She sat next to me while fiddling with her toes. She was visibly restless.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll take you to Ariel.”</p>



<p>She couldn’t be nervous about being alone with me, and she probably just wanted to go to the beach house with her friends.</p>



<p>Seeing her hopeful expression, I wonder if that was the right answer.</p>



<p>“When you say you’ll take me, do you mean like earlier…?” </p>



<p>“I can’t just let you walk on your own.”</p>



<p>“But… aren’t you embarrassed? After being stared at so much…”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind. I was too focused on carrying you to worry about people’s stares.”</p>



<p>“Yeah… You were trying so hard for me…” </p>



<p>Her shy smile made me feel embarrassed too. Normally, I’d crack a joke like,<em> “I wouldn’t have had to try so hard if you were lighter,”</em> but seeing Momoi vulnerable like this, I couldn’t bring myself to say it.</p>



<p>And besides…</p>



<p>“It’s only natural that I tried so hard. It’s my fault you got hurt…”</p>



<p>“T-That’s not true! It’s not your fault!”</p>



<p>Her happy expression suddenly turned serious when she denied it. Her kindness made me smile without even realizing.</p>



<p>“Thanks. I feel better now.”</p>



<p>“P-Please don’t worry about me.”</p>



<p>Even though she said that, I couldn’t help but worry. But for her sake, I should try not to show it.</p>



<p>Anyway, the atmosphere had turned gloomy. Maybe I should bring up anime topics to lighten things up.</p>



<p>“But Ariel really felt like something out of an anime! Even the owner’s voice was straight from the anime!”</p>



<p>“That’s got to be exciting.”</p>



<p>“I’d love to sit in the same spot as Miki-chan!”</p>



<p>“We should take a commemorative photo there.”</p>



<p>Usually, Momoi would be excited about this, but she was low on energy. She said she could walk earlier at the court, but now her complexion was getting worse, as if the pain had returned.</p>



<p>“Hey, are you really okay not going to the hospital?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m fine. So please don’t worry.”</p>



<p>“You don’t look fine, though. Let’s at least ice your foot. There’s an ice pack in the cooler.”</p>



<p>“I-I’ll be okay… Really, don’t worry about me,” she murmured tearfully, placing her sunglasses on the ground and burying her face in her knees. </p>



<p>She told me not to worry, but hearing her small whimper only heightened my concern. I wanted to cheer her up somehow, but pushing her to talk would just exhaust her even more. Maybe it’d be best to leave her be for now.</p>



<p>After about five minutes, Momoi lifted her head. Still looking gloomy, she gazed at me with anxious eyes.</p>



<p>“U-Um, there’s something I need to tell you… Can you promise not to hate me?”</p>



<p>“Did you do something to make me hate you?”</p>



<p>“…I did.”</p>



<p>Was her poor complexion because of that? Even if she said so, I couldn’t recall anything… </p>



<p>“I won’t hate you. Just tell me.”</p>



<p>She nodded uncertainly and was about to speak when a beach ball rolled over. Before I could pick it up, Momoi grabbed it and walked toward the child.</p>



<p>“Here!”</p>



<p>“Thanks, <em>onee-chan</em>!”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome!”</p>



<p>When Momoi turned to face me, her expression grew even more somber. She sat down beside me and awkwardly spoke in a soft voice.</p>



<p>“…As you can see.”</p>



<p>“As I can see…? Does that mean your leg is healed?” </p>



<p>That was the only conclusion I could draw from the current situation. But Momoi shook her head.</p>



<p>“It’s not that… I wasn’t injured from the beginning.”</p>



<p>I didn’t understand.</p>



<p>I was used to Kotomi and her feigned illnesses, but she always had reasons like <em>“I want to play games”</em> or <em>“I don’t want to go to the sports festival” </em>or <em>“I hate exams.”</em></p>



<p>But Momoi’s situation had no apparent reason. At least none that I could think of. She was in the middle of enjoying the otaku activity with her dear friends, so why would she pretend to be injured?</p>



<p>“Didn’t you enjoy beach volleyball?”</p>



<p>“It was fun, but…”</p>



<p>“…But what?”</p>



<p>Reluctantly, Momoi lowered her gaze and then looked at me with embarrassment.</p>



<p>“To tell you the truth, I actually liked your team better.”</p>



<p>“Did you have a fight with Kotobuki or Aoi?”</p>



<p>They seemed to be having a good time on their own… was she just acting cheerful to keep the atmosphere light?</p>



<p>“No, I’ve never fought with Ran-chan or Aoi-chan.”</p>



<p>“Then why did you prefer our team? There wasn’t even a difference in strength.”</p>



<p>If anything, Momoi’s team had the advantage. I might be taller, but Kotobuki was the ace of the volleyball team. And while they both were athletic, Momoi was ten centimeters taller than Takase. That much was clear from the score of 3-5.</p>



<p>“It’s not about strength…”</p>



<p>Momoi struggled to explain. When our eyes met, she instinctively looked away, then muttered shyly.</p>



<p>“Because… I felt lonely without you. I thought if I pretended to be injured, I could get your attention like Naru-chan…”</p>



<p>Before she could finish, Momoi buried her face in her knees.</p>



<p><em>She pretended to be injured to get my attention, huh? </em>Looking back, I’ve had similar experiences. When my parents paid more attention to Kotomi, I sometimes misbehaved just to get noticed.</p>



<p>It was supposed to be actions born out of loneliness and jealousy. If Momoi was the same as I was back then, it meant she was jealous too. And there was only one reason to be jealous of seeing me getting along with another girl.</p>



<p>The moment I realized the reason, my face flushed with heat.</p>



<p>“S-So, Momoi… do you… like me?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s not like that.”</p>



<p><em>Not like that?! Don’t toy with me with such suggestive words! I totally jumped the gun! Damn, this is embarrassing!</em></p>



<p>“I just think that if I were to date someone, I’d prefer it to be you, Haruto-kun.”</p>



<p>“Is that because I’m an otaku?”</p>



<p>Sure, my knowledge of anime, manga, and games had expanded over the past few months, but that didn’t make me a full-blown otaku. And Momoi’s fondness for me was mostly due to what Kotomi had built up. So even if she harbored feelings for me, it wasn’t something I would be happy about. All I felt would be guilt.</p>



<p>“It’s not because you’re an otaku. I like your personality.”</p>



<p>“My personality?”</p>



<p>“You’re kind, but you also stand your ground, don’t you? Like calling underwear ‘pants’, or being ruthless in games, or referring to my sunglasses collection as ‘weird shapes’.”</p>



<p><em>Did she hold a grudge over that ‘weird shapes’ comment…?</em></p>



<p>“My bad for saying ‘weird shapes’.”</p>



<p>“I’m not mad or anything. Actually, it’s part of what makes you, you.”</p>



<p>“But, don’t girls prefer a guy who’s kind over one who talks back?”</p>



<p>“Of course, being treated kindly is nice, but it’s tiring when someone holds back to avoid upsetting me. It makes me feel like I have to be careful too. That’s exhausting.”</p>



<p>“Are you saying you don’t get tired around me?”</p>



<p>She nodded.</p>



<p>“With you, I feel relaxed and just talking with you is fun. Whether you’re an otaku or not doesn’t matter.”</p>



<p>Momoi wasn’t enamored with “Jet Black Yasha” but with “Fujisaki Haruto.” She liked my personality.</p>



<p>“Do you… like me, Haruto-kun?”</p>



<p>If that had been a confession, I’d be at a loss for words, but Momoi wasn’t confessing her love for me. It’d be better to give a clear answer now to avoid awkwardness later on.</p>



<p>“I like you as a person, but I don’t have any romantic feelings for you.”</p>



<p>Since I’d originally made it clear that I wasn’t in love with her, she accepted my words without much fuss. Then, probing further, she asked, “By the way… have you ever felt flustered around me?”</p>



<p>“…No.”</p>



<p>Momoi narrowed her eyes suspiciously.</p>



<p>“There was a weird pause just now. Oh, could it be you got flustered seeing me in a swimsuit?”</p>



<p>“I didn’t.”</p>



<p>“Then look.”</p>



<p>“Fine, fine… Alright, I’m looking. But I didn’t get flustered.”</p>



<p>“Take off your sunglasses.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because you don’t seem like you’re really looking.”</p>



<p>Indeed, I was avoiding. Taking off my sunglasses would expose my true reaction, but leaving them on would imply that I did feel something.</p>



<p>Reluctantly, I removed my sunglasses. Momoi stood up, facing me in seiza style. My heart started pounding as her ample bosom swayed in front of me. My body heated up instantly, and I could feel my face turning red.</p>



<p>On her end, she looked nervous too. Her breathing was heavy, her chest rising and falling with each breath. Seeing the sweat trickle down her cleavage only made my heart race faster.</p>



<p>“…Want to touch?”</p>



<p>“W-What are you saying!?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you want to touch me?”</p>



<p>“It’s not about wanting to or not! We’re not even dating, so why would I touch you!”</p>



<p>“Then why don’t we date?”</p>



<p>Momoi said it lightly, but it didn’t seem like a joke. There was a seriousness in her gaze.</p>



<p>“But we’ve both said we don’t have romantic feelings for each other, right?”</p>



<p>“But we like each other as people, don’t we? So I think it’s okay to date. …Or is there someone else you like?”</p>



<p>“T-That’s none of your business!”</p>



<p>“Oh, so you do have someone.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t say that!”</p>



<p>“You’re not denying it, which means there is. Besides, there’s no way you wouldn’t fall for me if you didn’t have one.”</p>



<p>“Your confidence never changes…”</p>



<p>“I’m quite popular, after all. So, who do you like among our classmates? Aoi-chan? Iguchi-san? Uno-san? Eto-san?”</p>



<p>“Stop listing them in alphabetical order.”</p>



<p>“Your panic confirms it’s someone from our class, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>“You’d make a great interrogator…”</p>



<p>The more I tried to deflect, the closer she got to the truth. I sighed in resignation.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I do have someone I like.”</p>



<p>“There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s healthy,” she reassured with a smile, but then her expression turned serious, “Hey, can I ask you a hypothetical question?”</p>



<p>“A hypothetical question?”</p>



<p>“Let’s say, if the girl you like and I both got injured, who would you rush to help first?”</p>



<p>“Don’t ask such tricky questions…”</p>



<p>Momoi grinned at my hesitation.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re troubled by it? Normally, you’d rush to help the girl you like, right? Or were you being considerate of me?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. It’s like asking ‘<em>who would you save, your wife or your child?</em>‘ Even without romantic feelings, you’re still important to me.”</p>



<p>Though I couldn’t give a definitive answer, she looked satisfied with my response. She smiled contentedly and said, “Alright then, I’m done,” as if she had achieved her goal.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because we had talked quite a bit, or maybe because I’d conveyed how important she was to me, but her loneliness had gradually vanished.</p>



<p>There was about fifteen minutes left until Kotomi and the others returned. Now might be a good time to bring it up.</p>



<p>“I have a favor to ask of you, Momoi.”</p>



<p>“A favor?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I want to get it done before Kotomi and the others get back.”</p>



<p>“And that is…”</p>



<p>A blush appeared on Momoi’s cheeks.</p>



<p>As I was checking to make sure no one was nearby, she lowered her voice and asked, “Is this something you can’t do in front of everyone else?”</p>



<p>“We’d have to explain if we were seen. I want it to be our little secret.”</p>



<p>Momoi’s face flushed even deeper. Squirming a bit, she looked up at me with a shy gaze.</p>



<p>“Do you… want to touch?”</p>



<p>“Let me touch.”</p>



<p>“Will you be gentle?”</p>



<p>“I can’t guarantee that.”</p>



<p>“R-right. Well… okay. I wanted to thank you for bringing me here, so…”</p>



<p>“Close your eyes.”</p>



<p>“W-why?”</p>



<p>“It’s hard to touch you when you’re looking.”</p>



<p>“O-okay.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010550.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p>Momoi’s face turned crimson as she tightly shut her eyes. I took aim at her forehead and flicked it lightly.</p>



<p>“Hya!? W-what? Why did you flick my forehead!?”</p>



<p>Her eyes widened in surprise as she looked at me bewildered.</p>



<p>“That’s a punishment for worrying your friends. Did it hurt?”</p>



<p>“N-no. It was more like… too weak to be considered punishment…”</p>



<p>“You must have been super nervous because you thought I was going to touch your chest. That’s also part of your punishment. And hey, don’t get too jealous from now on, alright? Even if were to date someone, my desire to hang out with you won’t change.”</p>



<p>I said it with sincerity, hoping to prevent this situation from happening again. Momoi looked up at me with a sweet, pleading gaze.</p>



<p>“Then… will you continue doing otaku activities with me?”</p>



<p>“Of course. I’ve got plenty of free time. I’ll join you in whatever you want to do!”</p>



<p>At my words, Momo’s face lit up with a radiant smile as though all her worries had melted away.</p>
