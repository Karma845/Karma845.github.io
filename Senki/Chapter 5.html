<h1>Chapter 5: Is It Okay to Be Supported By My Oshi?</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“(Ah, Kei-kun? Today’s stream was amazing as always!)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“(Yeah. I’m sure Ketaro’s fanbase have grown even more after this.)”  (Serika)</p>



<p>“(…Sana wants to attract more Onii-chan believers.)” (Sana)</p>



<p>One night, we were having a voice chat in our messaging group.</p>



<p>Previously, our interactions were all through text, but recently, Sana had also joined the group. Perhaps because of that, we transitioned to voice chatting and that became the norm.</p>



<p id="no1">“(You know, I’ve been thinking for a while now, but Kei-kun’s streams are just too precious. Despite that, there’s no way to express gratitude for that preciousness. So, I have a suggestion. Kei-kun should enable <a href="#footnote">superchat<sup>1</sup></a> and allow people to donate!)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“(Heh~ Yukina Nozomi, you’re onto something. I completely agree with that. Ketaro’s streams deserve more appreciation.)” (Serika)</p>



<p>“(…Agreed. Superchat is a good idea.)” (Sana)</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, hey, hold on a second…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>The main topic of our voice chat session today was the stream that I had just ended a moment ago.</p>



<p>Despite just starting the voice chat, the conversation was already moving ahead without me.</p>



<p>“(So, Kei-kun, can you set up superchats?)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“(You’re already monetized, right? Make sure it’s set up by the next stream.)” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Nono, I can’t just accept money from everyone…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“(…It’s normal for fans to donate to their oshi. If onii-chan hesitates, then Sana will go to onii-chan’s room right now and set it up.)” (Sana)</p>



<p>Sana said something outrageous, and Yuki and Serika praised her for it.</p>



<p>In the end, despite my reluctance, I was somewhat forcibly made to set up superchat.</p>



<p>But still, these three are always supporting me, and the more they push me like this, the stronger my desire becomes to do even better. It’s not exactly peer pressure, but more of a feeling that I need to meet their expectations even more.</p>



<p>“(…Kei-kun, are you okay?)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>While I was lost in thought, Yuki suddenly asked me that.</p>



<p>“What do you mean.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“(I-I mean, you seemed a bit down…)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Oh, no, it’s nothing. Probably just your imagination.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I answered like that. Maybe she sensed that I was a bit uneasy, but it wasn’t anything to be really worried about.</p>



<p>“(Is something bothering you? Did you not get an SSR in a gacha or something?)” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Like that would happen. Oh, but if I don’t get a rare skin in LoF, it’s a different story.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Come to think of it, onii-chan, you seem a bit off lately.” (Sana)</p>



<p>“…Really?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I hadn’t realized it, but was I really starting to lose my composure?</p>



<p>“It’s nothing. It’s just that I didn’t get an SSR from a gacha game.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“(You just said it wasn’t that! If it’s because of an adult-themed mobile game, I won’t go easy on you!)” (Serika)</p>



<p>“Don’t just assume things! That’s not it at all!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“(…It’s okay. The mobile games onii-chan plays are rated for ages 15 and up.)” (Sana)</p>



<p>“You promised not to say that, Sana-san!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I feel like I’m taking unnecessary damage, but it was kind of a relief that the conversation veered off track.</p>



<p>After that, the topic continued to change, and a debate erupted about gacha games.</p>



<p>“(……)” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Amidst the conversation, Yuki alone remained silent, tilting her head slightly, and there seemed to be a shadow of unease on her face.</p>



<p>===</p>



<p>The next day, at school.</p>



<p>I noticed something unusual. Yuki seemed off.</p>



<p>At first glance, she appeared to be chatting with friends as usual, but upon closer look, I could tell her mind was elsewhere. Oh, look, even now her friend is asking, “Yuki, are you listening?”</p>



<p>And her expression seemed somewhat tense. It’s not just that she seems tense, but also somewhat gloomy…?</p>



<p>It seems like the others haven’t noticed. Maybe Yuki is being careful not to attract anyone’s attention. As a dedicated Yuki fan, I can pick up on these things perfectly… Well, I don’t really know the exact cause, though.</p>



<p>Hmm, it’s bothering me. No, it’s worrying me. I wonder if something happened.</p>



<p>Speaking of strange, she’s been making a lot of eye contact with me lately. Despite being in the middle of conversations with her friends, she keeps throwing glances over here. Because of that, even though I’m a pro at averting my gaze at the last moment to avoid being noticed, I keep making eye contact with her. …Man, saying that out loud, I sound really creepy. I’ll try not to look at Yuki for a while…</p>



<p>Despite trying not to worry about it, Yuki’s behavior remained unchanged, and she continued acting like this throughout the day.</p>



<p>After school, I finally decided to ask Yuki if something was wrong. Normally, I try to avoid initiating conversations due to wanting to maintain a certain distance, but I can’t keep silent any longer.</p>



<p>…Come to think of it, Yuki usually initiates contact with me quite actively, but today she hasn’t done that at all. Now that I think about it, that’s also quite unusual. Could it be that she stopped being my fan…? While harboring such slightly negative thoughts, I waited for the moment when there were no people around Yuki and called out to her as she was leaving.</p>



<p>“Um… Yuki?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ah, K-Kei-kun? What is it?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yup, something’s wrong. She seems suspicious… or maybe uneasy.</p>



<p>After pondering for a moment, I decided to ask straightforwardly.</p>



<p>“It seemed like something was off with you today. Did something happen?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Ah, so you noticed?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki responded with a somewhat sheepish smile to my question. From her reaction, it didn’t seem like her troubles were too serious, which relieved me for the time being.</p>



<p>But still, something was indeed bothering her, so I cautiously asked about it.</p>



<p>Yuki fidgeted for a while but eventually spoke up.</p>



<p>“Well, you see, I was worried because it seemed like Kei-kun wasn’t feeling well during the voice chat yesterday… Kei-kun said it was nothing, but I couldn’t stop worrying, so I’ve been agonizing over whether to ask directly.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Uh…? So, does that mean you’ve been worrying about me this whole time?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As I said that, Yuki nodded bashfully. …So, she’s an angel after all!</p>



<p>“Well, with how you were acting today, I was worried about you too.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh, so does that mean Kei-kun was worried about me worrying about him?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Realizing this, we were both initially dumbfounded, but soon we both burst out laughing. What are we even doing?</p>



<p>“…Can we talk while we walk?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After we finished laughing, Yuki suggested this, so we left the classroom.</p>



<p>As we walked slowly down the hallway, I patiently waited for Yuki to speak.</p>



<p>“…Starting tomorrow, I have a live performance in a different region for a few days. That’s why I won’t be able to come to school, and I won’t be able to see you either.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After a while, Yuki began speaking as if talking to herself.</p>



<p>I was already aware of her regional live performances. I keep track of all of Yuki’s publicly announced schedules after all. It’s just what a dedicated fan does, but unfortunately, as a high school student, I can’t attend all of her live performances. Being a high school student is inconvenient both financially and position-wise. Of course, being a working adult is probably even tougher.</p>



<p>“Is that also the reason why you seemed off today?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah, but I think the main reason is you, Kei-kun. Even though you say you’re okay, you just didn’t seem like your usual self… Remember when we all went to the game café together recently, and you uploaded that video? There were some weird comments on it, and I thought maybe you were affected by it.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I felt happy that she noticed even such small details. At the same time, I wondered if the pressure of doing better in my streams was showing outwardly without me even realizing it.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. Besides, maybe even feeling down is just in my head.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Anyway, I answered with a smile. I didn’t want to make Yuki worry unnecessarily.</p>



<p>“…Yeah.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>However, Yuki’s response seemed somewhat lackluster.</p>



<p>Is she still worried about something…? As I pondered this, Yuki’s cheeks somehow flushed slightly, and she began to fidget as if she wanted to say something.</p>



<p>“Um, there’s something I want to ask you…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>With a sudden surge of determination, she opened her mouth and said that.</p>



<p>“What is it? Of course, if there’s anything I can do, just tell me. I’ll do my best even if it’s something I can’t do.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I encouraged her, Yuki seemed to relax a bit but still fidgeted for a while before finally speaking. </p>



<p>“Um…! C-Can I come over to your house from now on…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, upon hearing her request, I couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.</p>



<p>…Wait, what? If I heard correctly, Yuki just said she wanted to come to my house, right…?</p>



<p>Th-That’s, um, problematic. It’s problematic in so many ways.</p>



<p>Having a popular idol like her come to my house so casually, it’s like a scary super rare event of my life. My heart is pounding like crazy. </p>



<p>As someone who values the distance between a fan and an idol, this is something I can’t just overlook. I’ve been kind of lenient about it until now, but crossing this line seems really dangerous. Not in a weird way, but it’s just too close for comfort.</p>



<p>“No, um, that’s…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>So, I thought about refusing. It felt like tearing up a winning lottery ticket with my own hands. Yes, the internal struggle was that intense. But still, thinking about what’s best for my oshi, I felt that I had to refuse this.</p>



<p>“…No?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>But that expression again. It’s the forsaken puppy eyes.</p>



<p>…Why does she have to make such a helpless, pitiful expression!? How does she naturally evoke this protective instinct in me!? Is she some kind of devil!? An angel and a devil combined!? Is Yuki actually a fallen angel!? …No, that’s Mariel-sama’s domain; Yuki is undoubtedly a genuine angel! In other words, angels can sometimes be devils too! A new theory is born!</p>



<p>“…Um, it’s okay. Sure, yes…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>My mind was a mess, but before I knew it, I had agreed.</p>



<p>It couldn’t be helped. It really couldn’t. There was no way I could refuse Yuki’s request from the start.</p>



<p>It’s all because Yuki is just too adorable. It’s the fault of her being too cute. There’s no way someone like me can stand against an embodiment of the concept of cuteness.</p>



<p>“Really!? Thank you so much! I’m glad…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Look at that radiant smile. There’s no way I can win. The desire to see my oshi happy is irreplaceable. However, it doesn’t mean I’ve abandoned my principles. I still need to maintain a steel will to ensure I don’t cross certain lines.</p>



<p>…Well, the problem is that this line has been steadily lowering.</p>



<p>We left the school gate and headed towards my house. Yuki was in high spirits, talking happily about things like “I wonder what Kei-kun’s house is like”, “I need to remember the direction”, and “Oh, I have to make sure to greet your family properly” among other things.</p>



<p>By the way, both my parents are out for work, so there’s no need to worry about the last part. But at the same time, that situation could pose its own set of problems, so I could only hope that Sana is home today.</p>



<p>“…By the way, why my house? Is there a reason(Keitaro)</p>



<p>After walking for a while and regaining my composure, I asked this important question.</p>



<p>Even though Yuki is my oshi, she wouldn’t just come to my house without any reason…right?</p>



<p>“Huh? W-Well, um… it’s a secret for now. I’ll tell you when we get there.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki replied while putting her index finger to her lips.</p>



<p>Well, setting aside the fact that she’s cute… What could she mean by “it’s a secret”?</p>



<p>I was curious, but I couldn’t dwell on it too much. In fact, there was another important matter to pay attention to in this situation, so I had to allocate my mental resources there.</p>



<p>The main concern was the eyes of those around us. After all, bringing an idol to my house required the utmost caution. It would be problematic if someone saw Yuki entering my house. If, by any chance, someone from school caught sight of it, rumors would undoubtedly spread. I couldn’t let Yuki get involved in any trouble like that, so I had to be constantly vigilant.</p>



<p>…Try not to stand out, try not to stand out, but still keep an eye on our surroundings…!</p>



<p>“Huh? What’s up, Kei-kun? You’re looking around so much. You’re standing out a lot, you know?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…Ah, sorry about that.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Today’s lesson: Amateurs should avoid doing things they’re not used to.</p>



<p>…But what can I do!? Of course, I have to be cautious!</p>



<p>I scolded myself for my carelessness while trying to adjust my behavior to act normally.</p>



<p>But then, something suspicious caught my eye, and tension ran through my entire body.</p>



<p>“Huh? Kei-kun? What’s wrong, why did you stop?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki still seemed unaware, but there was definitely a suspicious man ahead. He looked like a typical photographer with a large camera hanging from his neck, constantly scanning the area as if searching for something. He hadn’t noticed us yet, but…</p>



<p>“…Ah.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I involuntarily gasped as I remembered something.</p>



<p>There’s a journalist from a weekly magazine aiming for a scoop on Yuki. I heard rumors at school that he’s been lurking around this area recently.</p>



<p>I don’t remember where I heard it from. I don’t have acquaintances who would talk about such things, so I must have overheard someone talking about it by chance. But I remember the rumor itself vividly.</p>



<p>…This is bad! That guy over there must be the one! No ordinary person would dress like that! And I can already see his camera!</p>



<p>I panicked and looked around frantically. If Yuki and I were caught together in a photo, it wouldn’t be a laughing matter. Is there anywhere, anywhere at all, we could hide…!?</p>



<p>As I scanned the surroundings, a certain sign caught my eye.</p>



<p>…That’s a manga cafe! That’s our only option, we have to go in there!</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah, Kei-kun!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I grabbed Yuki’s hand and dashed into the shop. Yuki let out a surprised noise, but I couldn’t afford to pay attention to that right now. I was only thinking about hiding as quickly as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>After swiftly registering at the reception, we entered a private room. There, I could finally catch my breath. My tense body relaxed, and I let out a big sigh.</p>



<p>“Um… why are we suddenly here?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki, who had been quietly following me until then, finally asked the question. …She’s really an angel for just letting it go like that for so long. Actually, considering the situation, I feel like I’ve done something really messed up…</p>



<p>“Ah, well… Actually—” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>As I was about to explain the situation, I stopped myself at the last moment.</p>



<p>I didn’t want to burden Yuki with unnecessary worries. Especially since she’s already dealing with the upcoming regional live starting tomorrow, I couldn’t afford to add to her mental stress by telling her that a reporter had been lurking around looking for her.</p>



<p>“Um… well, actually, I just remembered that it’s not a good time to go to my house right now. You see, um… my dad is bedridden!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Really!? Is your dad feeling unwell!? Shouldn’t we go visit him—” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s not like that! He just drank too much. My old man’s really something, always causing trouble with his drinking. Hahaha!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>So, I decided to sacrifice my dad for this. Anyway, I couldn’t possibly bring Yuki home while there’s a photographer lurking around.</p>



<p>…Even though my dad doesn’t drink or smoke. It’s all for the sake of my idol, I’m sorry…</p>



<p>“I just remembered it out of the blue, so I thought we could hang out here instead. …Um, sorry for the sudden change of plans.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It was a lame excuse, but desperate times call for desperate measures. When I explained it like that, Yuki accepted it without question, but I still felt really bad about it.</p>



<p>“Then it can’t be helped, right? This is actually my first time in a net cafe.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki, who was looking around the private room with curiosity, suddenly seemed to notice something. Her face turned red for some reason, and she started sending glances my way.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Um… it’s just that, being in a net cafe together after school feels kind of like a date…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>And with that sudden bombshell statement, I felt like my blood vessels were about to burst from my head.</p>



<p>A-A-A date!? I mean, sure, now that she mentions it, the situation does kind of give off that vibe, but…! Th-there’s no way Yuki and I could be, um, having a date! I mean, that’s just not possible, right!?</p>



<p>“Oh! S-sorry! I just blurted out what I was thinking…! I mean, there’s no way I could go on a date with Kei-kun, right…!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s the opposite!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Wh-what are you saying!? Clearly, the order is supposed to be reversed! It’s me who’s supposed to be incapable of going on a date with Yuki! I mean, first of all, this isn’t even a date, okay!?</p>



<p>We both turned bright red and looked down in embarrassment. The atmosphere around us felt incredibly awkward and, well, my head felt like it was going to boil.</p>



<p>“R-right! I-I have something I want to give you, Kei-kun… Here, take this.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>In the midst of that, Yuki spoke up with a bright voice, as if she were trying to change the subject, and handed me a paper bag from her bag. Though her face was still a little red, it’s best not to dwell on it too much.</p>



<p>“Um, what’s this?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>The paper bag she handed me was light, and it made a faint rustling sound. When I asked about its contents, Yuki just chuckled shyly and said, “Open it and see.”</p>



<p>“Are these… cookies?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Inside were rounded cookies emitting a delightful aroma. Upon closer look, I noticed they were chocolate chip cookies, with bits of chocolate sprinkled around.</p>



<p>“F-Feel free to eat it.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Y-yeah, thank you. But, why did you give me this?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Well, I actually planned to give it to you when I visited your house… I thought it might cheer you up a bit… ehehe.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Huh? S-so, this is… for me…?</p>



<p>Yuki went out of her way to give me cookies to cheer me up…?</p>



<p>…W-W-Wait a minute! Why does my heart feel all fluttery!?</p>



<p>Is it okay to be this happy!? Am I unknowingly cashing out all my luck!?  Or worse, am I going to drown in debt from the amount of happiness I’m receiving!? And on top of that, these are from my oshi—</p>



<p>“I-I see, why chocolate chip cookies, though?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Because, well, it’s Kei-kun’s favorite— …Huh!? M-Maybe I was wrong!? I’m so sorry…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“N-No, you’re right, it is my favorite! But how did you know?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Of course, I would know. You mentioned it yourself during your stream, didn’t you? There is no way I would forget something from your stream!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Y-You remember everything? Really…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Of course! By the way, you mentioned liking chocolate chip cookies during the 12th LoF livestream, around 1 hour, 38 minutes, and 23 seconds in. It was right when you were waiting for the border to close, and at that moment, the damage you dealt was—” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Too much detail! Even the damage count!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki proudly retorts to my rebuttal, but seriously, that’s way too detailed…!</p>



<p>…But come to think of it, I do vaguely remember saying that. I always try to avoid silence during my streams. As someone who calls themselves a commentator, I decided from the start to keep the commentary going, even if there are zero viewers.</p>



<p>But well, of course, there aren’t always endless topics to talk about. There’s nothing to commentate during waiting times like when the border is closing. So, at such times, I talk about irrelevant things just to keep the conversation going, and I do vaguely remember mentioning my favorite snack.</p>



<p>…And Yuki remembered even such a casual remark.</p>



<p>Not only did she remember, but she also went out of her way to do something so heartwarming…!</p>



<p>“…Thank you for this.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I take a cookie from the bag and try it. The crisp texture and the sweet taste of the dough and chocolate spread throughout my mouth. It’s so delicious it makes me want to cry.</p>



<p>“…How is it? Does it suit your taste, Kei-kun…?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“It’s really delicious. Seriously, it’s amazing.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“I’m glad…! I made it in a hurry, but I’m glad it turned out well.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>…Huh!? T-This was homemade by Yuki!?</p>



<p>Eating your favorite snack made by your oshi is like a dream come true!</p>



<p>The delicious chocolate chip cookie was the epitome of perfection, and I savored each bite, engraving it into my memory as much as possible. At the same time, a question that has been on my mind for a long time floats to the surface.</p>



<p>It’s something I’ve always wanted to ask. Perhaps now is the opportunity.</p>



<p>“…Um, Yuki, why do you support me so much?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>It’s quite a silly question. You don’t really need a reason to support your oshi. Just because you ‘like’ them is good enough.</p>



<p>“Huh? Well, of course, it’s because I like you… Ah!? N-No, not in a weird way! I-I’m not thinking of such things!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>No, I’m the one feeling awkward here, you know? …Anyway, Yuki’s answer was as straightforward as it could be. It’s a question that doesn’t even need to be asked.</p>



<p>Certainly, that’s true. It’s a matter that can be summed up in just one word. …But, while the reason might be that simple, the catalyst behind it is not. Something must have happened for her to start supporting me.</p>



<p>I felt the same way. There was a catalyst for why I started supporting Yuki. So, there should be one for her too. Asking about it was definitely crossing some boundaries, but I couldn’t help but ask. After all, this homemade chocolate chip cookie was so delicious that it temporarily blew away any reservations I had.</p>



<p>“Sorry, but… I wanted to know what made you start supporting me.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“How it started?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Yeah. I have a reason why I started supporting you, so, I wondered if you had something similar… Oh, of course, you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“H-How Kei-kun started supporting me!? I-I want to know!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s nothing much, really…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Still, I want to know! I’ll tell you mine, so is it okay if I ask about yours too?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>When I nodded, Yuki cheered softly and then sat down in her chair.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I realized I had been standing the whole time, so I took a seat as well.</p>



<p>“My catalyst was… um, it’s a little embarrassing to say. But, I first learned about Kei-kun when I was feeling down.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Feeling down… Is that something you’re okay with sharing? Of course, I won’t tell anyone.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s not that big of a deal. It’s just that when I first learned about you, I was starting to feel anxious about my idol activities.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki started speaking in a casual tone, but right from the start, I was surprised.</p>



<p>…Yuki feeling anxious about her idol activities? I’ve never heard such a thing before.</p>



<p>The genius diva feeling anxious…?</p>



<p>“Hey, what’s wrong, Kei-kun?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…N-nothing. Sorry, I didn’t mean to bring up such a heavy topic…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s not like that! It’s not as heavy as it sounds, really! It’s just that I started feeling a bit overwhelmed by the responsibilities of being an idol.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s a really heavy topic, though!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Yuki was smiling, but her words were undeniably heavy.</p>



<p>Yet, she didn’t seem to feel that way herself, continuing in a genuinely light tone.</p>



<p>“I really, really love singing. It’ll sound weird coming from me, but I feel like I was born to sing. Another thing I happen to love is dancing.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>In a quiet tone, with a hint of her usual coolness returning, Yuki looked up at the sky as if recalling the past.</p>



<p>“When I was asked if I wanted to become an idol and I expressed my desire to sing, the producer said they could make it happen for me, so I trusted them and joined [Angel]. True to their word, I’ve been given ample opportunities to sing, and I’ve genuinely felt grateful for becoming an idol. I owe a lot to the producer.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As if reminiscing about that time, Yuki’s expression softened into a faint smile.</p>



<p>“At first, I was just thrilled to sing and have everyone listen to me, so I threw myself into idol activities without thinking about the details. It was incredibly fulfilling. …Of course, I still feel that way now.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…But?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“But things changed. Not because of how others reacted, but because of myself.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>For the first time, Yuki’s expression clouded slightly.</p>



<p>“The activities were going smoothly, and [Angel] was gaining popularity. …But one day, I started to notice the increasing popularity and was becoming gradually uneasy.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Uneasy…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Before live performances and such, I started feeling more and more nervous. It wasn’t the kind of nervousness I felt at the beginning, like ‘Can I do well?’… It was more like… How can I put it… I started wondering if things were really okay the way they were.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>The moment I heard those words, my body reacted with a twitch.</p>



<p>“That’s… what do you mean by that…?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Well, I can’t explain it well myself. But even though I started this because I loved it, I started wondering if it’s okay to have so many fans supporting me. I mean, I’m just doing what I love. But to receive so much praise and admiration for my singing, it makes me happy, but I started questioning if it’s okay.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“But you know,” Yuki continued, a gentle smile returning to her face. </p>



<p>“That’s when I discovered you, Kei-kun. Watching your streams made that nervousness and unease disappear… And before I knew it, I like you. That was the beginning of me becoming your fan.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki finished speaking with a bashful smile.</p>



<p>However, I was unusually unable to admire that cuteness because of what Yuki just said…</p>



<p>“…It’s the same thing I’m feeling right now…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh, what do you mean?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>When Yuki heard the whisper that slipped out unintentionally, she leaned forward eagerly. I hurriedly shut my mouth, but it was too late. Yuki looked straight at me, her gaze unwavering.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun, there’s something bothering you, isn’t there? Is that why you seemed down recently?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“It’s not really a big deal…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“It might not be a big deal… but there’s still something bothering you, right? If so, I want to know. Just like how you’ve helped me, I want to be there for you, too.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I tried to deflect, but I couldn’t help but fall silent at her words.</p>



<p>Yuki was serious. Her genuine desire to help me came through loud and clear, and it shook me to the core. This was typical of her. She had a way of effortlessly breaking through people’s defenses. At this point, I couldn’t resist anymore. Was this the weakness of being a fan?</p>



<p>“…Don’t expect too much.”  (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I found myself saying this before I even realized it.</p>



<p>Knowing that Yuki had similar worries certainly played a part, but honestly, I was just genuinely happy about Yuki’s feelings. In front of such an angel, a human can’t help but confess the truth.</p>



<p>So I spoke. But to be honest, it wasn’t some earth-shattering dilemma.</p>



<p>I was a small-time game streamer with single-digit subscribers, and suddenly I went viral, gaining popularity. I started feeling a vague anxiety about whether I could continue to live up to that popularity… That’s all.</p>



<p>However, there is also the situation of becoming popular through the support of a certain popular idol, VTuber, and cosplayer, who I also happen to be a fan of. It adds weight to even the smallest concerns. Now, even minor worries feel heavier when you feel like you have to meet the expectations of your oshis.</p>



<p>…Of course, I wouldn’t say that part in front of her, though.</p>



<p>“Well, anyway, compared to Yuki, my worries are completely insignificant in scale and seriousness, and it’s really not something to worry about.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I said it as Yuki was persistent, but as I heard myself saying it, I couldn’t help but feel astonished at how small it really was. I felt truly sorry for making Yuki worry over something like this.</p>



<p>However,</p>



<p>“That’s not true!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki denied my thoughts with such force that I couldn’t help but fall silent, cut off mid-sentence by her overwhelming conviction.</p>



<p>“That’s not true! That’s a really serious concern! …Because, it means that your style of streaming might change in the future, right?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah, well, that might happen, I guess? Depending on the number of subscribers.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“That’s not okay!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>With tears welling up in her eyes, Yuki stared at me firmly and declared.</p>



<p>“That’s not okay! Changing your style means Kei-kun’s stream wouldn’t be Kei-kun’s stream anymore, right? Kei-kun, you’re precious just the way you are! There’s no need to change!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I mean…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Moreover, Kei-kun shouldn’t worry about such things! Kei-kun is always smiling happily, full of confidence, encouraging others and that’s enough…! So worrying about something like that, that’s not like my Kei-kun!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“What’s with this imaginary Kei-kun!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Facing Yuki’s sudden and extreme statement, I couldn’t help but genuinely retort.</p>



<p>…But really, can you blame me? What she’s saying is just too ridiculous!</p>



<p>Yet, despite my objections, Yuki kept insisting, repeating her point like a stubborn child. I couldn’t help but feel shocked in various ways, realizing that my oshi idol had such a troublesome side.</p>



<p>“Well, even if you say that, there are still people who wouldn’t think the same way…”  (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Those people don’t even like Kei-kun’s commentary to begin with!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Though I timidly attempted to argue back, Yuki firmly asserted her position.</p>



<p>“…I love Kei-kun’s commentary, I really do. Not just the commentary itself, but everything about it—the stories, the voice, just the whole style of the stream…! Kei-kun’s channel has given me so much of my strength. The words you said during the streams, they’ve really saved me from the bottom of my heart.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“…My words?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I had heard about how my commentary had supported Yuki before, but hearing that my words had saved her was news to me, so I instinctively asked for more details. In response, Yuki exclaimed, “I’ll show you the proof!” and started operating her PC, pulling up my archives.</p>



<p>“The words I’m talking about are from Kei-kun’s LoF live stream, around the forty-ninth minute and twelve seconds mark—” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“But seriously, remembering that level of detail is just too much!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Look, right here!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After locating the specific moment, Yuki clicked play. Suddenly, the lively tone of my voice filled the room.</p>



<p>“(—…So, that’s what I think. Doing what you love in your own way, that alone is something precious.)” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>…Oh, this is…!</p>



<p>I remembered. I vividly remember this moment. I definitely said those words. And it was something I truly believed.</p>



<p>The reason I came to feel that way was because of something that happened at that time.</p>



<p>“(So I’ll continue with game commentary as it is. After all, I love doing it. I’ll do what I like the way I like, so please continue to support me.)” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“This!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki stopped the playback there and pointed at the monitor with excitement.</p>



<p>“Did you hear that?! Those were Kei-kun’s words just now! They really encouraged me! ‘Do what you love in your own way’—I realized that singing is that for me, and it really helped me get back on my feet!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“No way…” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I muttered in astonishment at Yuki’s words.</p>



<p>…What the heck? Can something like this even happen? Is it a coincidence? Fate? Either way, it feels like a divine pank. Because—</p>



<p>“…Hey, earlier, we talked about what prompted us to become fans of each other, right? I don’t think I mentioned my trigger for becoming a fan of you yet.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, right! I haven’t heard it yet! I want to know!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“It’s simple. The catalyst was one song. The song was called ‘BELIEVE’, the first song Yuki ever wrote lyrics for.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As Yuki’s eyes widened in surprise, I continued.</p>



<p>“It was around the time when I had just started doing game commentary, but things weren’t going well. Despite my efforts, my views and subscriber count weren’t increasing at all. It was mentally tough, and I was starting to think about giving up. That’s when I came across ‘BELIEVE’ and listening to it… gave me the necessary strength.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I still vividly remember the emotions from that time. It was the first time I had ever experienced my body trembling from listening to music.</p>



<p>“That song, you know, it’s all about believing in hope for the future, right? Well, those lyrics really resonated with me at that time. They made me feel like I couldn’t give up like I had to keep doing commentary. That’s what sparked me to start supporting you, Yuki.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“….N-No way. That’s…!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>It felt like a lie, yet it was the truth. Even I couldn’t believe it.</p>



<p>“And the live stream right after listening to that song? Well, that’s the one you just played. My voice sounded unusually lively that day for that reason. Yuki said earlier that my words gave her courage, but those words were like what I received from you, Yuki.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>It’s really beyond just a twist of fate. It’s like a tangled web of connections. It’s kind of funny in a way.</p>



<p>I played that part once more. My voice sounded genuinely excited, and coupled with my attempts at sounding cool, I couldn’t help but feel like I was overdoing it a bit.</p>



<p>…But I really was alive back then, wasn’t I?</p>



<p>Remembering how I felt at that time, I felt a sudden warmth spreading through me, as if something had just settled comfortably in my stomach.</p>



<p>The anxiety that had been in my heart had disappeared without me realizing it. I felt strangely relieved, realizing that despite saying it wasn’t a big deal, I had actually been quite bothered by it. And to think that the answer to my worries was in my archive… It’s just ridiculous, I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>



<p>…It’s thanks to Yuki that I found this. Once again, she saved me. I guess I have no choice but to support her even more than before.</p>



<p>“But seriously, it’s amazing how you can remember such tiny details. Just how much do you support Kei?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I muttered to myself as I looked through the archive.</p>



<p>Even I, the one who uploaded it, don’t remember something like that.</p>



<p>“…Eh? Well, it’s only natural. After all, I remember everything. My feelings for supporting Kei-kun are just that strong.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki, who had been absent-minded until then, seemed to snap back to reality with those words. She puffed out her chest a bit proudly.</p>



<p>“I see, that’s quite an honor. But when it comes to supporting someone, my feelings to support Yuki are quite unbeatable.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but make such a competitive remark, having just decided to support her even more than before. Then, Yuki, showing an unusually determined expression, retorted,</p>



<p>“Sorry, but when it comes to being a ‘fan’, I won’t lose to anyone. No matter how much Kei-kun supports me, my feelings for supporting him are definitely stronger.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>She seemed to get a bit worked up for some reason as she countered like that.</p>



<p>…Hey, hey, if we’re going down this route, even if it’s Yuki, I can’t just stay quiet and accept your statement. I won’t stand for anyone underestimating my support for Yuki, you know?</p>



<p>“That’s something I can’t just let slide. Sorry, but I’d like you to reconsider the notion that I’m losing when it comes to supporting my oshi.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, so you’re challenging my Kei-kun passion, huh?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Sparks flew between Yuki and me as we exchanged banter.</p>



<p>While enjoying Yuki’s rare defiant expression, I had no intention of backing down.</p>



<p>“I remember every single detail of Kei’s streams and social media posts. Think you can match up to that?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“I check out every show and video you appear in, and of course, I’ve memorized all your songs.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Heh, that’s nothing compared to the amount of information I’ve gathered.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“And I’ve been buying up your merchandise like crazy. I’m pretty sure I’ve spent more money on you than any other high schooler out there!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Hey, that’s not fair! Every time I try to send you money, you refuse to accept it!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Well, I’m buying official merchandise, so it’s different. I’m not just handing over cash.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Ugh…! That’s still unfair! Kei-kun, you should release your own merchandise too!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Merchandise? I’m just a gaming YouTuber, you know!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“There are lots of possibilities. A photo book of Kei-kun, a Kei-kun plushie… Oh, I’m confident I’d buy an infinite amount if those existed! For storage, for display, for spreading the word, for bathing, for curry…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“What’s with the curry one!?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“It’s for eating curry! I’d have a dedicated one just in case curry stains it!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“That’s too specific!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“——Anyway, that’s how much I support Kei!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“——That’s why I support Yuki even more!” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>And so, we continued our noisy argument about who supports whom more.</p>



<p>For a while, the room was filled with bickering, but eventually, it all came to a sudden stop.</p>



<p>“…Haha, what are we even doing?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Hehe, you’re right.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Before long, we both started laughing without any particular reason.</p>



<p>“Haah… I never thought I’d exchange words like this with Kei-kun. Hehe…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After a good laugh, Yuki smiled happily and said so. I felt the same way. Having this kind of friendly argument with Yuki made me momentarily forget that she was my idol. That was a close one…</p>



<p>“Shall we head out soon?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>Since it was time, we decided to leave the internet cafe.</p>



<p>As we were about to part ways outside the shop, I was suddenly called out from behind. When I turned around, to my surprise, it was the man with the camera strap from earlier. I felt like I was going to shout out loud. Could he be from a weekly magazine!? Was he… waiting for us!?</p>



<p>“Excuse me, I’d like to ask you something. Do you happen to know if there used to be a small shrine around here?” (Man)</p>



<p>“Huh? A shrine?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>However, the man asked me with a friendly smile, not even glancing at Yuki.</p>



<p>“Yes, you see, I’m collecting local historical materials around this area.” (Man)</p>



<p>With that explanation, I could only respond with a bewildered apology, saying that I didn’t know.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kei-kun, what’s wrong? Was there something wrong with that man earlier?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>After the man left, Yuki asked me such a question while I was gazing at his retreating figure.</p>



<p>I explained that I had mistakenly thought the man was a reporter interested in Yuki, but Yuki responded with:</p>



<p>“People like that don’t dress so obviously.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>She said it with a chuckle after realizing that I was overthinking things.</p>



<p>“Yeah… you’re right. It was just a misunderstanding.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I laughed too. It was a laughter that felt like releasing pent-up tension from within.</p>



<p>…Yeah, it was just a misunderstanding. Everything was just my own assumptions.</p>



<p>Because my channel became popular, I thought I had to adjust my live commentaries accordingly, or I had to make better streams to meet the expectations of my fans, but all of that was just my assumption. As proof, no one actually told me to do any of those things.</p>



<p>In fact, it was quite the opposite. Yuki had said it herself. There’s no need to change.</p>



<p>Yeah, I just needed to be myself and continue doing what I love – game commentary.</p>



<p>“Hahaha” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Huh, what’s so funny? Did something happen?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki tilted her head in confusion as I burst into laughter out of the blue.</p>



<p>Truly, Yuki was an angel of sorts. She guided even the lost sheep, like me, without me even realizing it. And she was adorable doing it.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, this was the second time Yuki had come to my rescue. How could I ever repay my angelic friend, who had helped me in so many ways?</p>



<p>“I have a question. Can you tell me what time the local live starts from tomorrow?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Oh, sure… But why do you ask?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Well, you know… Oh, and one more question. Has the anxiety you had before your live concerts completely disappeared now?” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>“Um… Well, I still get a little nervous, I guess. But, when that happens, I watch your videos, so I’ll be fine! Your streams are my source of energy!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Yuki answers, squeezing her fist tightly.</p>



<p>While that response itself is very appreciated, what caught my attention was the first part.</p>



<p>“But seriously, why are you asking me that?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>As I was thinking about various things, Yuki asked me again.</p>



<p>…Well, isn’t it obvious?</p>



<p>“Because I’m a fan of yours, Yuki. I want to do what I can to help you.” (Keitaro)</p>



<p>I replied with just that, and then I engraved the live event start time she told me to my memory.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>So, the next day…</p>



<p>I started an impromptu livestream earlier than usual.</p>



<p>Because it was unscheduled, the viewer count was lower than usual. But since notifications go out to subscribers, quite a few people still tuned in.</p>



<p>While streaming the lobby screen of LoF, I said into the microphone.</p>



<p>“So, starting from now, I’m gonna do some solo ranked matches.” (Kei)</p>



<p>Immediately, comments started pouring in response to my words.</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [What’s up with this lol?]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Okay sure, but why lmao]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Solo sounds good!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Doing something funny out of the blue?]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Solo ranked now? Aren’t you in Grandmaster?]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [This is gonna be fun. I can’t wait lol.]</p>



<p>Oh, nice comments, everyone. That’s the kind of reaction I was hoping for.</p>



<p>“It’s all good, I’m doing it because it seems impossible at first glance. Anyway, I usually carry in solo queue, so I’ll appreciate your support.”</p>



<p>While casually responding to the comments, as promised, I queued up for solo ranked matches.</p>



<p>Regular ranked matches typically involve squads of three, but the game still counts you as part of a squad if you’re the only one inside. This is part of the official system.</p>



<p>Of course, the opponents are usually in a team of three, so it’s overwhelmingly disadvantageous for me. There are no bonuses to points either, so to put it plainly, there are only downsides. And my current rank is Grandmaster, the highest rank. In other words, it’s like willingly jumping into a zero-benefit ultra-super hard mode.</p>



<p>Now, why would I do such a thing? Well, it’s pretty obvious.</p>



<p>It’s just because I want to do it.</p>



<p>“Well then, here I go!” (Kei)</p>



<p>With a smile, I descend from the dropship.</p>



<p>The sense of constriction that has lingered ever since I got more popular seemed to have vanished as if it were a lie.</p>



<p>In this challenging endeavor, in commentating on it, and in the reactions from the comments section, there is nothing but pure enjoyment.</p>



<p>Gathering weapons in the initial landing spot, I managed to take down both teams that surrounded me.</p>



<p>Encountering another team in the next location, I ambushed them and managed to deal with them somehow.</p>



<p>The constant tense feeling of being in a pinch, the joy of expressing it in words, the bustling comments section—To love gaming, to love streaming, and moreover, to be able to support my oshi—you can’t get any better than this, can you?</p>



<p>As the match progressed, I faced numerous challenges but managed to survive until the end. Only two teams remained. In other words, there was only one enemy squad left.</p>



<p>Now, I have to face these formidable opponents head-on. The situation looks pretty bleak.</p>



<p>…But sorry, my dear enemies, this time I’m winning. It’s not about logic anymore. I’m completely fired up, and all I can see is victory!</p>



<p>I leap out from the shadows and throw myself into the final battle.</p>



<p>Grenades exploding, gunfire running, smoke billowing, and missiles raining down from the sky.</p>



<p>In the midst of this hellish battlefield, standing tall at the end is, of course, me.</p>



<p>“Yessssssssss!” (Kei)</p>



<p>The victory roar echoes, and the comment section scrolls like a storm in response.</p>



<p>While the stream erupted with excitement over my solo champion achievement in the Grandmaster tier, my mind wasn’t there. At that moment, there was only one thing on my mind.</p>



<p>─Was Yuki watching this stream?</p>



<p>☆</p>



<p>The nervousness before the live performance never seemed to fade away completely.</p>



<p>Because I love singing so much, I can feel the weight of each song gradually increasing.</p>



<p>Everyone tells me not to worry, and I know they’re right, but the anxiety still lingers. I suppose it’s just unavoidable.</p>



<p>Sitting alone in the dressing room, I hug my knees and let out a small sigh. But it’s okay. I have something precious that can make me forget this anxiety. Whenever I see it, courage always wells up inside me.</p>



<p>I take out my phone and try to watch Kei-kun’s archive as usual.</p>



<p>“Huh? W-Why is he streaming at this hour?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>However, after seeing the ongoing stream notification, I had to find out what was happening so I opened the stream. I was surprised to see that Kei-kun was doing a live stream. He’s never streamed at this time before… And as I watched, I was even more surprised to see that he was playing solo-ranked matches.</p>



<p>“(Yessssssssss!)” (Kei)</p>



<p>“Yessssss~!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Kei-kun’s victorious cry echoed through the screen, and our voices synchronized. Overwhelmed with joy, tears welled up in my eyes, and I found myself repeatedly calling out Kei-kun’s name.</p>



<p>“(Phew, managed to pull off a win… Ah, that last moment? Piece of cake. I had it under control. Well, almost died with ease. I don’t think I’ll be doing solo for a while. You guys talk about it so casually, but man, it’s exhausting as hell!)” (Kei)</p>



<p>After the victory, Kei-kun engaged in such banter with the comments. I wanted to chime in, but I couldn’t break our agreement not to chat in the regular comments. I briefly considered sending a message in our group chat, but right now, I just wanted to hear Kei-kun’s voice a little longer.</p>



<p>“(Huh? Why did I suddenly do solo ranked? Well…)” (Kei)</p>



<p>Amidst this, Kei-kun was attempting to answer a question from the comments.</p>



<p>“Well, there wasn’t any special reason, really. I just felt like it. That’s all.” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>Upon hearing those words, my heart raced with excitement. Kei-kun truly is amazing. He always finds a way to encourage me. I savored his words and resolved to face the upcoming live performance with determination.</p>



<p>However, Kei-kun’s response didn’t end there.</p>



<p>“(…Doing what you love with all your heart is a precious thing in itself. So, please… Take comfort in that and do your best…)” (Kei)</p>



<p>“Huh!?” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>At the continuation of his words, I couldn’t help but cry out.</p>



<p>It didn’t sound like a reply to the comments. It felt more like a direct message to someone─</p>



<p>“Oh…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>And then it hit me. It might be presumptuous. It might be my imagination. But I was certain I wasn’t mistaken.</p>



<p>This was a message meant for me.</p>



<p>“Kei-kun…! Sniff…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I felt so happy. I was overwhelmed with happiness, and tears welled up in my eyes.</p>



<p>Why does Kei-kun always manage to give me so much strength?</p>



<p>If he keeps doing things like this, I’ll just keep falling more and more in love with him. I’ll become even more dependent on Kei-kun… Kei-kun…! I love you…! I love you so much…!</p>



<p>As I shed tears of joy, Kei-kun was being teased in the comments, with questions like “Who were you talking to just now?” But he quickly changed the subject, saying, “It doesn’t matter who it was! Anyway–“</p>



<p>Even in that moment, Kei-kun’s actions were adorable. I couldn’t help but laugh through my tears.</p>



<p>“Hey Nozomi~ it’s almost time– …Wait, what’s wrong!?” (Karin)</p>



<p>At that moment, Karin-chan entered the dressing room and was startled to see me crying.</p>



<p>“W-What’s wrong!? Are you hurt or sick or something!?” (Karin)</p>



<p>“Oh, s-sorry, I’m okay…” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>I hastily wiped away my tears and stood up. Although Karin-chan was worried, I showed her a reassuring smile. There was no need to worry. Because right now, I felt like I was filled with energy from head to toe!</p>



<p>“Come on, Karin-chan, let’s go! Let’s make today the best stage ever!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“O-Okay, Nozomi, you’re quite fired up today…! That’s great and all, but you were crying a moment ago, so I’m seriously wondering if something happened. It doesn’t seem like it’s a bad thing though.” (Karin)</p>



<p>Seeing me full of energy, Karin-chan tilted her head in confusion.</p>



<p>Something happened? Yeah, something amazing did. </p>



<p>“I was cheered on by my oshi. That’s why I feel like nothing can stop me now right now. So, let’s go, Karin-chan!” (Nozomi)</p>



<p>“Huh? Uh, wait, Nozomi…” (Karin)</p>



<p>With the courage I received from Kei-kun hidden in my heart, I left the dressing room and headed towards the stage.</p>



<p>As I waited for the event to start, carrying the courage Kei-kun had given me, a certain thought crossed my mind.</p>



<p>It was about fate. The incident that became the catalyst for Kei-kun to support me.</p>



<p>Kei-kun had mentioned that he regained his confidence after listening to the first song I ever wrote, “BELIEVE”, but I couldn’t believe it when I heard that.</p>



<p>Because it was right after that song was released that I started feeling anxious about singing for the first time.</p>



<p>I began to wonder if things were okay as they were, and my anxiety kept growing…</p>



<p>It was at that time that I came across Kei-kun’s livestream, received courage, and found comfort…</p>



<p>But never did I imagine that behind the words that saved me, my song was also supporting Kei-kun. We were supporting each other without even realizing it…</p>



<p>Whether it’s fate or coincidence, I don’t know. I think it doesn’t really matter.</p>



<p>What’s important is that I feel even closer to Kei-kun now than ever before.</p>



<p>I gently close my eyes. Placing my hand on my chest, I feel as if Kei-kun is there. My heart flutters sweetly, and I’m enveloped in happiness.</p>



<p>It’s said that idols sing for everyone’s sake.</p>



<p>I’ve always believed that and sang my songs with that in mind.</p>



<p>But—</p>



<p>Just for today, please forgive me.</p>



<p id="imagetext"><a href="#image">For this one song, let me sing with my feelings poured out to the one who supports me.</a></p>



<p>Today’s first song — ”BELIEVE”.</p>



<p>▽</p>



<p>“I lost, huh? The opponent was strong.” (Kei)</p>



<p>I said with a completely deflated voice during the casual chat time at the end of that night’s regular livestream.</p>



<p>Honestly, everything—my mind, body, and even the stream itself—felt sluggish. The gameplay earlier was sluggish too, and I ended up dying and finishing second. Ah, I’m exhausted.</p>



<p>“Well, it can’t be helped. I guess I used up all my energy in that solo ranked match earlier.” (Kei)</p>



<p>I casually responded to comments like “Good effort”, “You died so hilariously at the end”, and “Well, it’s understandable you’re tired” with the same sluggishness.</p>



<p>Sorry, but I’m just not feeling it today. I’m not lying when I say I’m tired, but more than that, there’s something bothering me, and I can’t focus on the stream.</p>



<p>And of course, what’s bothering me is Yuki.</p>



<p>Did that message I sent earlier really reach her? Did I manage to encourage Yuki properly? That’s all I’ve been thinking about, and the result was me feeling like a noob who got sniped in the head and jumped off a cliff.</p>



<p>I check the time. It should be about the end of her live performance soon–or so I thought.</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Kei)</p>



<p>Suddenly, something unfamiliar pops up in the comments, catching me off guard for a moment.</p>



<p>But then I quickly realize it was a Superchat, which was I just enabled yesterday.</p>



<p>Oh, it seems someone threw their first Superchat. Thinking that, I check the name and the amount, and my body stiffens.</p>



<p><strong>Superchat (50,000 yen)</strong>: Wankoromochi──</p>



<p>W-What…!? Y-Yuki!? And… fifty thousand yen!? Wait, isn’t that the limit!?</p>



<p>There were no accompanying message in the Superchat. She must have followed my advice not to write too much in the comments section, but regardless, this amount is…!</p>



<p>As I’m still taken aback by the large sum, another Superchat is thrown. And this time, two almost simultaneously.</p>



<p>…Wait, isn’t this Serika’s alternate account!? And isn’t this one Sana’s!? And both are sending the maximum amount, what are they thinking!?</p>



<p>The comments section is buzzing with excitement over the back-to-back expensive Superchats, but I’m speechless at the sudden turn of events. Why would they suddenly…?</p>



<p>Anyway, I’m still in the middle of the stream. I’ll have to process this shock later. Amidst all the confusing developments, one thing is clear:</p>



<p>The message reached Yuki.</p>



<p>…Thank goodness. It seems I managed to be of help to Yuki in some way.</p>



<p>I exhale deeply and sink into my gaming chair.</p>



<p>Feeling both relieved and drained, my mind feels empty. Yet strangely, there’s also a refreshing sensation.</p>



<p>However, after a while, I start to feel strangely embarrassed about what I’ve done.</p>



<p>What will I do the next time I see Yuki at school? If she smiles at me like usual while I’m feeling like this, I’ll definitely reach my limit. To prevent that from happening, I need to calm down now.</p>



<p>I begin to seriously consider what I should say to Yuki when we meet.</p>



<p>But before that, I remember something important that I need to address.</p>



<p>That is—</p>



<p>“…Even if you’re supporting me, could you please go a little easier on me?” (Kei)</p>



<p>Muttering such thoughts, I seriously ponder whether I should just turn off the Superchat after all.</p>

<p><em>For this one song, let me sing with my feelings poured out to the one who supports me.</em></p>
