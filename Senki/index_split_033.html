<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_35">Chapter 74: Nuisance Money</h1>

	<p class="block_2">I walk to the merchant guild to finish up my business there. Today I’m here alone.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m taken to the same room as before, where Arthur and Coutre are waiting.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What is your decision?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I ask, and I’m handed a high quality cloth with a coin inside. It gives off a white shine, so is this a platinum coin? I’ve never seen one before, so I’m not sure.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“This is a platinum coin. Please take it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Arthur as he hands me the cloth and the coin with a troubled expression on his face.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Use it to rebuild that village. It’s the merchant guild’s responsibility, so I don’t know if you need to talk to the villagers over there or the feudal lord, but just inform them and use that money well.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Is that all?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, as long as you use it properly. Of course, I might come by to ask how the money is being used, so make sure to keep records. To put it bluntly, I don’t really trust the guild employees either.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I warn them. There might be people who will think of getting rid of middlemen and pocketing the money.</p>

	<p class="block_2">That reminds me of those two gold coins I received when I first came to this world. I can’t say for sure that they took some of the money, but I can’t say they didn’t either.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Very well. We will see that it is done.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. And you can announce that this money is being offered by the Aurora company as aid to help rebuild the village. I mean, you did pay for it, and the process was pretty painless.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I thought they would try to beat down the price, but they paid for it in full.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Trying to push them in this situation might actually turn out to be dangerous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Understood. I will report that to the main office.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Good. That ends my business here.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I get up and leave the merchant guild, even as the two men look like they want to say something.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Next, I head to the adventurer guild, where Leila is waiting.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Did you wait long?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Don’t worry. How did it go in the merchant guild?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Exactly as we talked about yesterday.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. I was surprised when I first heard you mention reparations, but I’m relieved to see it was not out of greed.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“If it was just for me there’s no way I’d ask for a platinum coin.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But you still need to earn money, right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">She’s right. I really didn’t expect to have to pay five hundred gold coins.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I looked into the market prices, and figured I could buy her for fifty to a hundred gold coins. Even the first slaves that they showed me there cost at most fifty gold coins.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But I don’t think you need to spend so much, if all you want is a guard. Are you picky about a particular trait or something?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m not picky, it’s just that the girl I have to buy costs five hundred gold coins.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I want to check the quests for now. And I want to check where medicinal herbs grow if I can.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">We enter the adventurer guild together, and it’s relatively empty since it’s past noon.</p>

	<p class="block_2">In any adventurer guild, it’s hard to get the good quests if you’re not here in the morning.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I check the quests, and for some reason I see a lot related to security. I guess all sorts of trouble can happen when so many people gather for the advent festival.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“There aren’t that many hunting quests. Ah, but there are a few picking quests.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says Leila.</p>

	<p class="block_2">They pay the normal price. I can earn more money picking medicinal herbs and using them to make potions.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Even if I work hard completing these picking quests, I’ll only get a few gold coins.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Sorry, but can you just ask them where I can pick herbs?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“You got it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Leila walks to the reception desk, and I stay here looking at the available quests.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Most of the hunting quests are about hunting goblins and wolves. There’s one aimed at higher ranked adventurers about hunting a tigerwolf. It says it was sighted on the main road to the republic…</p>

	<p class="block_2">Then there’s one about hunting killer bees, and collecting honey. Honey is used for various things here.</p>

	<p class="block_2">As for get-rich-quick quests… Dragon hunt? Now that’s fantasy. There wasn’t a dragon attack or anything, it’s just someone after materials. It pays a platinum coin per dragon, and it was put up by the alchemist guild.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What are you looking at?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Asks Leila as she peeks over my shoulder. Too close, your face is too close.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“This quest about hunting dragons.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Ah… This. These quests are pasted in every large adventurer guild. But if someone actually takes down a dragon, they’re going to put it up for auction.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Really?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes. This level of reward might be profitable if the dragon that’s being hunted is a mini or a subspecies.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I see. Have you ever seen a dragon?”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“I haven’t, but there are records of dragons being sighted in the lower levels of the dungeon. Although I don’t know if that is true.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">So there are dragons in the dungeon. Is there something like a dragon floor or something?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Anyway, I asked about medicinal herbs. That could be a problem here, so let us go back to Yor’s home first.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yes, I guess asking for an outsider could be bad for her.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I follow Leila out of the adventurer guild.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“What are you going to do in the time until the advent festival?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“For now, my plans are to pick medicinal herbs. Also, can you train with me too?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Train?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Yes, I want to get better at fighting with a sword. You’re good at that, right?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Not good enough to be a good teacher, but I suppose we could do some mock battles. It would be better if you fought not just me, but the others too. Fighting someone else is bound to be a good experience for us as well.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Then let’s do it when you have the time. You have homework to do, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_2">“I sure do. And I can’t help but lament how better off I would be if I didn’t.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Apparently the academy assigns homework on long breaks. Being a student sure is tough. Yes, it sure was.</p>
