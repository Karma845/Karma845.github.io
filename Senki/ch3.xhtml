<h1>Chapter 3: A Conversation With The Princess</h1>

<div class="text-left">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um…Your Highness?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staring at her beautiful face at close range, I spoke in a quiet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our foreheads were close enough to touch if either of us relaxed, so I took care not to surprise her by talking too loudly. I didn’t want her to feel intimidated. One must be a gentleman when in the presence of a lady. It was something my late grandfather taught me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the lady in front of me looked upset, with her hands shaking and face red. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cute.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that… that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, please calm down. I’m not going to hurt you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure if this was the best way to calm her down, but I didn’t know any better. The women in my department were all violent… um, reliable. I rarely ever met a girl like her that stirred up my protective instincts. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I could see her as a younger sister, but I’m not too sure about that anymore.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still had yet to regain her composure. The flustered girl with crimson cheeks was too adorable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cuteness aside, I should probably do something about this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrapped my hands around hers and pulled her face a little closer, shortening the distance that was too short already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s take a deep breath, okay? Look, inhale… exhale.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked confused, but she breathed according to my rhythm. The redness in her cheeks subsided and the pace of her respiration returned to normal. With this, we could finally have a conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I showed you something unsightly…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no. You were endearing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, endearing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She blushed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had only just regained her composure, but if I wasn’t careful we’d be back to square one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cleared my throat and looked at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, why are you here? The private rooms in the palace are warmer and far more comfortable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I wanted to get some air outside… and then, you know… I saw you here, Raize-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? You know my name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Doesn’t everyone in the royal palace know? The youngest genius to become a court magician.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the princess talk excitedly, my mouth slackened. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t believe the royal family knows who I am… I’m kind of embarrassed. How did this happen?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think I’m a genius… I’ve just known magic for a long time. Becoming a court magician was out of luck. I’m just an ordinary person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve heard that no one compares to you in magic?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way. There are probably thousands of people in this world who are better than I am.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you’re good enough to work here, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if I weren’t good enough, I wouldn’t be here right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I spoke, I noticed that the princess had lost all of her earlier tension. She could chat normally now. Her face was bright and directed towards mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyways, Her Highness was wearing fairly light clothes. In this kind of weather, she only had a light blue nightgown and an unbuttoned coat. She could easily catch a cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it cold, Your Highness? The temperature is especially low tonight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, isn’t it fine? To tell you the truth, this nightgown has a charm that reduces the cold even with such thin fabric─”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Highness stiffened, as if she had noticed something. Then, she blushed and quickly pulled her coat closed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This princess blushes so often.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, I’m… in front of the lord in such light clothes…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Face down and mumbling, she seemed embarrassed about wearing her nightgown in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, seeing the princess in her nightgown was surely a rarity, but I really didn’t care that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I usually sleep with my shirt on. To be honest, any sleepwear will do for me. I could probably even sleep naked. Not that I actually do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike me, who doesn’t really care about fashion, the princess—actually, it seems like all women care a lot about what they wear when they go to bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay. You look good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s the problem… ha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her embarrassed look was too adorable. Her beauty was a topic of conversation in the royal palace, but seeing her up close was a whole different experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the smell of her hair made my heart flutter whenever she was around. Probably because I had low immunity towards women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced up and noticed that the moon was reaching the apex of its path across the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, please return to your room. Staying up late is bad for your beauty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s already this late.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we stood up, the princess and I walked to the door leading into the palace. We were headed to different places: me to my office, and Her Highness to the palace’s main building. I had work tomorrow, so I couldn’t afford to lose too much sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Your Highness. I will excuse myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, um…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scratching her cheek, the princess looked away from me and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s talk again, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned and made my way to my office, now with a cheerful smile and a spring in my step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This evening, I was able to talk to the princess for the first time.</span></p>
