	<p class="block_2">Cardinal Dan takes me back to the church, and that puts an end to the time that felt like a dream.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The moment I step inside the church, I feel something is off. People bow as I pass by them on my way to my room, like they always do, but I feel resentment, something that feels like enmity in their eyes.</p>

	<p class="block_2">They might be upset at me for abandoning my duties.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I change into my proper clothes, and Regulus comes by to see me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I apologize for being selfish, but he says he forgives me with a kind smile on his face.</p>

	<p class="block_2">After the morning prayer, we confirm the procedure of the advent festival.</p>

	<p class="block_2">First, all the cardinals greet the head of the church, then I kneel before him, accept his words, bow, and go back to my original position.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The first year, I was so nervous that I fell and embarrassed myself in front of everyone, so I’ve been working hard to make sure I don’t make another mistake like that. I’m sure I’ll be fine this year.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Just as I’m thinking that it’s probably almost time to have lunch, Cardinal Dan shows up with a grave look on his face. It looks like he wants to say something, but in the end, someone comes and takes him away as we talk about what happened the last few days.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Then I have lunch, say my noon prayer, and I’m called to the reception hall by the head of the church.</p>

	<p class="block_2">When I get there I see not only the head of the church, but cardinals too, and high priests that are heading to various churches. Seeing these people all standing in the same room really gives me the feeling that the advent festival is starting.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m taken by guards to the center of the room and told to stay here. Feeling everyone’s eyes on me makes me nervous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Everyone is here. Today, a message from our goddess was bestowed upon me.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Says the head of the church, and I listen intently.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It said a disaster will fall upon this land.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hear some people gasping.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“And I just received a message from the adventurer guild. They have found signs of an incoming stampede.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Some people look surprised, some try to look calm, and some quietly nod. We have all kinds of reactions here. None of the cardinals react, probably because they already knew.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“But there is more. A divine message revealed that this stampede is not without cause.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">All eyes focus on the head of the church. I’m also waiting for him to continue.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“The saint standing before us, Mia, is a false saint. The disaster falling upon this land is punishment for attempting to deceive our goddess.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">…What?</p>

	<p class="block_2">The shock takes my breath away. I can’t even process what I hear.</p>

	<p class="block_2">And the eyes of the cardinals around me slowly turn to me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“It is unfortunate, I was also fooled by how devoted you seemed.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I feel a sudden pain.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I stumble and take a step back, and feel an impact on my left flank that feels like it burns.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look down, and see red staining my mainly white clothes.</p>

	<p class="block_2">My first reflex is to cast heal, but I can’t move very well.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I fall to my knees, look up, and then face back.</p>

	<p class="block_2">My eyes meet the eyes of a guard, who is holding a dagger.</p>

	<p class="block_2">His eyes are painted with hatred.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m scared. My mind is saying I have to get away, but my body won’t listen.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Someone help. I want to call for help, but my voice won’t come out. Instead, tears start streaming down my face.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I hear someone scream, and noise jumps into my ears.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t understand what is being said. My consciousness feels hazy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">My eyes feel like they’re being drawn to the floor, and then it feels like my body is floating.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look back at everyone, and see they all look surprised.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Their faces are gradually moving away. No, I’m the one that’s moving.</p>

	<p class="block_2">One of the cardinals steps forward. He’s the shortest, and youngest cardinal. The youngest person to ever take that position, and someone who is called a prodigy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">He nods, and puts out his hand.</p>

	<p class="block_2">My eyes are drawn to that hand. I feel magic energy gathering in it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Oh no. It’s dangerous. This is bad. I feel like alarm bells are going off.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Magic energy is coming. The distance doesn’t matter, it will be here in an instant.</p>

	<p class="block_2">But it looks really slow to me.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s like death is approaching one step at a time.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Yes, this is the end.</p>

	<p class="block_2">No no no! I don’t want to die!</p>

	<p class="block_2">I yell, but no noise actually comes out.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I want to live. Dying in such a stupid way is too sad.</p>
	<p class="block_2">This is too much. Even if it’s punishment for being selfish.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I just made friends. I made such fun memories, and I want to make a lot more.</p>

	<p class="block_2">There was finally color on that gray scenery.</p>

	<p class="block_2">And I even found someone I’m interested in.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t really understand these feelings, but I can tell they’re really important.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Magic energy explodes with a loud noise. It feels like the whole building is shaking.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m being assaulted by an extreme languid feeling, and my consciousness feels hazy, but I’m alive. I don’t know why, but I’m alive.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m held by a guard, and the way I’m shaking is strangely relaxing, which prompts me to let go of my consciousness completely.</p>
