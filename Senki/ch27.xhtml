<h2 class="c6">Chapter 27: Extreme-Level Magic</h2>

<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“The distance is……10 kiras, I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The bulwark surrounding the royal capital──</span><span>I
 went to the south side of that and let out a disheartened sound when 
strengthened vision magic was unnecessary to see the figure of the big 
monster.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>It had two huge wolf heads and 
seven snakes for tails. The length was……about 20 meras, I think? 
Probably about the same as the royal palace’s main building. If ordinary
 magicians were its opponents, they would not be able to defeat it.</span><span> Rather than being ferociously dangerous like the chimera from a few days ago, it was strong.</span><span class="c1"> </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Then……I, by myself……</span><span>probably slowly and earnestly complained that enough was enough. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No, I wasn’t the only person here.  </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From the view from the top of the bulwark, a human figure froze and gave me a fleeting horizontal glance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Are, are you okay? Reize-sama……”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Defeating it is easy. Your Highness.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I replied to the uneasy person I saw, Her Royal Highness the princess──Rishena-sama.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>I would say how this came to be was simple. </span><span>Before
 coming here, Milena-san said to Rishena-sama who was embracing me, 
“Oujo-sama, you are probably anxious today too. It’s fine, because 
Reize-kun will escort you to the royal palace</span><span>,” and told me
 to take her with me. Cruel. Really cruel. Even though there was no 
danger, a young woman seeing that fiendish magical beast……Huh? 
Arina-san? That young woman isn’t a monster……if she knew, she’d kill me.
 </span><span class="c3">(TL: Oujo = princess, ojou = young lady)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Si,
 simple you say……The opponent is a magical beast that is designated as a
 dangerous species, isn’t it? Even whether 10 first-class magicians 
could win is hard to say……”</span></p><p class="c2"><span>“I’m well aware. However, don’t worry. Those are </span><span>typical</span><span class="c1"> first-class
 magicians──in other words, a case where they can use advanced level 
magic. No magician has our Annihilation Force’s magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I unsheathed my rapier, wore magic and stabbed at my feet. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Before, Your Highness told me about the magic you possessed──Mind's Eye.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Uh, ye, yes.” </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“I can’t call this a return favor, but I’ll also show you.  My strongest magic──Unlocking.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A
 magic equation was formed starting from the place the rapier was 
stabbed in──Light particles converged in front of me, and a golden bow 
appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“A bow……Do, don’t tell me, you’re sniping from this distance?!”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“? Yes, but…”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“That, that’s impossible! How could a magician reach from this range──”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her
 Highness looked as if she had seen something unbelievable, but I was 
serious about doing it. Or rather, always sniping from the royal palace 
was harder because the target was smaller, wasn’t it?  </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Moreover, in comparison, Ortus might be far away, but the target was large and moving slowly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“It’s fine. I’ll defeat it without fail.”</span></p><p class="c2"><span>“……You’re using that bow, right? But judging from appearances, it looks equivalent to a sharp sword.”</span></p><p class="c2"><span>“As you can see. The name is Star King Bow.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Gold bow──Holding Star King Bow in my hand, I pushed my other hand out and closed my eyes. </span><span> At
 the same time, I charged the Star King Bow with magic power. Thereupon,
 from the magic circle at my feet, eight arrows appeared. </span><span>At</span><span class="c1"> fixed intervals, they revolved around me. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“──Lightning.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After
 speaking, one of the eight arrows-the one clad in blue 
lightning-settled in my hands, and the other arrows vanished into the 
magic circle. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I nocked the 
arrow clad in surging lightning onto the Star King Bow and determined 
where to take aim at. The target was obviously──that Ortus. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>If
 Milena-san’s intelligence was correct, the magic equation I gathered 
earlier was highly likely to be the same kind as the magic stone the 
magical beast possessed.</span><span>  </span><span>That, too, I saw.</span><span class="c1"> Ortus was similar to the chimera in that they were both magical beasts that did not live in the vicinity. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Leaving the danger alone was out of the question. This was the worst; it was probably attacking the royal capital. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In
 proportion to pulling the bowstring strongly, blue lightning torrented 
into the surroundings and a high-pitched noise could be heard in the 
air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>“───” </span><span class="c3">(TL: Imagine a high-pitched sound)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rishena-sama
 said something, but I really could not hear. I took my attention away 
from that, pointed the tip of the arrow towards the target, kept a 
pointed line of sight, and took a deep breath──.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Pierce, lightning star──”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I fired the lightning arrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">◇ </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">*(Richena’s POV)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Ah──”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>When I saw Reize-sama’s blue lightning, my heart was pounding, and I felt like it made a giant leap.  </span><span>I was so unconsciously fascinated that I forgot to breathe.  </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It
 flashed by in my mind, that time──when a magical beast in the forest 
attacked and I fell into desperate situation with no escape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When
 everyone was preparing to die, suddenly lightning came flying in. A 
beautiful magic easily and one-sidedly defeated the magical beast that 
had driven the group of skilled knight-sama into a corner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was a different magic compared to that time. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But that lightning’s beauty──My fascination was the same as then──……</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“──Divine Arrow”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reize-sama muttered calmly and solemnly, and the arrow was fired with fierce thunder and gales.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>The overgrown trees at the spot it passed through were mowed down as it scattered a power that could be called a calamity.──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">◇</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">*(Reize POV)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Mission……accomplished, I hope.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I
 somehow stood with both legs despite being attacked by a terrible 
despondence. The Star King Bow in my hand turned to particles and 
vanished, And the magic circle made from the rapier’s tip also 
disappeared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>My fired Lightning Star Divine Arrow moved towards Ortus’ central part and shot out with unmatched accuracy.</span><span class="c1"> </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The
 piercing arrow furthermore created a lightning fissure with the impact 
on the ground behind it, shot lightning from the ground to the sky, and 
disappeared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Ah, shoot.” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly the strength in my legs faded and I couldn’t stand. I fell backwards where I was──into a soft feeling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Are you okay, Reize-sama?”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Th, thank you very much. Haha, I, overused my magical powers a little bit.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just
 above was Rishena-sama looking into me. As it was, I switched my 
position to a lap pillow. I didn’t have the strength to astand up, so 
I’d just talk as the way things were now. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“The magic just now was──”</span></p><p class="c2"><span>“That
 was my special magic. Officially, all attribute super long-range, 
extreme level magic──Eight Star Arrows. Using arrows with all attributes
 aside from no attribute to annihilate the enemy──My possessed magic. </span><span>Using wind and lightning with arrows makes it a bit special. </span><span class="c1">」</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It’s because my usable magic is extremely unbalanced that I have this magic. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since
 my possessed magic is too specialized for long distance and super long 
distances, only beginner level magic could be used for short and medium 
distance was beginner level magic. On the contrary, thanks to having 
this magic, I was able to master using it at long distance and beyond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Such powerful magic……”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“It
 is strong, but it also has many weaknesses. Once I use it, I’ll be 
attacked by despondency and exhaustion and fall into a state of magical 
deficiency.  Firing continuously……is not impossible if the magic 
power was restored, but it’s better to stop it. Essentially, it’s 
limited to a one shot powerful technique──Rishena-sama?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Rishena-sama gently stroked my head and had an affectionate look. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>“Honestly,
 you’re such an amazing person. Mastering that kind of magic, not 
swaying in the short-distance battle you’re not good at, beating that 
Arsenas……”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“………”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What was this feeling? </span></p><p class="c2"><span>It
 was embarrassing to be stroked on the head while in a lap pillow, but 
it was very calming. Arina-san tightened──hugged me closely sometimes, 
but that was completely different. I was honestly glad I protected her 
who had hardships. </span><span class="c5">(TL: “Her” references the princess)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“By the way, Reize-sama. I have something I’m a little worried about.” </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Hm? What’s that?” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I opened my closed eyes, I saw a hand on the bottom of my neck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“The magical equation on the bottom of your neck I saw earlier……I don’t see that anymore……”</span></p><p class="c2"><span>“───</span><span class="c8">Huh.</span><span class="c1">” </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her
 hand created thin ice on her palm and reflected my neck using it as a 
mirror. There was beautiful white skin with nothing drawn on it. The 
degree of flesh was poor and the clavicle had risen to the surface. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Certainly
 Her Highness──I had a mysterious feeling that the name of Rishena came 
to mind……but the oath (geas) itself was canceled?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“What……oh”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“?”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was one thing I could think of. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>That’s it. Certainly at that time, I felt a burning sensation in my head and bottom of my neck……</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“May I ask you one thing?” </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Yes. What is it?”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“When Arsenas was about to send my head flying, Rishena-sama muttered something right? What were you muttering?”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“?……muttering”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saying
 that, Rishena-sama for some reason blushed and turned her face away 
from me.   Then she put both hands on my eyes and covered my 
vision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Ri, Rishena-sama?” </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“He, hearing that mutter is forbidden! I order you as a princess!”</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"> “I, I understand……”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If
 I was ordered by the princess, I wouldn’t go against it, so I nodded 
obediently. But I’m really curious about what she said. I wondered if it
 met the conditions for cancelling the oath, but I couldn’t confirm it. 
Well, let’s just consider the cancellation a good thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this way, I was able to call her name safely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">◇</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took deep breaths in the night breeze to cool my hot cheeks. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At
 that time, I really thought Reize-sama was going to disappear, so I 
muttered as if to squeeze out the voice of my heart. But it’s very 
embarrassing when I think about it now……</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In front of him in my lap who had a look of relief……I couldn’t. It was like a confession. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Because──</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">“(Don’t kill my Reize-sama……)”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I couldn’t say that……</span></p>
