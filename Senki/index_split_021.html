<h1 class="block_" id="toc_id_23">Chapter 62: Magic Energy Course – Part two</h1>

	<p class="block_2">“W-what? What?”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Isn’t it self-explanatory?</p>

	<p class="block_2">“This happened because I infused the mithril sword with magic energy. It’s like it became tougher and sharper.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I’m doing my best to explain, but I think everyone is too excited to listen.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Master, incredible.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Only Hikari praises me. She looks a bit proud too.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I pat Hikari’s head and wait for the excitement to die down. I hope they settle down soon, because at this rate Hikari might melt before they do.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Eventually I realize that’s just not happening, so I force them back to reality.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“I think you understand, but this power was infused into it by making magic energy flow. But there are a few things to keep in mind.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Listen to me. This won’t be on the test, but it could save your life.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“First, the conductivity of magic energy… It’s not as easy to do this with something that doesn’t have good conductivity. It’s not like you can’t do it, but it needs more magic energy. The mithril sword for example has good conductivity.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">Everyone listens with serious expressions.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Second, and this is important, when you’re making magic energy flow, you will pass out if you go over your limit. I think Leila saw it, but you become completely defenseless. As you start to run out, you become languid, so I think you’ll know when it’s coming.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“That’s magic energy intoxication, isn’t it? When you use too much magic, your consciousness becomes muddy. At least that’s what magic users call it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Magic energy intoxication… That’s probably it.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I guess that’s what it’s like. Although I’ve never drank alcohol, so I can’t say I’ve ever been intoxicated.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The three who use mithril swords are even more attentive than the others. Leila actually saw that sharp edge when we fought the orclord, so she knows how useful it is.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Maybe it will be easier for you to feel magic energy and understand this if you practice infusing mithril swords and daggers with magic energy.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">I don’t think they’re going to be able to just feel it, but they can probably tell if something is infused with magic energy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I wish there was anything they could use to practice. I should check to see if I can make something with alchemy.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I tell them to ask for help if there’s anything else they don’t understand, and leave the room.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The feminine smell in that room was making my head spin. Ahh, it was hard not to lose my senses. To be more precise, I was strangely nervous because I’m not used to it.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I move to the watchtower at the top of the inn, and check the status of the village.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It’s rundown to the point where it’s easy to spot the few buildings that retain their original shape. It reminds me of footage I would see on TV after a hurricane.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The village lost some of its population too. What will happen to it?</p>

	<p class="block_2">I bring out Map, and use Presence Detection.</p>

	<p class="block_2">The orcs reached the cave two days ago, but haven’t moved from there.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I look towards the road, and see a group moving on the edge of the map. If everything goes smoothly, they should be here in four days. Will the orcs get moving again first, or will the wagons get here before that? If the orcs decide to come after the village, they can reach it in one day. Above all else, we need to be cautious.</p>

	<p class="block_2">“Status open.”</p>

	<p class="block_2">(Cooking Lv7)</p>

	<p class="block_2">NEW</p>

	<p class="block_2">(Pain Reduction Lv1) (Dark Magic Lv1)</p>

	<p class="block_2">Pain Reduction softens the pain I feel. The pain I felt from the orclord’s blows almost broke my concentration, so I got this as a countermeasure. But the problem with this skill is that I don’t know how much it will reduce pain as it levels up. I shudder to think that I could sustain near fatal damage and not even realize it because of Pain Reduction. I need to be careful about this.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Dark Magic is what the name implies. I got it because I wanted to have all the attributes… And I don’t regret it. Apparently it’s more fit for support than attack.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I already have more skills than magic. Should I start calling myself a sorcerer? No, my magic is still too low leveled. I’d be a sorcerer that focuses more on physical attacks when he fights.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I should try using alchemy to make the magic item I have in mind.</p>

	<p class="block_2">It feels like cheating that I just picture what I want to make and it pops into my mind, but if I don’t picture it well, it ends up as a completely different thing, so it’s kind of dull.</p>

	<p class="block_2">I want to be able to capture magic energy visibly. I can follow its flow with Magic Energy Detection, but others can’t. I explained it with words and drawings, but I don’t think I really got that idea across. If we infuse mithril with magic energy, the only way to check how it turned out is by checking its sharpness, and that can get dangerous.</p>

	<p class="block_2">Hn? Will this do? Once a magic stone loses its magic energy, it loses its color and becomes transparent. If we infuse it with magic energy, it once again gains some sort of color. I see the color varies depending on the person’s preferred element. I need magic stones, so could I take them from the orcs?</p>
	<p class="block_2">But I should talk to Leila about taking their magic stones. We hunted them together, so I can’t just use them as I please.</p>
