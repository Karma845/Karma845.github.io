<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 7: Fugitive in the Blue Night, Hope is Fleetingly Plucked Away</h2>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sun, driven beyond
the horizon, cast its last glow over the world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Under a sky filled
with blazing colors, a ghastly scene was unfolding.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first girls' dormitory
had already collapsed, crushed from the inside by the raging waves reflecting
the various lights that pervaded the world. The crystals kept multiplying and
expanding their scope of destruction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She gazed at the scene
of tremendous destruction with a calm thought.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not out of
hatred that she had dragged the school into hell. It was simply because she
thought it was the best way to expose the rats that were causing harm to the
school.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If their goal was to
identify the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, there would be no more obvious bait.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, if the rats
chose to leave things as they were, they would eventually be killed, so it was
inevitable that they would come to stop the destruction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since she used revenge
as a pretext, her connection to the headmaster will not be noticed by the other
students. The girls' dormitory would be restored overnight by a psychic on the
instructor's side, and all but the students showing defiance to the school
would be unharmed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Please
watch over me, Headmaster. I will make sure that all threats will be nipped in
the bud."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A prayer-like voice
melted into the beautiful scene.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had decided only
to report the situation to the headmaster after she had cut off the rats'
heads.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This way, she could
avoid bothering the busy headmaster, and more importantly, she would be able to
demonstrate her usefulness to him in a more effective way.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After that, she might
finally be able to see him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nina arrived at
the remains of the first girls' dormitory, Karen Ashby was sitting on top of a
mountain of glowing, red-colored crystals, looking up into the sky.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystals were
still proliferating in a destructive fashion, but there was little movement
within a radius of about 10 meters centered on Karen. Perhaps to prevent
herself from being crushed to death, she had partially slowed down the rate of
their proliferation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Stingray, I
didn't expect you to show your face."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still sitting on the
crystals, Karen turned only her eyes toward Nina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I mean, how did
you even manage to get here? I'm pretty sure it's not easy to get near
here."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina braced herself
once again.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The truth was that
Emma, whose physical abilities had been enhanced by candy doping, had carried
her, but of course, she had no intention of telling that fact.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't know
whether it was because you were so scared of me or not, but your crystals were
moving neatly avoiding me. It's a strange phenomenon, no?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Psychokinesis-based
barrier, huh? Well, that much is to be expected."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way,
Karen-san, have you gotten permission from the school? You seem to be rampaging
around as you please......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no need
for that."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You said it with
so much confidence, huh."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because I have a
good reason. I have a cause. I have to make sure that the villains who hurt my
best friend get what they deserve."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's just an excuse,
Nina spat inwardly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya's case was
staged. Even if Satya were safe, she would have pretended that she suffered an
attack and was hiding somewhere. This would be the best solution to get rid of
the Republic's spy without anyone suspecting her involvement with the school
principal.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">In the first
place, why does the school show no reaction to this situation?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Is it a
decision in favor of those who were exempted from the entrance exams?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Are they
taking the situation lightly because there are no casualties yet?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Or is it
because the person who caused the rampage is from the school side?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It is obvious which of these is the correct answer.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I'm not
interested in your reasons."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I am curious.
Why did you attack Satya?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're being
awfully paranoid, aren't you?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then why did you
show up here?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Nothing
in particular. I'm just here to get rid of an eyesore."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina put on a
heartless, monster-like smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You know what I
hate most, Karen-san? I hate it most when people act like spoiled children and
mistakenly believe that they can do whatever they want as long as they act out
of control. Because they are just too ignorant. Don't you find it extremely
arrogant to think that you are the center of the world?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So what are you
trying to say?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"You have a bad
intuition, huh? Didn't you get it? I just can't tolerate the idea that a being
far inferior to myself is getting carried away here at Heiberg School. When a
filthy vermin walks brazenly across your room, it makes you want to kill it,
doesn't it?</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's the same
feeling."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen laughed heartily
when she heard this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If only this moment
were captured, it would seem as if the world was not teeming with hell. Karen
laughed with such a pure expression on her face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I knew it,
you're interesting. By the way, ......" Karen stood up abruptly. "If
you're going to fight me, we're inevitably going to have to kill each
other."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A sharp murderous
intent erupted from Karen's entire body.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The backlight blocked
Nina's vision, making it impossible to see her facial expression. Even so, Nina
could tell that she was looking at her with a cruel gaze.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Good, I caught her.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Everything up
to this point has gone according to plan.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Now that she's
been provoked like this, she'll definitely give in to my demands.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I wish we could
kill each other right here and now, but ...... Karen-san, sadly, this school is
not a lawless zone. There is an order called extraterritoriality. Even if we
were going to kill each other, we might as well fill out a pledge form."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A &lt;Duel&gt;,
eh? Fine, what are the rules?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A simple battle
will do. The victory condition is that either one of us must be incapacitated
or surrender. Ah, I prepared an escape route called "surrender" as a
mercy to you.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, the loser
should be penalized by losing all the points he/she possesses and being
expelled from the school. That is, if you still retain your life after losing.
And as for the venue, I think the old school building that my class used for
the &lt;Practical Examination&gt; would be perfect. There will be no one around
there, and it will be much more convenient for you to fight indoors,
right?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Okay, that's
fine. Just hurry up and fill out the pledge form-......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't be in such
a hurry. We will also set some detailed rules just to be safe.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, the game starts
with both parties hiding in any room in the old school building. The signal to
begin will be given by that tin doll, Jake, who will be our witness."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why such a
roundabout way?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's a reference
to the rules of the last &lt;Hide and Seek&gt; test we had. Well, it's just for
fun. It doesn't really matter to you and me, anyway."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fine, I guess.
What about the rest of the rules?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Secondly, the
battle area should only be inside the old school building. If you are more than
five meters away from there, you will be defeated unconditionally. Of course,
this is a rule that prohibits us from escaping.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the third. Let's
also add that harming anyone other than those involved in the duel will also
result in defeat. Considering your psychic abilities and mine, I thought it
would be necessary to take this into consideration as well."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I can see you're
trying to lay a trap here. Can you add a sentence that says, [The third rule
does not apply to those who enter the battleground or engage in a &lt;duel&gt;
by any means from outside the battleground]?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Got it.
Let's add that."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina took a pledge
form from the pocket of her uniform and added the conditions Karen had
mentioned.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If Karen were to miss
this rule, she could have used a trick to force a foul win by having Jin sneak
into the old school building and intentionally injure himself, but Karen was
surprisingly cautious.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She must have
anticipated the possibility of Nina fighting together with Jin. The reason why
Karen did not propose the rule of [prohibiting outsiders from entering the
battleground] might be because she wanted to get rid of all the obstacles at
once.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Based on this calm
thinking, she has a psychic ability that is so powerful that she can use
[berserk] and [madness as a card to hunt down her enemies. As was the case with
Bennett, the very existence of the group exempted from the entrance examination
is outrageous.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who was wearing
a thick acting mask, welcomed the battle with a terrific smile, even though she
was inwardly bitter.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, then,
since the rules are now settled. Can you sign this pledge form, please?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, hold on a
second."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen ran down the
pile of crystals with nimble movements and approached Nina. She wiped her mouth
with the back of her hand, and in response, the crystals that had filled the
area surrounding her began to disintegrate.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A large number of
crystals were converted into particles of light, which danced in the wind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The scene was so
majestic and picturesque. Nina learned for the first time that beauty, when
taken to the extreme, could be terrifying to behold.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen, on the other
hand, seemed unconcerned and completed the pledge form with a nonchalant
expression on her face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, there is no
going back for you or me. There is no use in having regrets."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Do I look like I
regret it?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Ha,
that's the way it should be."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though Nina tried
to play a monster-like sneer, Karen was not perturbed in the slightest. On the
contrary, she seemed to be gushing with excitement, which was terrifying.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina wondered to what
extent Karen had anticipated their plan.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other party is the
kind of person who hides his true identity while probing them. Naturally, the
other party would be capable of thinking like a liar, and they would not be the
type to neglect preparations before a fight.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Moreover, Nina had
already defeated Bennett Lohr.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This time, Nina
couldn't expect any development in which Karen would just give her a free kick
right from the start.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Ugh, I want to go home ......!</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is a part of her
in her head that is waving a white flag and crying out for help. That's for
sure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nina was also a
first-rate liar.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for the script, her
reliable accomplice already wrote it for her. All she had to do was play the
role of a liar who would deceive the world by pushing her true feelings behind
her facial muscles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The particles of light
that once filled the sky have all but dispersed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two liars met each
other's eyes head-on, and in them, they saw a flickering certainty of victory
and a hint of the most elaborate scheme.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Karen arrived at
the old school building where the &lt;duel&gt; would take place, she stepped
through the door with all the glass collapsed and entered the entrance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She walked down the
hallway and headed for the corner room at the east end of the first floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to the rules
agreed upon with Nina, they would enter the building with an interval of three
minutes between each other. In other words, the location of the enemy would not
be known at the time the &lt;duel&gt; began.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is the same as the
&lt;Practical Exam&gt; held recently. Despite the name of the game,
&lt;Hide-and-Seek&gt;, for Karen, it was nothing more than a demolition job.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her opponents at that
time surrendered before being crushed to death, however, this time would be
different.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all, her
opponent is Nina Stingray.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, what will
you do?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For Karen, who was
capable of tearing apart and crushing her opponents with crystals that multiplied
at a tremendous rate, indoors was an overwhelmingly advantageous battleground,
where escape routes were restricted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is doubtful whether
Nina and the others were aware of this when they designated this location.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But, undoubtedly, Nina
and the others have some kind of plan in place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Karen has
nothing to worry about. Her psychic ability has a hidden ability that is
unknown to most of the students.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Each of the crystals
that Karen creates is merely an inorganic object. They are like harmless pebbles
that can only be displayed in a room and admired.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, when they
grow to a certain size, they take on certain properties.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is a powerful
insulator.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It is not merely
immune to electricity. It completely blocks heat, vibrations, and even the
invisible energy generated during the activation of psychic abilities </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> in other words, it can even block psychokinesis. Of
course, she has never fought a user as powerful as Nina, but it is unlikely
that it would be completely ineffective.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In short, she is Nina's
natural enemy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how powerful
her opponent was, she would not fall behind in a head-on battle. If there is a
chance for the other side to win, it would only be through the pre-arranged
trap strategy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">And I have already anticipated the strategies that
they would try to pull off.</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Fellas, are you in
position?]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A mechanically
synthesized voice of a young boy could be heard coming from outside the window.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the tin cat
doll, brought to life by the psychic abilities of the school's headmaster, Jill
Will Weiser. He will be the witness at the duel.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jake, the witness, was
suspended in mid-air as if there was an invisible floor.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Let me check just to
make sure. You know the rules that are written in the pledge are absolute,
right? After the Bennett Lohr incident, most people seem to be adding a
prohibition against murder to the rules, but I assume you guys are fine with
this. ...... Ah, I see, you can't reply to me because you're hiding. I'll take
that as a yes.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen listened to the
tin doll's nonsense and sorted out the overall structure of the old school
building.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The building is
probably more than 100 years old. Brick construction. Four stories high.
Although it has been repaired many times by the instructor's psychic ability,
the materials of the building itself are badly dilapidated. Although she does
not know the exact square meters of the building, it is a little larger than
the first-year classroom building, which has four classrooms on each floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Well, it doesn't matter where Nina is hiding.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What she had to do had
already been decided.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Alright, let the
&lt;duel&gt; begin!]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the same time as
Jake's signal, Karen activated her psychic ability.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystal shards
generated at the tip of her outstretched palm began to multiply exponentially.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen inhaled deeply,
focusing on gathering power in the center of her body. She learned this
breathing technique from a bogus instructor to augment her abilities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The breathing
technique itself does not need any scientific basis. Through &lt;conditioning&gt;,
which she had repeated many times, she converted the series of movements
themselves into triggers to enhance her concentration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With this, the cluster
of crystals, which had been running out of control unnecessarily, could be
controlled.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen first decided to
manipulate the direction in which the crystals were multiplying.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since she was
currently in a first-floor corner room, there was no need to be aware of what
was behind her and what might be beneath her. The crystals gushed out in a
reverse conical direction toward the diagonal front, where the target to be
destroyed should be located.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No.1 Against a student
of the Heiberg School.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No.2 If he or Satya is
harmed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Through these two
levels of conditioning, the output limit of the &lt;Jolly Undertaker&gt; was
lifted. The crystals were growing faster and faster, and it was only a matter
of time before they reached their maximum output.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter where Nina
and her allies were hiding, the crystals would destroy the entire building in
less than ten minutes. Reflecting the blue light cast by the moon outside the
window, the surging waves of crystals shone with an ominous glow.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From above, the sound
of something exploding resounded.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mixed in with the
thunderous sound that shook the entire building was the high-pitched noise of
the crystals shattering.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What was that? Was that Stingray's psychic ability?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystals were
supposed to be immune to any kind of psychokinesis, but Nina's &lt;Queen of
Calamity&gt; is different, huh?</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good, very
interesting."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She found herself
enjoying this battle in a way that had nothing to do with her cause.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had sent many
students to the depths of despair through &lt;duels&gt; since enrolling at the
Heiberg School, but this was the first time she fought an opponent whom she
could not grasp.</span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I'll
grind you down until there is nothing remains."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a fierce smile on
the edge of her mouth, Karen increased the output of her psychic ability even
further.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Oh my gosh! This is bad, very bad!</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While holding her
mouth with both hands, Nina held back the scream that welled up inside her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The underground floor
began to vibrate with a terrifying rumbling sound, and the next moment a
cluster of pale, glowing crystals erupted from the first floor like a geyser.
The crystals were clad in sharp blades like the fangs of a giant creature, and
if someone were even slightly delayed in their evasion, they would surely have
been dismembered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's hope was being
chipped away with each passing second, and she felt as if her head were about
to spin out of control.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Stay still, do
you want to die that badly?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma, who was carrying
Nina in her arms, said calmly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wearing a mask, she
flew three-dimensionally around the corridor, leaving behind the proliferating
torrent of crystals at a tremendous speed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Flipping her body in
mid-air, Emma threw a general-purpose hand grenade - one that the Ashby family
mass-produces at their factory and that Emma has kept in her room - toward the
crystals. The pieces of iron scattered by the explosion shattered the
approaching crystals, but this did not buy them much time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all, the
crystals began to multiply again once they were destroyed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was like throwing a
pebble into an onrushing stormy sea, and any resistance she put up seemed
utterly futile in the face of such great power.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Is it really
enough to just run around throwing grenades!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Yeah, Jin
should be able to do the rest."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't trust
that guy as much as you do!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While clinging
desperately to Emma, who kept running while swearing, Nina thought back to a
line her accomplice had said before the operation began.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">There is a limit to one's brain's processing capacity.
The more elements one has to be wary of, the more sluggish one's judgment
becomes.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina and Emma's role
was to keep running away while pretending to counterattack with their psychic
abilities, and to put a load on the enemy's thought process.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They knew from prior
research that the crystals generated by Karen were immune to psychokinesis.
That's why, the mere sound of the crystals being destroyed would at least upset
Karen a little.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, this is
only a minor harassment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All of this is just a
stepping stone to ensure that the trump card prepared by Jin can be played.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I mean, how
could such an obvious violation go unnoticed by the witness?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin once told me
that Jake is just a sophisticated radio. It doesn't have a video recording
function, and with all these noises, it's impossible to hear our
conversation."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Damn it, he
could even find information that even I couldn't......" Emma swore even
more while dodging the crystals that were coming at her through the wall. "You
guys are insane. Have you always been fighting heretics like this?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unlike you, I
can't even use doping."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What a
madness."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had gotten used to
it, but surely it was reckless for ordinary people who were only good at lying
and acting to take on those monsters. Even Emma, who has better fighting skills
than them, stood her ground carefully so as not to get caught up in a needless
battle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">However, we had a solid chance of winning the battle.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although there was a
limitation that the candy had to be completely absorbed, Emma's enhanced
physical ability would never let the crystals catch up to her. Just as she
easily avoided the trap set by Nina and Jin in the past, she could also detect
a surprise attack through the walls and floor in advance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, there were
physical limitations to this plan as well, but Nina was not worried.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because they have a
reliable accomplice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina recalled the
whole plan that Jin had told her just a few minutes before in the hidden room
in the attic.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> 30 Minutes Ago </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">""[Forced
Deactivation]?""</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the hidden room in
the attic, Nina and Emma spoke in unison.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unable to comprehend
the meaning of the words that Jin dropped, Nina couldn't help but ask in
return.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm, what does
that mean......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've been
observing Karen's movements when she was doing the breathing technique training
at Nathan's dojo. Then I noticed that there was one gesture that Karen did
frequently whenever she deactivated her psychic abilities."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Ah, now
that you mention it!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin's mouth curled
into a smile.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Did you notice
it? Karen always wipes her mouth with the back of her hand whenever she
deactivates her psychic abilities. Perhaps that's the gesture she uses to
forcefully deactivate the &lt;Jolly Undertaker&gt;."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait a
minute," Emma interjected. "Wiping your mouth with the back of your
hand is a very common practice. It could just be a habit. Are you really going
to put your faith in that kind of uncertainty?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's
&lt;conditioning&gt;, Emma. Since you're an intelligence agent, you probably
know what it is, don't you?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen used
psychological &lt;conditioning&gt; to control her overly powerful psychic
abilities. That's the information she revealed herself back at the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has carefully
trained herself to automatically enter a deep state of concentration by
performing certain routines.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"To control her
psychic abilities, Karen has to trigger the &lt;Eastern Breathing Technique&gt;
to enter a state of concentration. If the psychic ability is so troublesome
that it can't be controlled without going that far, it's not strange to think
that a specific routine is required to disarm it, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......I think I
have a pretty good grasp of what you're trying to do. You're going to force
Karen to perform the routine that will force her to deactivate her psychic
ability, correct?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yet your face
still looks dissatisfied."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course I am.
...... How can you force her to wipe her mouth with the back of her hand in the
middle of a battle?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma's doubts were
understandable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would be reckless
to aim to trigger a forced deactivation in the face of an opponent who has a
tremendous gap in fighting ability.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would be like
praying for snow to accumulate in the desert. That kind of thing cannot be
called a strategy.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What if there is
another real gesture?" Jin said so with a look of conviction. "Well,
it's kind of hard to understand, huh? I guess it would be more appropriate to
say that wiping her mouth with the back of her hand is just a part of the
process of fulfilling the conditions."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you
mean?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's about
smell, Emma."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma still did not
seem to understand what he meant, but Jin explained in a straightforward
manner.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The first time I
felt something strange was about two weeks ago. I had a detective friend of
mine look around Karen's parents' house. It turned out that about once every
two weeks, a package from her parents' house was delivered to Karen's room in
the first girls' dormitory."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Probably Satya,
her maid, is the one who orders them. There were a lot of tea leaves and sweets
for the visitors in that room."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As Nina said, I
think it's just a consideration to make Karen's life at the school more
comfortable. There is nothing strange about that in itself. ...... But just to
be sure, I bribed the shipping company a bit to let me inspect the contents of
the package. I think it was about a week ago."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What a
scoundrel."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"Nothing like
that, I just had them show me the contents of the package. It contained tea
leaves, sweets, daily necessities like toothbrushes </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> and a bottle of perfume."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Perfume."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina unintentionally
repeated it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was nothing strange
that a female student would wear perfume. Even Nina sometimes secretly wore the
one that Jin had given her before.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What was wrong then?</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina, from your
point of view as a woman, ...... does Karen seem like the type of person who
would wear perfume?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Certainly, it's a little unexpected."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It might be easy to
overlook her well-groomed appearance, but come to think of it, Karen hardly
even wears any makeup.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is certainly
strange to find someone who is more devoted to the school's competition than to
beauty and fashion, wearing only perfume.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There are still
some strange points. On the bottle of perfume, there was a product labeled
&lt;Aeris No. 6&gt; but if I remember correctly, such a product doesn't exist.
After all, Aeris has only released perfumes up to No. 5. ......I'm guessing
it's a custom-made product that the Ashby family commissioned the manufacturer
to make."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"C-Custom-made?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In short, Karen
has an unusual preference for perfume, but Nina, how was it when you were
actually meeting her in person? Did you smell anything at all?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No, not
at all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If so, I have a
few guesses."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin said so while
tapping Karen's photo on the schematic diagram.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The only place
Karen puts on perfume is on the backs of her hands. And she uses such a small
amount that she can't smell it unless you put the back of her hand close to her
mouth. Why is that?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... To
prevent her from accidentally sniffing it during battle."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma's mutterings
seemed to be correct, and Jin pointed at her while snapping his fingers.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If we assume so,
it explains why Karen, who is so indifferent to fashion, went to the trouble of
ordering a custom-made one.  If there is
only one scent in the world, it would avoid silly situations where her opponent
happens to be wearing the same type of perfume and she can't activate her
psychic ability, wouldn't it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In other words,
if we can get her to smell the perfume, we can force her to deactivate her
psychic ability, huh. ...... Don't tell me, you did something like this with
Bennett as well? So your nullification ability is a scam which exploits the
weakness of your opponent's psychic ability?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, that's how
it is. You learned something new, right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a sarcastic smile
on his face, Jin took out a wooden box from a hidden compartment in the floorboards.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inside the box were
three cylinders the size of an index finger. Looking at the nozzles attached to
the tips of the cylinders, Nina and Emma understood what he was after.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"And that perfume
is in this spray. Our ultimate goal is to spray it at close range so Karen can
smell it. It's only a single shot, so handle it with care. The moment you miss,
it's game over."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin, you said
the perfume is custom-made, right? How did you get this stuff?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's a technique
called &lt;hollowing-out&gt;, whereby the liquid is extracted from an unopened
bottle. This is more the realm of a thief than a fraudster."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How many more
sins do you have to commit ......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, no, it's
just a few drops, you know? Something like this couldn't be counted as
theft."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma was struck with a
strange feeling as she listened to the conversation among the criminals
unfolding in front of her. In all the years she had devoted herself to the
benefit of the Republic, this might be the first time in her life that she had
ever felt such an emotion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">She is certainly feeling excited right now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only do these two
have no psychic abilities, but they have never even had proper combat training.
No matter how one looks at them, they do not possess the combat skills to
challenge these heretics head-on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, if Jin, who
possesses extraordinary insight, writes a detailed script, and Nina and Emma
enact it, they may be able to defeat these monsters with only the body of a
human being.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What's most
interesting for Emma is that they both seriously believe so.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Well, now
we have our cards in hand. Are you both ready?"</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen calmly watched
the old school building being destroyed by the proliferating crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fact that there
has been no declaration of victory by Jake yet probably means that Nina is
still running around in one piece.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps her enemy is
fleeing to the rooftop. She has likely decided that she can avoid being crushed
to death for the time being if she keeps climbing up using the crystals as a
foothold.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, she must have
at least realized that she could not run around forever.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to the rules
that Nina had set forth, defeat would automatically be decided as soon as they
were five meters away from the old school building.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she keeps running
around using the crystals as a scaffold, this rule will eventually strangle
her. The victory will be decided when the scaffold, which is constantly
increasing in scale, reaches a position five meters higher than the old school
building.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Considering the
current rate of growth, the time limit is just slightly over three minutes.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Come one, don't
make such a boring ending, will you?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her belief is to
thoroughly crush anyone who gets in the way. She has no desire to win by foul
play.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Well, I'm sure she'll try to pull a move on me before
that happens.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen is not
overconfident in her psychic abilities. Rather, she evaluates it as a
difficult-to-use ability whose only merit is its destructive power.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That is why she has
honed the art of calmly discerning the enemy's aims and dexterously maneuvering
around them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, he has also
read through the strategies that the other party would think of.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Look,
here it comes."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A noise was heard from
somewhere behind her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is a corner room
on the east end of the first floor. Naturally, there is only a window behind
Karen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So, she knew that the
enemy would attack from outside the building.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course,
that's the only opening I have!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one can predict
that Karen's target is the total destruction of the building, one can easily
determine her initial position. A location that does not require constant
vigilance in all directions and where there is no risk of being caught in the
collapse of the building - this could only be the west or east corner room on
the first floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one could foresee
that far, all one had to do was hide outside the window and look for an
opportunity for a surprise attack. The unnaturally loose rule of [one can be as
far as five meters from the old school building] was probably intended to make
this strategy work.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as per the image
she had prepared in advance, Karen sent a gush of pale, glowing crystals toward
the window.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The tip was sharpened
like a spear, a blow aimed to pierce the enemy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the attacker was
someone other than Nina, there would be no point in blowing them away by more
than five meters with the usual heavy attack.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the blow was
a dud.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no one
outside the window that Karen had attacked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">The noise is just a diversion ......!</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen finally realized
what the attacker was aiming for.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Rather, she wondered
why she had been unaware of it until now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Was it due to the
thunderous sounds of the crystals destroying the building?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Was she distracted by
Nina, who kept running away?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The enemy was not
lurking outside the window.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was only one
other place to hide that would not be crushed by the crystals.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Underground!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One of the wooden
floors beneath Karen's feet came loose, revealing a young boy clutching a spray
can.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps in a valiant
effort to keep his true identity from being discovered, the boy was wearing a
mask resembling that of a clown. But Karen's eyes could not be fooled.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I knew it was
you, Jin Kirihara!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For some reason, this
mysterious Easterner was always standing next to Nina, smiling fearlessly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He lunged toward her,
pointing the nozzle of his spray at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Ah, I see. Your nullification ability was a bluff,
huh?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen laughed
inwardly, confirming her previous guess.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was no big deal.
Jin Kirihara is simply exploiting a weakness in other people's psychic ability.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, obtaining
such information and taking countermeasures is a feat that no ordinary person
could ever pull off.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Fine, I
will accept your challenge."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a strangely calm
heart, Karen accepted the scent of flower petals being sprayed on her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the compressed
time, she thought back to the days when she was at peace.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a hard-fought
battle, Satya was always waiting for her when she returned to her room.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A hint of affection
behind her expressionless face. The many creative teas with experimental
blends. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">When was it
that I became embarrassed to express my gratitude to her for taking care of me?</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of Karen, a
boy walked slowly toward her, throwing the empty spray can behind him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Is that black object
in his hand a Taser? Karen recalled that a weapons manufacturer run by the
Ashby family had a similar product.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In a world where
everything seemed to be slow, Karen's consciousness was clear as day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then she said the decisive
words.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I knew all your
plans from the very beginning."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen took a deep
breath and entered a deep state of concentration, then thrust her right palm
forward.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The eyes peering
through the hole in the mask widened in astonishment when he saw the pale
crystal produced at the tip of her right palm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Nonsense, it
can't be.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Surely Karen
had already inhaled the scent of the perfume.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Such questions must
have been swirling around in his head. Karen could tell that much.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Indeed, sniffing
that custom-made perfume was a condition of deactivating my [Jolly Undertaker].
But that was only until a week ago. I've already changed the type of perfume I
use."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The torrent of
unleashed crystals engulfed Jin Kirihara's body.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even as his entire
body exploded like a water balloon, splashing red liquid all over the place,
she felt no guilt.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The narcotic secreted
in her brain makes her feel so ecstatic that she can hardly stand up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The pleasure of having
the upper hand. Karen was soaked from head to toe in such an aphrodisiac.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She turned a look of
pity on the reddish-black mass of flesh that was trapped inside the beautiful
tombstone.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Think about it.
Where in the world would an idiot keep using the same thing that the rats have
discovered?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">One Week Ago</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As usual, she was
inspecting the daily necessities delivered from the Ashby family when she found
something strange in a wooden box that she could not ignore.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Ashby family's
resident butler - Satya's father, Karen's personal maid - was a very meticulous
man, who respected a certain order when packing things into boxes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Heavy items such as
tea bags were placed on the bottom, and fragile items such as dishes and
bottles were wrapped in cloth or paper and placed on top. The arrangement of
the items was always the same, with the perfume &lt;Aeris no. 6&gt; sitting in
the center of them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, this
arrangement is clearly disordered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no way that
such a diligent butler could have been the cause of such a peculiar mishap. It
would also be unthinkable for the shipping company to change the arrangement on
its own.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Could it be that someone else had intervened?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It seemed like a
rather absurd notion, but she couldn't help but check.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first thing she
checked was the perfume.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At first glance, there
was nothing unusual about the jade-colored bottle containing the liquid. She
inspected it from all angles and held it up to the light to see if there was
any discrepancy.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... This
is."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She noticed that the
adhesive on the label wrapped around the bottle had shifted just a little.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, &lt;Aeris
no. 6&gt; is a custom-made bottle, hand-filled by artisans just for Karen. A
mistake of this magnitude would be acceptable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But on that day, she
could not miss the slightest change.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She peeled the
jade-colored bottle bare, peeling her fingernail across the small gap between
the tightly glued labels. In doing so, she discovered conclusive evidence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The label was covering
a hole so small that a needle could fit through it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The hole had been
sealed with a piece of glass of the same color, but there were clearly marks
where it had been forcibly glued in place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Was a poison injected into the needle?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No, what would be the point of putting something like
that in a perfume?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">The purpose is something more .......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It didn't take her
long to come to a conclusion.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Forced
Deactivation, huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen utilized several
&lt;conditioning&gt; techniques to control her overly powerful psychic
abilities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only did she
forcibly increase her concentration with breathing techniques she learned at
the shady dojo, but she also imposed on herself that she could only reach her
maximum output if she were to fight against students from the Heiberg School
who had harmed either her or Satya.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And then there comes
the perfume.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By smelling the
fragrance of this &lt;Aeris no. 6&gt;, she will be able to force herself to
stop before her psychic ability goes out of control.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Most likely, the enemy
took a few drops of the perfume from the bottle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is a shallow
strategy to soak a cloth with it or put it in a spray can and then approach her
during a &lt;duel&gt;.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You
filthy rats."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she could not
hide her surprise at the fact that someone would do such a thing a week before
she initiated the plan, she had nothing to fear once the seed of the trick had
been cracked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In short, all she has
to do is rewrite it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen is a genius at
self-brainwashing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Within a week from
now, it should be possible to &lt;re-condition&gt; herself using a different
perfume. Once that was done, it was time to take action.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she walked to the public
phone in the women's dormitory, she considered which perfume to choose with the
same ease she would consider a gift for a friend.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, an option
popped into her mind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Considering the time
required for conditioning training, the perfume should be ready by the end of
the day. If so, it couldn't be anything other than a popular product widely
available in the market.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She put her ear to the
phone and dialed the number of the shipping company.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The person that
answered the phone was clearly horrified. Perhaps he was bribed with money, but
someone so cowardly would not be suited for such treachery. Without needing to
interrogate him, her hypothesis was confirmed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She ruthlessly told
him to deliver the perfume to the dormitory by the end of the day, and that if
he betrayed her again, he would be dead, and slammed the phone down to further
incite fear.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The old school
building was no longer in its original form.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Swarms of
ever-expanding crystals have broken through the brick exterior walls from the
inside, causing sharp pale petals to bloom in the moonlit night. From afar, it
must have seemed like a magical sight.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To Emma, who had no
choice but to flee with Nina on her back, it looked as if the presence of death
that had materialized was approaching with tremendous force.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is no longer a
mere disaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike a mere natural
phenomenon, it is driven by the malevolence of a human being, and that is too
much to handle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two had already
escaped from the building, but the dreadful crystals had broken through even the
floor of the rooftop.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Emma, the
crystals!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't make a
fuss. I know."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only way out was
upward.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma jumped over to
the oncoming crystals. Even if the crystals kept multiplying, as long as she
was on top of them, she did not have to worry about being crushed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nevertheless, this is
just like clinging to a piece of driftwood to withstand the fury of a flood.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the face of the
mighty power of the heretics, even an agent who has undergone fierce training
since childhood is reduced to a helpless sheep.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If the tide
level reaches five meters above the old school building, it will be a violation
of the rules and you will lose. Are you okay with that?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry. The
crystals will stop multiplying soon."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That's
just what that guy said."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sure Jin can
read Karen's mind. I'm confident of it."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no way that
Karen, who was determined to crush them thoroughly, would be satisfied with a
foul victory. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, she would
surely stop the crystals in the middle of the game and approach them to put an
end to it herself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This speculation can
only be made by trusting in the psychology of a psychopath.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma, who had always
been very cautious, couldn't believe that they would act on such an assumption.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides, Jin
will defeat Karen soon."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why do you think
so highly of that-......~!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although there was
more to complain about, it didn't seem like the time to continue the
conversation any further.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One shadow came up the
mountain of crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma bit her lip.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the other party was
Jin, the crystals should have already disappeared. Besides, the &lt;duel&gt;
was supposed to be a one-on-one battle between Nina and Karen, so it would not
make sense for Jin to meet them before the duel ended.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... We need
to hide."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">The only thing you should always assume is the
worst-case scenario.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's what her boss
always told her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara failed to
complete his mission and was killed by Karen Ashby.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In an instant, Emma
interpreted this as the entirety of what had just happened.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma went around
behind the crystals that protruded like the tip of an iceberg. Here, she would
be in a blind spot from the approaching figure.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know you're
hiding there. Nina Stingray."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all this
movement. Emma's breathing had become so ragged that it was inevitable that her
position would be discovered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if mocking Emma,
who was spinning her brain looking for an escape route, Karen went on in a
nonchalant manner.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you sure you
want to just run around forever? How can you face your brothers of the
&lt;White Knights&gt; if you keep running away? If you're a psychic, If you're
a psychic, you should fight me head-on and with dignity."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma felt fear for the
first time in a while when she heard the voice bubbling with excitement.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had heard this
story many times from her compatriots. It is a common trait among heretics who
are intoxicated by their own power to enter a state of mania immediately after
killing someone.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin Kirihara was
much braver still. He had the guts to approach me, even though he was using
tricks. On the other hand, what about you, Stingray? Don't tell me you've been
pretending to be the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;? Look, I'm right here. Come on,
show yourself."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Mighty power always
begets insanity.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If we trace the
history of mankind, there is no more universal truth than this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nerves numbed by the
destruction they themselves have wrought, the guilt of breaking the taboo of
murder easily ebbs away. In the Republic, this is a realm that cannot be
reached without thoroughly brainwashing new recruits through six months of
training using &lt;conditioning&gt;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is why psychic
abilities are so terrifying.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without any special
training, they can turn a 15-year-old girl into such a monster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I have to stop them.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before the empire used
these terrifying monsters to take over the world.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before the world is
rewritten into hell.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For that, I must
survive at all costs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She turned her
attention to the girl who was trembling, her shoulders hunched against her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Right, ....... If I sacrifice this girl, I'm sure I'll
be able to save myself.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is also the
possibility that Nina, after being caught, might reveal her true identity. If
she wanted to be safe, she should push her off the rooftop and then run away.
If she could make it seem that Nina had thrown herself off the roof because she
could not bear the fear, then everything would be all right.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As an agent of the
Republic, this would certainly be the best course of action for her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, what came out
of her mouth was a completely opposite suggestion.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What the hell
am I saying?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Make the right
choice for the benefit of the Republic.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Reason admonished her
again and again. But still, her emotions refused to make the cruel choice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The innocent [Emma]
personality is unaware of her existence, but not the other way around. She has
had a front-row seat to Emma's happy routine in the classroom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina has been sitting
next to her and smiling at her with an unsuspecting smile,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The figure of Jin
watching her with a cynical expression on his face,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has been watching
so closely.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Every day, day in and
day out, to the point of exasperation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But that didn't mean
she was capable of being ruthless to the very end </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> she felt herself unfit to be a spy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps she had
somehow been influenced by that innocent girl. before she knew it.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......I'll leave
the rest to you, Nina."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She said this and was
about to get up when she saw something unbelievable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">How could this
be possible under these circumstances?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">How could she
still look like this?</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay,
Emma."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With tears in her
eyes, she still has a strong resolve to believe in hope.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has not given up
on anything yet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She unabashedly
believes that her accomplice is still alive, that they can defeat that
terrifying monster, and that they can fool the world.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two fraudsters are
bound together by a mutual trust that is so strong.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wa-......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without hearing her
words, Nina leaped out from behind the crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her back was too
dazzling for Emma, who had been living in darkness for so long.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen's thoughts were
thrown into chaos when she saw a figure jump out from behind the crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Why are you here?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In the first place, you shouldn't be a student of this
school.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There she saw Kate
Lambert, with whom she had recently undergone breathing technique training at
the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was moving her
head around restlessly, looking at her surroundings, as if she had wandered in
by a series of bad coincidences.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh......? It's
Karen."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a look as if she
had found a boat of salvation, Kate approached her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's strange, no
matter how one thinks about it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fact that she is
not even a student at the Heiberg School and is here at this place is a false
assumption to begin with.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's a disguise. This person in front of me is Nina
Stingray.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen's thinking
ability to arrive at that answer in an instant was indeed outstanding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, whether or
not her body would accept the conclusion she reached in her head was another
story.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even when she held out
her palm toward Kate, she could not generate crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So she cursed the
mistake she had made in the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that time, she had
taught Kate a fatal truth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fatal weakness
that restricted her psychic abilities to anyone but the students of the Heiberg
School.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though Karen was
being approached by the girl with a spray can in her hand, and even though her
mind was aware of all the truth, her body, her nerves, and her deepest psyche
could not recognize the girl in front of her as an enemy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That is how impressive
Nina's acting is.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina is a monster in
every sense of the word, for she can pull off such divine deception even when
every circumstance is conspiring to expose her lies.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's wrong,
Karen, you look pale."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Kate approached her
with a look of worry on her face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you're having
a hard time, I'm here to listen, okay?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Step by step, the
monster closed the distance nonchalantly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't have
to be so uptight. Feel free to tell me anything."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The nozzle of the
spray was brought close to the tip of her nose.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know full well
that you're actually a kind person."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Who are you?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Who are you?
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?</span></i><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aaaaaaarrghh!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen snapped out of
her stupor before the nozzle shot out a spray of liquid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She pointed her palm
in the opposite direction and let the crystals spurt out. Thin, long, and
sharp.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What she produced was
a single long sword.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she couldn't crush
her directly with the crystals, she could attack her with a weapon made of
crystals. Simple and effective logic, Karen had come up with in less than a
second.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Nina
Stingray."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To identify her as her
enemy, Karen chose to utter that name.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know it,
you're a damned fraud. About you being the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt; is also a
lie. All you can do is form a gang, put on a disguise, and use such tricks to
trick me - you are a coward."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen swung her long
sword with both hands and knocked the spray can out of Nina's hand with the tip
of her sword.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After taking a glance
at the spray can, which rolled on the crystals with a dull sound, Karen filled
her whole body with murderous intent.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But I still
respect you for being such a coward. You sure were strong."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Aiming precisely at
the heart of the girl whose eyes were wide open, a merciless thrust was
unleashed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen has dreamed of
becoming a hero of the empire since she was a child, and she has not neglected
her physical training.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no way Nina
can evade the attack.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A mere ordinary girl
would not even be able to react.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A pale flash of light
slices through the air at a tremendous speed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sharp tip was
thrust into her left chest,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Right before it struck
her</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From behind Karen, a
boy's voice could be heard.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unfortunately,
you've lost."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sword suddenly
lost its strength and shattered from the tip due to air resistance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not just the
sword. The cluster of crystals that had filled the rooftop and destroyed the
old school building from the inside out were transformed into pale particles
with a sound similar to a torrential downpour.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What grazed her nose
was a refreshing citrus scent - a new [Forced Deactivation] that had been
hastily changed about a week ago.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You're so
slow, Jin. That was a close call."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl in front of
her was laughing as she wiped tears from the corners of her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What reflected in her
eyes was a boy wearing a clown's mask. Karen didn't know why he was here, as he
was supposed to have been killed before her eyes earlier.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You were wearing
a stab-proof vest, remember? You'll be fine even if you get stabbed a
little."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......That's not
the problem, though."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A stab-proof vest?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen looked at the
girl's figure with confusion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Certainly, the outline
of her body seemed to have swelled a little. Her body shape is clearly
different from when they met at the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No way, had he
read through even my last-ditch plan?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No, there is a
bigger problem.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">How is this guy still alive?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No...... how does he even know my latest [Forced
Deactivation] in the first place?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A first-rate
fraudster has even the deepest psyche under his control."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Amidst the noises of
collapsing crystals, the boy cruelly went on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"For the past few
weeks, you've had certain information imprinted on your psyche. For example,
through the small talk of the girls you passed by. Or the outdoor advertisements
on the way to the dojo. Or the scent of Kate Lambert, who you befriended at the
dojo."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No
way."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, you figured
it out already? You sure are a quick thinker."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a round of
deliberate applause, Jin pulled out an amber-colored vial from somewhere.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I believed in
you from the very beginning. You're a cautious person, so I'm confident that
you'll realize that the contents of &lt;Aeris No. 6&gt; have been extracted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When you realize
you're being tricked, you'll naturally feel the need to change your perfume,
right? However, it would take time to change your &lt;conditioning&gt; to a
completely different routine, and it would be difficult to make a new custom
order.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, changing the
perfume is only for a short period of time until you defeat Nina. If that's the
case, it's better to quickly buy a perfume that can be obtained at any time and
start the &lt;conditioning&gt; process right away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then I'd better act
quickly. Now, what kind of perfume should I choose?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When you think like
this, the first thing that comes to your mind must be &lt;Glow Citrus&gt;.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's a popular product
among first-year girls, and you often see it on billboards on your way to the
dojo. And you recalled that Kate Lambert, who you recently befriended at the
dojo, was also wearing one.......</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, the trend in the
school is the result of information manipulation that I orchestrated, and the
billboard was posted without permission only when you walked by, not to mention
Kate is none other than Nina in disguise - but when you chose the perfume, you
couldn't possibly have known that, could you?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As an insurance, I had
a detective tailing the shipping company you hastily arranged for, ...... but
it looks like my plan to guide you was a success."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen could hardly
wrap her head around Jin's words.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All she understood was
that she had been involved in a hell of a scam. But her brain refused to
comprehend any more than that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she gets the whole
picture right, she might go crazy with fear.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">She couldn't possibly
have known that everything had been in this man's hands from the very beginning</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... H-How the
hell did you survive in the first place?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You know what,
you think I'm going to answer everything?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-You
......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Look, Jake's
flying over here. Let's get this all over with before he hears something
weird."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin came closer to her
with his hands in his pockets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen didn't realize
until the last minute that it was a diversion to get her attention.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A sharp pain shot up
her neck.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The last thing she saw
was another person wearing a mask. She had no recollection of this person, who
was dressed in a black coat with a hood.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Just what kind of scam am I in......?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without anyone to
answer her question, her consciousness sank into the darkness.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin! Thank God
you're okay......!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as the witness
declared Nina's victory and flew away, her emotions broke down at once.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who had taken
off her disguise, hugged Jin, shedding large tears.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gosh, why didn't
you tell me you had a secret plan!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without waiting for a
response from her accomplice, Nina let out her overflowing feelings as they
were.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I won't be mad
at you just because your gift to me was part of the plan......!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she said this, she
inwardly knew it was a naive wish.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It wasn't that Jin had
kept quiet about it in order not to hurt Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason why Jin did
not tell her about the final strategy was probably because of his concern
regarding Emma. She is not a master of acting like Nina, and it was risky to
tell her about the possibility that Jin was still alive. Even though she hid
her face behind a mask, there was no guarantee that Karen would not notice the
slightest change in her demeanor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By making the other
party believe that they've seen through your plan, you can make the final move
that even your allies don't know about - it's Jin's usual tactic, which he also
used when he defeated Bennett before.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm so glad
you're alive ...... Jin."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without saying a word,
her accomplice held Nina in his arms and patted her trembling back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There, for the first
time, Nina realized the fact that she had unconsciously embraced him. The blood
running down the surface of her face felt as if it was about to boil.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, this
embarrassment was strangely comforting.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You
guys," Emma muttered in a tone that made no attempt to hide her dismay. "What
are you doing flirting at a time like this?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"F-Flirting......!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma shrugged her
shoulders at Nina, who hurriedly pushed Jin away.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The old school
building is at its limit. If we don't get out of here soon, we'll be caught in
the collaps-......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before she could
finish, Emma went completely rigid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even with her mask on,
her agitation could not be more apparent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What? What is
Emma shocked to see right now?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina followed her line
of sight while repeatedly denying the bad premonition in her mind.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... It's a
lie, right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen, who should have
fainted due to the stun gun pressed against her neck earlier, was already
standing up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina instantly
realized that Karen had defended herself with the crystals.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Though it seemed that
she was not able to block it perfectly because Emma caught her off guard, at
least Karen was spared from fainting. Holding her neck with her hand, she
walked slowly toward the three of them, confident of victory.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... o-,
rry."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen was whispering
something over the noises of the old school building collapsing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The words became
clearer as the distance between them closed in with each step.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sorry."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A weak voice, like a
child clinging to her mother's apron.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sorry I
couldn't kill the rats. I'm sorry I carelessly fell into their scheme. I'm
sorry I didn't live up to your expectations. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She looked so
different from the Karen Nina had seen at the school and at the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps this is her
true self.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A martyr who is so
enthralled by, reliant on, and willing to sacrifice herself to a powerful being
that she would not even think twice about it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's analysis was
affirmed by the words that followed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I will at
least make amends by taking these lowly rats down with me."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen pulled out a
palm-sized black lump from the pocket of her uniform.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the same one
Emma was using just a few minutes ago.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A general-purpose
grenade manufactured by the Ashby family</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"She's going to
blow herself up!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin shouted while
still wearing his mask, but it was already too late.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without the slightest
hesitation, Karen pulled out the pin of the grenade.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She quietly closed the
curtains after confirming the explosion that had engulfed the roof of the
half-destroyed old school building.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After all, it was a
good decision to let Karen Ashby have a grenade for suicide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how
well-matched she was with Nina Stingray in terms of psychic abilities, there
was no guarantee that the other party would give her a fair fight. If she and
Jin Kirihara, who acted in the role of a conspirator, were to make a devious
plan, there was every danger that they would catch her off-guard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, Karen was
nearly defeated by the three rats who had formed a party.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was aware of the
general situation through the wiretap Karen was carrying. Although they were
able to see through the trick of exploiting the [Forced Deactivation] and
should be able to crush Jin Kirihara with the crystals, they could not have
foreseen this outcome.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In short, their
opponents were a cut above the rest.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Well, I
should say it was a close call."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If Karen were caught
and tortured, it would be a big problem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though Karen did
not know her true identity, there was a possibility that she would blurt it out
to escape the suffering. If that were to happen, it would inevitably lead to
troublesome rumors spreading throughout the school, making it difficult for her
to move in the future. Above all, she couldn't leave dangerous people who could
defeat such a monster unattended.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That was why it was an
insurance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was painful to lose
the pawn that she had spent so many years brainwashing, but it was worth it
considering that her pawn was able to take troublesome rats down along with
her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to the
various pieces of information she had obtained so far, Emma Licorice is most
likely to be a spy for an enemy country. The fact that she was clearly agitated
by the message written on the blackboard that day suggested that this
speculation was correct.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She did not know how
Nina Stingray and Jin Kirihara ended up cooperating with her, but that was no
longer important.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All of the suspects
were involved in Karen's suicide just now. And they had all tragically died
instantly, pierced to death by pieces of iron blown off by the blast.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For now, she had to
think about how she was going to report this to the headmaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she could convince
him that those three were spies sent by the enemy - the Republic, for example -
there would be no problem for the time being. Although the fact that Nina
Stingray is a relative of a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt; is somewhat
troublesome, it might be possible to emphasize her loyalty by creating a story
in which she removed the disgrace of a prominent family instead. She could
fabricate any number of pieces of evidence later.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She knew her place in
the pecking order.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Among the many
&lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; in the school, she is nothing more than a minor
existence, having recently enrolled in the school this year. Naturally, she is
not even in a position to talk to him directly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That is why she needs
something to boost her reputation, and this case is a good opportunity for her
to do so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She took out a sheet
of white paper from the bag she had hidden under her bed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the same sheet
of paper as the pledge form that the students would fill out when they were to
engage in a &lt;duel&gt;. She would only need to write the necessary
information on it and then sign it to convey a message to the school principal.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she was wondering
what to write on the form, she felt like a female student writing a love letter
to her crush. In fact, adoration and loyalty may well be similar emotions.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, a knock on
the door of her room forced her to stop her pen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is already ten
o'clock at night. She wondered if someone was visiting at this time of night.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The door is a sliding
door, but it is locked securely from the inside. It was safe for the time
being, but she could not help but be on her guard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She put the paper back
in her bag and hid it under the bed again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After taking a breath
and pulling her gun out from under her pillow, she headed for the door.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Who is
it?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no answer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as she was
beginning to wonder if the knocks were an auditory hallucination, she heard
something dislodge from inside the door.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No way, did someone just pick the lock?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In her confusion, she
hesitated whether she should hold up her gun or hide it behind her back. In the
end, she chose the latter - but her decision was completely wrong.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The door that should
have been locked was opened and the person who appeared was the same person who
was supposed to have been killed in the explosion on the roof of the old school
building just a few minutes ago.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I believe this
is the first time we've met in person."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara was
smiling viciously as he turned his dark, black eyes toward her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; - no, Satya Rodel-san?"</span></p>
