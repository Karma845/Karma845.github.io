<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; A Lawless Person</h3>


<p>「I’m extremely worried about Filaret at this precise moment. I’m so worried that I feel
like my chest is ripping apart. There’s no way that I can calm down in a
situation like this. So, I&#8217;d like to tell you this. If by any chance he does
something bad to Filaret…I’m going to make him my enemy.」</p>



<p>The underground temple
was a dim and gloomy space. Only a little light illuminated the immediate
surroundings. Caria Burdnick was looking at her little white fingers. Upon
hearing those words, Caria twisted her eyebrows.</p>



<p>It was strange. No,
or it was rather normal? However, she couldn’t understand his feelings
completely.</p>



<p>Helot Stanley. He
was, undoubtedly, a man of righteousness. His words were made of authenticity.
If one had to choose between trust and doubt, trust would be the correct
answer.</p>



<p>However, they’ve
met only a few days ago. This
was the first time they had the opportunity to have a serious dialogue. Nevertheless,
it was strange and confusing. She wondered why she felt like this. Why did it
feel as if his words were so correct? The moment he declared that Lugis could
harm Filaret La Volgograd, Caria’s brain began questioning if his judgement were
true.</p>



<p>「…Let’s not jump into conclusions yet. If that really happens, then I’ll give him the
necessary punishment he deserves.」</p>



<p>「Let’s pray that my
sincere words are justified. 」</p>



<p>Despite his words,
Caria was not easily swayed. Decisions had to be made only when necessary.</p>



<p>What an outrageous
remark. This ambiguous, misdemeanant and odious conversation was something she
truly hated. Weird feelings indeed. How could their conversation turn into
something so
serious? And why was he so
confident of his distrust. The exact reasons seemed a bit irrational.</p>



<p>Just like Helot declared,
Lugis wasn’t in
fact, a good person. He did great things, yes. But, he also did questionable things as well. It seemed
that Lugis knew how to trick other people. Helot expressed his feelings by
saying that it was odd for a commoner like Lugis to accompany someone from a
higher class like me.
The relationship that we
shared was indeed a strange one. It was as if Helot was implying that
Lugis had ulterior motives. As if he had a different purpose to stay by my side.</p>



<p>Ah, the confusion
came again. What if, what
Helot Stanley said was correct?</p>



<p>This was not
something to be resolved by intuition. Everything was puzzling. The best
approach for this type of situation was to follow the path that seemed the most righteous one to follow.</p>



<p>「What’s wrong, Miss Caria? 」</p>



<p>She was deeply immersed in her thoughts, when something
happened abruptly. Her feet stopped naturally. A little light shined upon a shadowy figure
exposed on the cobblestone.</p>



<p>She tried calling out the figure,
but nothing came out from the wall. There was nothing there. Or so, it seemed. They were the only
ones there. Of course, there wouldn’t be anyone else here. Besides Caria, only Helot’s presence could be seen from the
little tiny light coming
through. In this
dim light, it wouldn’t be uncommon for the eyes to see what wasn’t there.
Yes, that’s right her eyes
were playing tricks on her. They were the only ones there… Could that assumption be wrong?</p>



<p>When Caria lifted her face from the
ground, something moved from the corner of her eyes for a very brief moment.</p>



<p>It was a shadow. The
shadow moved and defied the light. It formed a silhouette that Caria’s eyes
could grasp.</p>



<p><em>…What a wonderful occurrence to be able to hear the words of those who
receive the favor of God.</em></p>



<p>It was really a
shadowy figure. That shadow spoke directly to Caria. She understood its words
as they echoed inside her ears.</p>



<p>It was impossible.
Caria blinked her eyes and her throat swallowed dry.</p>



<p><em>…If you’re going to push yourself to the limits, then
have your way, Caria Burdnick. Be like a domesticated sheep that will follow
the shepherd blindly and fall directly into a cliff. Don’t think about anything
and don’t question anything.</em></p>



<p>The shadow’s words were rough,
like they were spoken in
rainy storm. It was as if something impossible was happening right in
front of her eyes. Like a dream, or a nightmare. Her body didn’t move, it was frozen still, and
words didn’t come out from her mouth.</p>



<p>Yet, the words coming out of this shadowy figure were
unperceivable. In her mind, Caria gritted her teeth even
though she couldn’t move at all.</p>



<p><em>…That path would be full of bliss. Drown. Just make
yourself drown. Okay, let’s do it together. Let’s throw away any reasons or
confusing feelings!</em></p>



<p>Shut up. That’s
what she wanted to say, but her words didn’t come out from her mouth. Still, her mouth
trembled slightly.</p>



<p>Caria’s body burned
like poison from the tip of her toes to the end of her hair. Her heart boiled
with heat. Her expressionless face tried to move desperately.</p>



<p>Her silver eyes
were undeniably burning with rage. Yes, this was a desperate situation. Unwanted feelings kept
entering Caria’s earlobes. What was that shadow? This was ridiculous. Yes, an
extremely ridiculous occurrence.</p>



<p>Words kept coming. They
were far from being pleasant. They didn’t get out from Caria’s mind. Her head
hurt. It didn’t stop. It told
her that she broke the rules of her Guild by entering the forbidden forest without
permission. As someone from the Knight class, she had been living an excessively
free life. A
liberated life, unbound by rules and orders.</p>



<p>Inside Caria’s
mind. She heard ridicule laughing from all over the world, mocking her.</p>



<p><em>…Who do you think I am? I know everything about you.
Caria, the one who abandoned her home. The lawless one Foolish Caria.</em></p>



<p>Caria screamed
inside her mind. She despised the shadow’s words and tried to get it out from
her head.</p>



<p>Caria moved her
shoulders slightly. Strangely, her body started to move once again. The shadow
stopped speaking inside her mind. Was it an auditory hallucination? Or was it
really the words of a shadowy figure? What was the truth? She didn’t know what
on earth just happened.</p>



<p>Everything was
dubious. But, what was said about her was the undeniable truth. Everything that
happened to her was correct. But,
she heard her deeds in a very mocking, confusing and hateful way. It sounded as if the shadow
tried to break down her self-confidence.</p>



<p>「…Okay, I decided about what you said early on. If Lugis had bad
intentions, he would’ve done something to her already.」</p>



<p>Caria started to
move forward and spoke directly to Helot. Still, she was still feeling confused
about the weird occurrence that happened moments ago. Her existence itself was godly and it
radiated with an unmistakable heat.</p>



<p>「I guess so. But, because of that oath, Filaret won’t be able to do anything
against him. No matter what other people may say, I think this is not a laughable
situation. I should
have been the one
to take responsibility during that time. I should have stopped Filaret from accepting that
oath. I blame myself for it…I really didn’t want to be involved with you
people.」</p>



<p>「I see. 」</p>



<p>So, that’s how he
truly felt. Caria moved her body. She touched her silver hair and swayed the
sword at her back.</p>



<p>「I’m sorry but I can’t agree with everything you said. I won’t argue
about what you truly think of him. But, that person saved my life and defended
my honor.」</p>



<p>Lugis helped Caria
during the fight against the large beast monster. Besides that, he stood by her
side against her father
in Fort Colliden… And then,
he managed to get her out of confinement from the Burdnick house.</p>



<p>If this was put in
perspective, then one could say that everything was too lawless. Really, he was far from being a
righteous and good person. But, Caria smiled because she knew about Lugis’ good
side too.</p>



<p>It was a graceful
and genuine smile. A smile that softened a person’s heart. It was indeed a warm
and sunny smile.</p>



<p>It was odd coming
from a person like Caria. But, if she truly felt that way, then it was real. She pulled out her silver long sword.</p>



<p>「I’ve decided. He is the person who brought me this far. And I was the one who
decided to take his hand. That means that I’ve chosen to take his side…because we are
comrades after all.」</p>



<p>Her heart burst.
Caria expressed her true feelings. Yes, that’s how she really felt about Lugis.
Her confusion about this matter disappeared as if heavy shackles were taken off
from her body. However, if it was not love per se, then it was some other sort of affection.
An affection hard to express in words or colors. That’s why she said they were
comrades. She believed in that and it was an easy way to express her affection
for him.</p>



<p>Inside the dark and
dim underground passage. Caria pulled her silver sword and Helot looked astonished at her
with wide opened
eyes. Both of them were quietly facing each other.</p>
