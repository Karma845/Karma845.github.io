<h3>Chapter 42 &#8211; Obsession </h3>

<p>「You have
three sins, did you know about that? 」</p>



<p>She held up her thin finger to my
throat to express her bursting feelings. I narrowed my eyes and I swallowed dry. My brain twisted in a confusing
manner after I heard Caria’s questioning. I tried to find an answer for her
question, but I became even more confused.</p>



<p>Only a tiny air circulated through my throat. It wasn’t enough to supply
my lungs with oxygen. My lungs ached with pain because of the lack of air. My
body lost strength and my limbs became dormant. I didn’t feel that great and I was about to lose my consciousness.</p>



<p>What was this feeling? It was true that Caria was a woman capable of
behaving rashly and cold-hearted like this. But, there was always some sort of distance between her
and me. I always knew what to expect of her nasty words.</p>



<p>Yet, a sin. I didn’t have any memory of it. I tried to recall my
memories of the past timeline. Then, I tried to remember what happened so far
on the present timeline. Still, I didn’t remember having any guilty feelings
towards Caria.</p>



<p>The sight of my eyes’ pupils was slightly blurred. The confusion spread
further on my body. My brain became dull as if blood stopped circulating
through my veins.</p>



<p>I was unable to understand the meaning
of her words. Her piercing talk
managed to make me feel bad with myself even though I didn’t know the reason
why. It looked as if her hand was choking my throat. This feeling was
unmistakably true. This was not a joke or fluke. Seriously, this woman was
trying to make me go mad.</p>



<p>「You’re
not sure? I’ll tell you…The first one…my “comrade” didn’t care about me and
acted on his own without asking for my advice. Twice now.」</p>



<p>Caria added that she forgave me once. It was as if she wanted to show me
her generous side. However, her smile was rather cold. Bittersweet in fact.</p>



<p>I rounded my eyes when I received her words by nodding slightly.</p>



<p>I understood to some extent. I considered her my comrade and I changed
things as I pleased. Most probably, the first time was when I accepted
Filaret’s request. After that, the second time was with the negotiations between
the Heraldic people without considering them with Caria.</p>



<p>Her chin quivered and her hard expression said it all. I understood why
she nominated my sin for those reasons alone. Still, this situation made me feel
quite uncomfortable. Even if I tried to speak, I could only make a strange
hoarse sound that echoed from my dry and constricted throat.</p>



<p>Then, Caria loosened her expression when she became convinced of my
reaction.</p>



<p>「Then,
your second sin. This time you’re putting that Sorceress at the center of your
plan. You gave her a chance to participate directly on this scheme while you
put me behind the scenes. What do you have to say about his, huh?」</p>



<p>Finally, the power behind
her thin finger pointed into my throat weakened.</p>



<p>New air went inside of my throat. My esophagus felt a quivering feeling
of fresh air coming through. Then, my lungs began to act fervently as they took
the new air.</p>



<p>On this moment, I felt a swirl of confusing feelings running on my mind.
I wondered if I remained sane or not. I questioned whether my thoughts were
intact. Everything that happened here felt like torture. This was nostalgic.
Yes, a state of fear and horror that I was familiar with from the past
timeline.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, her finger still touched my throat. But, her touch was
relaxed now. If I made a mistake, this could cost me dearly. Everything I might
say, could damage Caria’s mood.</p>



<p>At this time, I felt something strange about all of this on my heart.</p>



<p>What? Something felt off. Why was she so full of rage and hatred? This
situation was too different when compared to the former Caria during the salvation journey. Of
course, her behavior
changed as she aged, but even so, something was clearly off this time.</p>



<p>Obsession. Yes, her past fixation. I would never forget it anymore. I
remember clearly how obsessed she was with Helot Stanley. Still, her current tantrum made her
behavior a lot worse than what it was in the past.</p>



<p>I slowly opened my mouth to speak some words without hurting my throat
too much.</p>



<p>「Ugh…Ah.
You’re wrong. As far as I can see, Filaret is someone with a fragile heart. If
I let her go without paying much attention, she’s likely to “collapse” unless I
take care of her.」</p>



<p>Actually, not quite so.</p>



<p>In fact, that girl was a polar opposite of her future self. Filaret La
Volgograd from the journey of salvation was different from the one of this
timeline.</p>



<p>She was a fierce girl no matter what happened. She always stood by
herself and always showed to others what she was capable of doing. She had the
aura that made people feel small against her. She had cunning eyes that were
able to see through the inner self of other people.</p>



<p>However, if you looked closely at the present day Filaret, she behaved like a young tree
that needed something to lean on. She wouldn’t be able to even imagine standing by
herself. It made me feel that I had to watch over her back because she felt
hopeless.</p>



<p>I was sure that Filaret was brilliant. A great talented person. Still,
this Filaret was still a diamond in rough. It would be irresponsible of me to
leave someone like her alone.</p>



<p>Ah, or maybe I was wrong about it. In fact, it could’ve been otherwise.
Perhaps, Filaret leaned on that man’s back during the journey of salvation
without me realizing it. I wondered if her attitude remained the same after
all.</p>



<p>「But,
Caria. You’re different from her. You’re a strong woman. That’s what I really
think of you. You are a reliable woman that can even slice the devil’s neck on
your own. Besides…」</p>



<p>When I professed those words, I got a weird feeling on my body. I felt
that the power of my hands disappeared temporarily. Of course, it wasn’t
anything too serious. Caria said, 「Besides
what? 」
She questioned my reasons while I tried to explain to her why I put her behind
the scenes and not that girl Filaret.</p>



<p>「You’re a
very proud person. Even if you dislike me, once you’ve made a promise with me,
you’ll never betray me. I know you too well.」</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the only thing I knew and truly believed.</p>



<p>During my days of the rescue party, she was arrogant, unreasonable and
violent with me. But, those days were my past and her future. That’s why she
didn’t remember it.</p>



<p>However, I did remember those days myself. I remember that a woman named
Caria was a very proud woman that carried her will earnestly. Despite all of
her big flaws, she was a great woman on that regard.</p>



<p>For a brief moment, her silvery eyes became wide open. She quivered her
lips as well. She wasn’t prepared to hear such words coming from my mouth. She
was oblivious of how much I knew about her.</p>



<p>「I see.
You speak as if you know me personally. But, I doubt that you gained this
wisdom so soon. So, tell me. Why do you believe that I won’t betray you? Why do
you think I’m that reliable to being with? Why do you think that deeply about
my persona?」</p>



<p>「I
already told you before. 」</p>



<p>Caria’s reaction. She stared at me with suspicious eyes. But, it
couldn’t be helped though. I just had to do my part in other to appease her unsettled feelings.</p>



<p>「Because
you are Caria Burdnick…No. Because it’s you, Caria. 」</p>



<p>Caria thought deeply about what I’ve just said to her. Then, she
narrowed her eyes and smiled a little as if she were satisfied with my answer.</p>



<p>「I accept
that…I might not be a knight anymore, but I still have the respect and loyalty
of a noble. Therefore, if I make a promise with someone, I’ll give them my
trust and allegiance.」</p>



<p>At last, my throat became clear and I was able to breathe normally
again. I was finally released from the claws of the devil. I thought that I was
living on hell. My strength returned and I felt a relief coming of my
shoulders.</p>



<p>I didn’t know if my reasoning was enough. But, at least, it looked like
I convinced her somehow.</p>



<p>When I stared at Caria’s face…I noticed that her silvery eyes were too
close to my face. We were so close to each other, that I could feel our
breaths. Our foreheads almost collided with one another. My throat throbbed
spontaneously.</p>



<p>「Well, I
hope you haven’t forgotten.
But, you have three sins…Third. You seem to be hiding something from me. Your
actions and words are weird and unusual sometimes. Even if you have a hidden
purpose, you act somewhat suspiciously sometimes. If you want to work alongside
me as a fellow comrade, don’t you think it’s necessary to break the walls between us? Why
don’t you speak now whatever
you’re hiding from me, huh?」</p>



<p>Caria’s expression was daunting. No wonder that our faces were so close
to one another. She made this move so that I wouldn’t move my gaze away from
hers. She grinned with that demonic expression on her face as if she
intentionally pushed her comrade into a corner of hell.</p>
