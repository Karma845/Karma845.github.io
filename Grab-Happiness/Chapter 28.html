<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; A Sincere Person</h3>


<p>Was she just buried in the wall
or was she swallowed inside? Caria
Burdnick tried to trace any
abnormalities on the wall by touching the wall surface with her tiny
white fingers. She looked extremely focused. She wrinkled her eyebrows while
she stared fixedly at the wall with a strange expression. There were no signs
that indicated that the wall trap would be activated again.</p>



<p>Caria twisted her mouth, as she looked upset. She was clearly dismayed
because a dumb device tricked all of them. Besides, Lugis got separated with that
Sorceress woman named Filaret.</p>



<p>「Let’s determine the course of action. First, the situation is
quite bad. The party was divided and there is no prospect of merging again.
Second, our best option is to return to the city-state and ask for help.」</p>



<p>This man, Helot Stanley, stated the facts correctly. His judgment was
not clouded.</p>



<p>A trap had
divided the party. It would be dangerous if they were to fall for a second trap
without asking for help. The best way to avoid that possible outcome was to
escape from the underground temple and search for help. The situation was clear and the number of
missing people was certain. Therefore, asking for proper aid would be the best
solution for this problem.</p>



<p>Caria Burdnick squeezed her silver eyes. She thought carefully for a
brief moment. Soon, she decided what she wanted to do and declared the
following.</p>



<p>「No, I’m moving forward. There are no guarantees
that falling back will
fix this situation. If I want results, the best option is to continue.」</p>



<p>「Quite surprising, isn’t it? I actually agree
with you. The safest option to take would be to return and ask for help. That
would be the normal thing to do. But, time does not rewind. If we delay this,
then it’s less likely they’ll be rescued.」</p>



<p>Helot nodded in agreement, while Caria shook her silver hair away from
her forehead.</p>



<p>Both of them chose the unlikely measure. Even though their decision was
the result of a rational calculation, in the end, it was more inclined to be an
emotional decision.</p>



<p>They didn’t bring enough provisions to be able to last several days. Each member of the
party had at least enough food and water to last a day at best. From Garoua
Maria to the location of the underground temple would take a long day by
horse-carriage. Even if they rushed, it would take a minimum of two full days to
come back with help.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be a problem if the missing members rationed their food and
water. People won’t die that easily by starving for a day. If they saved enough
of their provisions, it would last them two full days.</p>



<p>However, if they fell into a trap, there was a high possibility that
everything went wrong. They could be hurt, have serious injuries, broken limbs,
or excessive bleeding. If that happened, they wouldn’t last even one day. If
that was the case, then we must go ahead. It was a worrisome situation.
Therefore, the best way to deal with this was to do things quickly.</p>



<p>「Besides, I’m sure that man was the first one to
step into that trap. Yeah, he’s that kind of human being.」</p>



<p>Caria spoke with a sarcastic tone while walking through the stone hallway.
The surroundings were dark. They lit the area with a torch, and they finally managed to see
something of this strange place. It was the remains of the underground temple.
However, it was only the outer structures. The main hall could be hidden beneath
all this structures. It was unusual to build a symbolic temple underground. It
was mysterious. If the heraldic people were persecuted, then that would explain
why they built the temple this way. The stone configuration was completely unfamiliar to Caria.</p>



<p>But, in spite of this daunting area, Caria remembered the figure of Lugis
involuntarily. She cleared her throat and laughed.</p>



<p>「…Even though we’re in the middle of a crisis, I
can see that Miss Caria isn’t easily persuaded by panic or fear. Are you, Miss
Caria, perhaps, of noble birth?」</p>



<p>Helot walked in front of Caria with a light when he heard her laugh.
When Caria asked why he thought that way, Helot responded with a soft voice.</p>



<p>He explained that her skin condition, the tone of the voice, and her way of speaking were
characteristics that could naturally differ between commoners and aristocratic
people. Common people didn’t have the need to use sophisticated words. If the
body was subjected to harsh physical labor, the skin would be burnt and
bruised. The common people’s lifestyle would be reflected on the body’s shape
and motion.</p>



<p>Helot continued to explain that he felt something different about Caria
since the beginning. She had a strange premonition when they first met in the Guild.</p>



<p>That’s right. Caria was gazing at her tiny white fingers. She realized
that her hands and skin were probably one of the reasons why he felt different
about her. Her hands held swords, but she never did agricultural work before.
She didn’t know how
to pick wheat as well. Neither how to grip the tools with her hands nor how to squeeze
the rag. Her hands showed that she never did hard labor. Yes, her hands would indeed be strange
for common folks. That’s why she was far from being one of them.</p>



<p>「Well, I have one more question. How is Miss Caria and Mister Lugis related?」</p>



<p>Strangely, he sounded as if he selected those words beforehand. However,
that question could be made of either sincerity, curiosity or innocence that existed in Helot’s heart.</p>



<p>「I don’t understand
what are you implying. Do you possible mean, why I was accompanied by a person
with a totally different upbringing?」</p>



<p>「Yes, that’s right. It’s unusual for people
of different backgrounds and classes to be traveling with each other.」</p>



<p>What he said was, of
course, a natural thing to say about Caria and Lugis. There was no way
that people would say that they belonged to same origin. Their characteristics
were too different from one
and another. The words and atmosphere surrounding Caria were of noble
origins. While Lugis behaved exactly like common people.</p>



<p>Caria stroke her chin. She was immersed on her thoughts after Helot
questioned her relationship with Lugis. For example, if their different origins
were correct, Caria would be the master and Lugis will be the servant. It was
an obvious order of relationship between classes. However, their interactions
in the Guild clouded that judgment towards their relationship as master and
servant. It became confusing. After all, even Caria didn’t fully understand
what kind of relationship she had with Lugis.</p>



<p>「About what you said. It’s a bit difficult to explain the relationship I have with him…」</p>



<p>「Yes, that’s why I felt it was strange. But, I could see that Miss Caria trusts Mister Lugis very much. Yes,
it’s a relationship based on trust. If you two were in love, then that would
explain everything.」</p>



<p>When those words
were professed, Caria’s mind became frozen. It was as if her brain was trying
to grasp the understanding of something unknown.</p>



<p>Love. When someone
had affection for another person, and when those feelings were reciprocated by that same person,
a relationship would be built on love. A link that united two
individuals. Caria and him. No, that wasn’t true. That thing didn’t exist. It’s
not been that long since they met each other. They had different backgrounds
and different ways of life. How could two very different people fall in love with each
other? Well, they didn’t.</p>



<p>No, wait. Caria
held her thoughts once more. She remembered that love was a feeling that made
the heart throb. If that was the case, then that means that her feelings for
him could be love?</p>



<p>However, while
repeating these two distinct thoughts on her mind, Caria finally reached to a
conclusion and answered.</p>



<p>「Comrade. Yes, he is my comrade. That’s how I describe our relationship.」</p>



<p>That’s it. Caria
remembered what Lugis said to her before. This description was more
appropriate. Of course, that didn’t erase the fact that it was odd that people
of different backgrounds were comrades. But, that explanation was fine for now.</p>



<p>Still, Helot had
some doubts but, even so, he accepted her reasoning. He continued the
conversation with Caria.</p>



<p>「This is a good opportunity, so I will tell you how I sincerely feel
about him…To be honest, that person didn’t leave a very good impression on me.
I even consider him dangerous.」</p>



<p>His tone was a bit
darker than normal. His topic
of conversation changed right from
the stage of a regular conversation to a serious one. When Caria heard his
words, she said it was absurd.</p>



<p>Caria thought that
Helot was overthinking too much about Lugis’ character. But, he spoke his
sincere thoughts to
a person like Caria. She didn’t understand love, or companionship. She was sometimes
unreasonable and sometimes rude. That’s why Helot wanted to know about the
relationship she had with Lugis. Upon analyzing her words, Helot decided to
tell her more about his impression of Lugis.</p>



<p>Heliot was sincere and serious with that line of
reasoning. Caria put her hand on her head in a way that
looked like she was puzzled by hearing the words of a seemingly sincere person.</p>



<p>「It’s true that I’m not familiar with him in a
way that you are. But, he is definitely not a good person. Miss Caria. Why are you with a person like him?」</p>



<p>I see. So, that was
the opinion Helot Stanley had of Lugis. Caria understood what he tried to say
with “not a good person”. She looked the other way and kept walking further ahead.</p>



<p>He was a person who
couldn’t leave what
was incorrect without saying it was incorrect. He wouldn’t let injustice
prevail. He would rather face evil with justice up front. He was a person who
was straight to the point. He
was that type of person.</p>



<p>「I’m extremely worried about Filaret at this precise moment. I’m so worried that I feel
like my chest is ripping apart. There’s no way that I can calm down in a situation like this.
So, I&#8217;d like to tell you this. If by any chance he does something bad to
Filaret…I’m going to make him my enemy.」</p>



<p>During this time,
he said what he was going to do. He was serious. Caria understood what it meant
without fussing about it.</p>



<p>Although it was too
sudden, he was ready to oppose a member of this newly formed party. It was just an assumption. But, it was
something he firmly believed in.
That’s why he felt it was unfair not to explain everything that he felt to Caria.
That’s what he thought. His sincere feelings.</p>



<p>Caria winked her silver eyes. She slowly pressed her lips, her words started to build up inside of her.</p>
