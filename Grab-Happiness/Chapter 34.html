<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; The Lead Filaret La Volgograd</h3>

<p>“That was a very foolish action…</p>



<p>What would happen if
a person gets surrounded by flames? Moreover, he was the one that triggered
the fuel. It was logical,
even children would understand what would happen this foolish scenario.
Naturally, that person would perish.</p>



<p>Of course, the
ultimate result would be his death. Yet, it wouldn’t be an instant death. The whole body
would burn, the internal organs would boil with heat, and he would be unable to
breathe. He would die with the worst possible pain. Yes, very foolish. Even
children would’ve known this. The men that held us captive were in distress. Even they knew that fire
could be that dangerous. Even so, why he did this…</p>



<p>…why did he do this much and risk his life?</p>



<p>I didn’t understand. I really didn’t understand the reason why. We
weren’t close. I, Filaret La Volgograd, never treated him as my friend. Neither
did him. I was a mediocre person. I had no power. So, it was unimaginable to
think that he did this foolish action just for my sake.”</p>



<p>Confusing thoughts swirled insanely through Filaret’s mind.</p>



<p>Filaret was considered mediocre within the Volgograd family.</p>



<p>The Volgograd family was a famous household of sorcerers. No member that
bore the family name was allowed to be an ordinary person. They were talented
geniuses that belonged to a distinguished bloodline. Their education was strict
but surrounded with privileges. They grew up in the best of all environments.
To be considered mediocre by their standards meant that a person lacked the
qualities of a sorcerer. A failure. A poor product. Wicked.</p>



<p>She wasn’t truly like that. Yet, she was regarded as mediocre. A wicked
and useless person. She never stood out on her own. She wasn’t able to get rid
of that nomenclature.</p>



<p>“Ah, since when. Since when it all started?” Filaret had no idea when
she started to realize that she had no talents. She had no early memories of
it. But, she remembered the feelings from that time. She felt despair and
frustration many times over her failed experiments.</p>



<p>She wouldn’t be able to live in the Volgograd household if she remained
mediocre. So, she managed to trick others to think that she had some sort of
problem or disease. She did that to hide her lack of talents. A sickness that
didn’t allow her to display her brilliant qualities.</p>



<p>Although she worked harder than anyone else did, all her efforts went to waste. They never bloomed, and she was
never rewarded for her efforts. It was insufficient even if she devoted
herself entirely to witchcraft. </p>



<p>A sorcerer was a person who knew the laws of harmony in nature. A
sorcerer was also a person who could rewrite the structures of this world by
enchanting philosophical techniques.</p>



<p>Therefore, her efforts were commendable. But, the results were small.
Filaret suffered from her own misery. She couldn’t do what the other sorcerers
were capable of doing. Her powers were shortsighted. She gave all of herself,
all of her efforts, for nothing. It didn’t amount for anything.</p>



<p>…Filaret thought the following. “The others in my family were like gold,
talented. Yet, I couldn’t be like gold. I was a lead (metal), and nothing more.
That’s why I worked harder than anyone else to become someone worthy.”</p>



<p>That’s why she sought difficult tasks. As a Volgograd, she would chant continuously
to try and earn the
title of a sorcery master.
</p>



<p>However, that was an
almost impossible magical task to accomplish. A conceptual idea that blew away any sort
of reason. There weren’t
any precedents&#8230; The world never saw an untalented person become a sorcery master.
It could be a path of delusion. Her childhood was engulfed by failures and
fear. It was a fact, not mere
conjecture.</p>



<p>Everyone outside of her family also called her an imposter, an oddity,
and a swindler. Filaret was ridiculed constantly. She felt “hatred” from a very young age.</p>



<p>That didn’t change
even after she enrolled in the prestigious institute in Garoua Maria. Even though
she enjoyed some privileges because of her parent’s house, she couldn’t
distance herself from the
prejudice of other people.</p>



<p>She was an outsider
and the failure of the Volgograd family. Many people avoided contact with
Filaret. It was only Helot
Stanley who remained close to her.</p>



<p>“…Ah, that man. So,
he was what people would call a gold person.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t all about
a strong presence. He had the ability to attract other people. He was skilled
and learnt everything brilliantly. Ah, such frustration. How much she wanted
that talent of his. How could she gain all of that?</p>



<p>Dazzling. Yes, his
existence was too dazzling. One could burn the eyes if they stared directly at him for too long.
However, that was a good reason to follow him. To stand by his side.</p>



<p>It was a gamble. To be with him was a
choice. But, it was a
choice that could provide an opportunity to shine, or maybe not. But, it was the only prospect
she had. What else
could she do if she wasn’t blessed with any skill whatsoever?</p>



<p>*slashing sound*</p>



<p>A neck was cut and
the robust soldier was beheaded on the spot. In front of the body, stood a man.
A different man. The adventurer called Lugis. He didn’t waver. The place where
they held us as prisoners was engulfed with flames. It was this man’s idea. An idea
that also exposed his body and his life. He went face to face with death.</p>



<p>It was strange. An
unbelievable occurrence. Filaret shook her dark hair and touched her eyes
repeatedly. She couldn’t believe
what was happening. But, everything was real. Lugis was about to be
exposed by the scorching fire.</p>



<p>“…He was supposed
to be just like me.”</p>



<p>The human being in
front of her should’ve been an ordinary person. He wasn’t a genius. There were
traces of anguish on his demeanor. A similar emotion that she felt on her skin
before. She thought the following. “He was like me”. Or so she thought.</p>



<p>Why did he risk so
much for this? He didn’t have
to work that hard. Giving up wasn’t that bad. Difficult tasks should be entrusted to
geniuses. Ordinary people just had to keep living with their heads held down.</p>



<p>Death. Ordinary
people could die by acting unreasonable. They mustn’t try too hard. Downfall
could be the price to pay when ordinary people chased after talent and recognition.</p>



<p>“Ah. Yes, I don’t
like it. I hate it. I absolutely hated it”.</p>



<p>She kept saying to
herself. “He wouldn’t have to do that if I was able to enchant my magic”. There
was definitely a better way than doing that risky move. Because, in the end, he
could die from his own actions.</p>



<p>“…I, Filaret La
Volgograd, couldn’t let that happen. It would be my responsibility if he died”.</p>



<p>She continued. “I
couldn’t consent this. Such results were unacceptable. The worst emotion that
my mind could feel was regret”.</p>



<p>Yes, he was
definitely an ordinary person. Probably what the world would describe as lead
or copper. Even so. How could the world describe such person when he tried to
risk his own life in order to save mine?</p>



<p>That man, Lugis,
was doing his best. And yet, this world tried to give him a pitiful ending.</p>



<p>“Don’t joke with me. This was outrageous. I was like that man. Yes, an
ordinary person like him but one that wanted to live even if he wasn’t like
gold. To fight against the prejudice of this rotten world”.</p>



<p>“…I shall make us
like gold myself. Even if we had to rewrite the ways of this world”.</p>



<p>Filaret’s spirit twisted back. The anger against the people and the
world they lived in was manifested through her determination. It was enough.
Yes, enough of being beaten, trampled and abandoned.</p>



<p>So, no more of
this. Filaret’s throat emitted a sound. The surroundings were burning with fire
and some of the guards tried to extinguish that fire by using buckets with water. But,
her life was not safe as long as she remained inside the blazing room.</p>



<p>However, Filaret
didn’t move an inch. She had little desire to run away. She thought. “I won’t
lose someone’s life because of my incompetence. Rather than saving my own skin,
I would rather try to save the one who risked his life for mine. There was no
way that I’ll let a human die in front of my eyes. I absolutely won’t”.</p>



<p>Her body was overheated and
the throat was dry. She wished
for something more, a power within her. To use everything that she got even if
it was just a
little talent. This was the moment. The only way to escape from this hell. To
escape from the flames, and from the hatred of this world. In Filaret’s eyes,
Lugis still held the sword surrounded by fire. The field of vision gradually
disappeared. Everything was filled with distortion, except the one that truly
mattered. The walls, the floor, the other soldiers, even the flames were
distorted on her eyesight. Only Lugis was visible.</p>



<p>“…Hopefully, a
windstorm will extinguish the fire that burns his body”.</p>



<p>It was a ritual of magic, and not a mere
enchantment. It was called the Sorcerer’s Breath. That magic was invoked with
deep feelings. The ultimate desire to rewrite the ways of the cruel world.</p>



<p>Filaret ordered the
entire body of Lugis to be covered by a windstorm and attack the fire burning
his entire body. The magic was so powerful that it could attack Lugis as well.
But, it was the only way to keep the fire away from him, and to alleviate the
scorching flames inside the room. Under normal circumstances, the flames combined
with the windstorm would rip the body apart. Blood would be splashed mercilessly,
without leaving any traces of a living being. The power of the infinitesimal
windstorm.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, there
was no way that she’ll allow that. Filaret
wouldn’t dare to hurt Lugis. She promised not to. She made an oath with him
before coming to the underground temple.</p>



<p>“…I swore that my
magic would never hurt Lugis, ever”.</p>



<p>Her breathing was hard, and her heartbeat couldn’t even
be heard on the midst of that pressure. The flow of magic didn’t stop.
The eyes didn’t blink, but the hands shook tremendously. Filaret didn’t know if
she was sane or crazy anymore.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, she
did her best not to be distracted with external factors. Her eyes were
extremely focused on that person. She never blinked or diverted her eyes. She vowed to herself
not to be defeated, but to prevail until the very end.</p>



<p>Her magical powers
continued fervently. She went to the boundaries of her limit in order to
succeed. Then her magical
power stopped and everything became clearer, Lugis lost his
consciousness and fell down.</p>
