<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Her Request and His Condition</h3>


<p>「You brought me to a place that resembles the
beauty of the blue
sky. 」</p>



<p>Those poetic words didn’t fit Caria’s personality. <em>(EN: unfortunately
the poetry of her words gets lost in translation, it’s very hard to translate
traditional Japanese poetry to English, and convey the same meaning, sorry if
sometimes a phrase seems weird…)</em></p>



<p>I guess she was in a very good mood. She made a pleasant expression
while she drank some ale. Her lips were wet from the ale. The Garganti Chamber of the Commerce Guild had an
impressive tavern on the outbuilding. The tavern had a vast space. Unlike the
shady taverns I’ve been before, this place didn’t reek of alcohol and vomit. I
didn’t even see a
piece of trash on the floor. It was a clean place. People from the Guild gathered
here to drink some ale pleasantly while they gained some good energy for their
next job. It was a very prestigious Guild tavern.</p>



<p>Unlike the tavern I used to go, the flavor of the alcohol was of a higher quality
but it didn’t taste that good. They probably served this type of drinks to people
of considerable prestige backgrounds.
No wonder that the tongue of the Knight class was used to luxurious pleasures
unlike ordinary folks, who drank strong and authentic alcohol.</p>



<p>「And yet, this place is lacking on many areas.
It looks too neat and clean. It’s not thrilling at all. Maybe the request will be
something similar. Something uninteresting. I don’t know why we even came here.
There’s nothing to do around here. It’s your fault. It would be great if I
could kill some colossal
beast at least.」</p>



<p>Caria only spoke about thrill and beasts. What she truly wanted was to
defeat some monster in a single combat. But, she kept complaining to me. She
sighed constantly and moved her shoulders as if she was mocking me. She made me
feel like a fool who didn’t know what to do.</p>



<p>Then, Caria’s gaze was directed towards Largud Ann.</p>



<p>「What do you think, Ann. Did you think the arrangement
for this meeting was neutral from both parties involved?」</p>



<p>Largud Ann sat on large barrel instead of a chair. She drank from a cup
but stop moving her lips when she heard that question. </p>



<p>「I wonder… We’re talking about people with unwavering values and high
sense of commitment. They must be people who keep their words. They should be
but… 」</p>



<p>At first, it seemed like we had nothing to worry about. Yet, to be
honest, I thought otherwise. Even if Largud Ann’s words were reassuring,
Caria’s remarks made it completely different. She looked at me with the corners
of her eyes. It was as if I could
feel thorns piercing my skin. I felt uncomfortable. That was to be
expected though. I had a bad habit of reacting according to my feelings. Caria
seemed to understand how I felt. So, she looked the other way with a very
triumphant look.</p>



<p>I see. It was definitely a bad. Yes, a very bad move from my part. No
wonder she had a suspicious impression. I did act on impulse because of Filaret
la Volgograd’s insulting remarks. However, even if my actions were driven by an
urge of hate, I did think
that it was the best approach to take on that moment.</p>



<p>「…But I wonder about that girl. The one called
Filaret la Volgograd. I’m sure that man will keep his word, but she is a
different story. I don’t think she is a person that can be persuaded that
easily, much less businesses that involve money or other riches. 」</p>



<p>I knew it. Largud Ann was actually a person who could read the situation
effectively.</p>



<p>She had just met
Filaret la Volgograd and, yet, she was able to assess the depths of her
character. She seemed to
have a good ability to evaluate other people thoughts.</p>



<p>In fact, Largud Ann was able to see if people had capable abilities or not. Ms. Ninz
left me a letter. It introduced the name of our guide and explained that she
had great persuasive and negotiating skills. It was probably due to her ability
to judge other people’s characters. To be honest, she was quite straightforward
with us. She told Caria and I about this Guild and that we had to make a
registration inside. So, she possessed interpersonal
skills. It seemed that this
person introduced
by Ms. Ninz was not just a mere name after all.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, I felt terrible whenever I thought about those two and how
I met them again. My mind was narrow and my heart felt heavy for hiding a bad
feeling for this long.</p>



<p>「They’ll come. That’s my opinion. 」</p>



<p>Caria spoke after she heard Largud Ann’s skeptical words. Despite the
bad taste, I poured some ale onto my stomach.</p>



<p>「I really wonder if they’ll come. You also have
good eyes when it comes to evaluating
other people, but it’s different when it comes to a woman’s heart.」</p>



<p>Largud Ann looked at Caria with pale eyes.</p>



<p>To tell the truth, for me, Largud Ann looked more of a woman than Caria.
Largud Ann had a petite frame, while Caria was a bit of a tomboy. Largud Ann
probably didn’t see Caria as a sensitive woman. Honestly, I never thought that
anyone would be brave enough to imply directly to Caria that she was, in fact,
oblivious about a woman’s heart.</p>



<p>「I saw her once. Just as you said, she isn’t a
person that can be persuaded that easily. However, I also think that she won’t
miss the opportunity to attend this meeting. Besides, what does she has to
lose? I’m sure she’s curious&#8230;Wanna bet that she’ll come? 」</p>



<p>I was impressed to hear the conversation between the tiny frail woman
that sat on the barrel and the tomboy who drank ale. This talk was becoming a battle of the
feminine side ever since a woman’s heart was mentioned.</p>



<p>They bet on a bottle of wine. On that moment, Caria’s eyes changed
dramatically.</p>



<p>The gaze of her silver eyes burnt like vivid flames. Besides that, her
body was too straight and stiff as if her spine was frozen. I didn’t know how
this was going to be like, but I was certain of something. Both of them didn’t
have the intention of losing this bet.</p>



<p>My stomach hurt like it had been twisted. I had an ominous feeling about this. I mean, I
stood in between the both of them. There was no way I could feel comfortable on
this position. Surely nothing
good will come out of this.</p>



<p>*bell sound*</p>



<p>The doors’ bells rang whenever
someone entered the tavern. The people in the tavern didn’t care about the new
guests as they kept drinking and talking. But, not us. One of us was perplexed,
while the other was pleased.</p>



<p>Caria grabbed the prized bottle of wine and drank it vigorously. She
won.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>「We’re here to talk about our request and your
condition. 」</p>



<p>Filaret la Volgograd’s clear voice echoed through the tavern. Her voice
was very different from Caria’s. A voice that strangely remained in our ears.</p>



<p>My party consisted of three people. Caria, Largud Ann and me. The other
party consisted of Filaret and the future hero Helot Stanley. Five people
surrounded a wood
table.</p>



<p>I tried to keep my mind calm. I made an extra effort to control my
heartbeats. Then, she opened her lips and began to talk.</p>



<p>「First. The request involves the old
religion. This religions specialized in heraldry.* You’ll have to escort me
to the infamous temple ruins, and you must provide cooperation and aid for the
expedition.」</p>



<p>Heraldry. The old religion was often depicted in the designs of the
religious temples. At least, that was what I heard before. But, it was from a
long time ago. The current faith doesn’t allow images or designs in churches. They call it
heresy. So, I didn’t know that there were some people interested in studying
the old sculptures and carvings.</p>



<p>The temples from the heraldic order were mostly destroyed or lost. People
often said that some believers survived the change of times and continued to offer their faith
to the old religion. But, large-scale temples did no longer exist. Most
perished when the new faith became mainstream.</p>



<p>When the location
of the temple was appealing, the new faith would use the structures to
rebuild a church. If the location were undesirable, then they would be
destroyed. But, if the location was ominous, it would be left intact and
abandoned, becoming the habitat of wild animals and evil spirits. It seemed
that this request corresponded to the latter, an abandoned temple in ruins.</p>



<p>「Second. If you find something peculiar, you
should bring it with you and submit to us. You mustn’t forget this. Of course,
we shall reward you with these&#8230;
」</p>



<p>A big sack with coins was placed on the table.</p>



<p>It was strange to see a full sack of coins as our payment. Well, there
was nothing wrong with the payment itself. But, it was quite unusual for
Filaret to give us this considerable amount of money. She was always the person who was
meticulous with her finances. She would hoard everything valuable she could
find. That’s why her action seemed dubious to me.</p>



<p>Of course, I didn’t know her on this timeline, so I won’t abandon the
possibility that she wasn’t always crazy about hoarding riches.</p>



<p>「Okay, this is the request. Now, let’s hear your
condition. 」</p>



<p>Filaret’s mouth closed and her eyes looked attentively at us. She seemed
to be a person that was aware of her intentions, even in the past. Her facial
expression showed some curiosity.</p>



<p>I pointed one finger to them while I opened my mouth to speak.</p>



<p>「First of all, I would like to receive a payment
in advance separately from the reward. In order to achieve this request, don’t
you think that preparation
is essential? 」</p>



<p>When I spoke my first condition, I could see that Filaret clench her
teeth.</p>



<p>Next to her, Helot Stanley narrowed his eyes when he heard the
condition.</p>



<p>In fact, I really needed the pre-payment money. One of my rusty knives remained broken
and I didn’t have much money to afford to stay a night at an inn. In order to start this
new life, it was necessary to have some solid money first.</p>



<p>「And, the second one… 」</p>



<p>I showed them my finger for the second time. Filaret’s expression showed
a crimson mixed color on her face. She clearly heard my words before, but it
seemed that she didn’t have
fully digested the contents of my previous condition.</p>



<p>She was becoming gradually impatient. Then, I slowly turned my gaze
directly towards her.</p>



<p>「Filaret la Volgograd, you’re a Sorceress,
right? If I’m correct, then, you shall take an oath…You must swear to me that
you’ll never do anything to harm me. 」</p>



<p>Their throats swallowed dry and their eyebrows wrinkled profusely.
Besides clenching her teeth, the Sorceress began to bite her own lips. Her jaw
was pressed heavily. On that moment…</p>



<p>「…Please wait a minute. I understood the purpose
of your first condition for our request. But, I don’t think that your second
condition is reasonable.
What you’re asking is too far-fetched. Who thinks to ask for an oath as a
condition? This is absurd. 」</p>



<p>The perplexed words of Helot Stanley echoed everywhere.</p>



<p>Yeah, I knew it too well. I was aware that he would bite my bait. My
plan was successful for now.</p>



<p>I could see that
his gaze showed a bit of hostility towards us. Ah, this feeling was
comforting. It was the first time that I understood how it felt to have someone show this type
of hostility towards me. It was always the reverse in my past life, I was always the
one to suffer and have hostile
feelings towards him. Ah, this reversal was a very pleasant thing.</p>
