<h3>Chapter 38 &#8211; The Secret Meeting of a Villain</h3>

<p>「How much do you know about the Saint, my
heroes? 」</p>



<p>Largud Ann asked if we knew her name. It was a fact that woman introduced herself to us… But, we didn’t know
anything else about her. Ann shook strangely her neck and sighed deeply.</p>



<p>That gesture. Our guide behaved exactly like a child. It was hard to
believe that this child had such
an eloquent speech that not even the “heavenly people” could match her skill. Still, it was thanks to
these conversational skills that made her shine among other merchants and dealers.</p>



<p>「The Saint woman…Lady Matia is not someone for
you to underestimate. She hides her double-faced devil character beneath her
serene persona.」</p>



<p>Largud Ann made a bold statement when she described the Saint woman. She
compared that sacred woman to a devil. That was not a very good compliment.
Rather, Ann warned us about that woman’s real personality.</p>



<p>「She saved my life once. That’s why she
nominated me as a liaison this time. I guess it was unavoidable. However, we must expect that some
sort of interest will come along with the contents of this negotiation.」</p>



<p>I would rather say that that Saint woman had a different perspective when examining things…
I could say that she didn’t look at things with a mere curiosity or
interest. She probably had ulterior motives, and wanted to know about what type of people we were
and what kind of objectives we had. However, that cunning woman spoke in a
serene manner back then. She most likely didn’t want anyone to be suspicious of
her true colors.</p>



<p>「I don’t have a clue on what these negotiations will
bring for us. But, I do know about two things so far.」</p>



<p>I spoke while I chew my chewing tobacco that I bought back in the town
center. I showed her my two fingers. I folded one of them and continued to
speak.</p>



<p>「First. That Saint woman is mimicking the Beloved
Maria. 」</p>



<p>The Beloved Maria. A famous person which inspired people to user her name to name the strong
iron wall that forbids the free transit. After all, Garoua Maria became a
fortified city thanks to the pride of its name. It was a place blessed by
safety and glory.</p>



<p>However, it was strange. Why would a Saint woman mimicking the Beloved
Maria settle down on a temple in ruins? Why not in the holy and fortified city-state? Besides,
why did the
heraldic order do its
best to go up against the rules of that city?</p>



<p>Of course, an important place for trade would be an obvious answer. If
someone controlled that place, it would have a great influence on the surroundings. Certainly. In
addition, the heraldic order could gain influence if they controlled the
economic influx. Moreover, it
would become extremely advantageous if they gained access to the political
jurisdiction of the city because they would control who left and who arrived.</p>



<p>But, that wasn’t the reason. For them, small things such as strategical
advantages were invisible in
their eyes.</p>



<p>It wasn’t trade that mattered to them. Their ambition to recapture
Garoua Maria was because of their desire to retake the Holy Land. Garoua Maria
was a sacred place of worship and wisdom for the heraldic people. This city was
once their main path of knowledge because all the wisdom from the East and the
West gathered in one place.</p>



<p>Recapturing this city-state must be a top priority. In order to make
this happen, the Saint woman had to claim her authenticity and gather the
remaining people of the heraldic order to participate in such calculating act.
That’s why Saint Woman
posed herself as a fake Maria.</p>



<p>My chewing tobacco was in
my mouth for a very long time. Before long, the strong aroma passed through my
nose and I exhaled
to the air. It was a good feeling. Everything felt tense to me except this. A
very good and rewarding relaxation. I continued to speak while I held the other
finger.</p>



<p>「Second. It’s about
you, Largud Ann. I just spit some rubbish words on the spur of the moment back
then. But, it seemed that everything changed when I mentioned you. It’s likely
that you’re in the favor of that Saint woman.」</p>



<p>She raised the corner of her mouth and took a deep breath.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, when I gave that piece of information to the Saint
woman, I realized that it felt different. Her killing eyes changed color and
her demeanor altered. It was obvious. Even Caria and Helot Stanley, which were
with me during that time, noticed that difference. It was a perfect moment to
create a collaboration. Though I must confess that my companions weren’t that willing to cooperate
with the people who had
tried to murder us.</p>



<p>After all, if I remembered correctly, Helot Stanley was definitely a
Christian. Well, even if the depths of his faith were not at the degree of
obsession as the
heraldic people, he was still bound by the rules of his faith. Yes, there was
no mistake about it.</p>



<p>Everything was clear to me. No doubt. Ah, the party I used to be part of
in the future. All of us in that group went on a journey of salvation as the
saviors of the Great Christianity.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>The poor people’s odor. A very nostalgic smell. Yet, it was a smell of vomit,
a rotten odor of an unwashed person, and a smell of dirty streets. A very
intense smell that increased gradually over the day. It was as if it were
boiling in a pot. Ah, the nostalgic smell of my hometown. A smell of the dark
corners where I once lived.
The dirty and shoddy alleys. It really reminded me of home. There was no
liveliness in the surroundings. Everyone kept walking without looking at the
sky.</p>



<p>These people only had today’s day. There was no such thing as tomorrow.
Looking forward to tomorrow was a luxury of the lucky men that whose lives were
guaranteed. Still, poor people were not allowed to have such blessings. They
could never dream of better days. This was a harsh way of life for weaklings
like them. No better prospects for tomorrow. These poor people could only
afford to give their best to live day by day, and keep doing their very best to survive
until the end of the day, and
then repeat the process until they got old. That’s all they’ve got.</p>



<p>「So, why don’t you relax a little bit to walk
with ease? 」</p>



<p>Yes, Largud Ann asked me to relax. But, I was wary in this sort of
place. This rotten area was like a maze. We walked through similar places over
and over again. And outsider would get lost immediately. In fact, the terrain
itself became unreadable. It was the “poor people’s dark cave” after all. A
dimly lit place where every corner was the same.</p>



<p>Largud Ann had a bitter smile on her face upon looking at my anxious
expression.</p>



<p>「Yeah, sure. I know that it’s difficult to get
used to this sort of place. However, I had no choice but to come here because
of the meeting place.」</p>



<p>The upcoming negotiations with the enemy’s party. Well, I was sure that
the heraldic people were involved in a bigger scheme than just a mere
negotiation. No wonder that Largud Ann was somewhat bitter with me. After all,
if it weren’t for that Saint woman, I wouldn’t have needed to expose Largud Ann like
this.</p>



<p>Yes, I had another purpose beneath this entire plan. I was doing a
surveillance job as well. I was watching over Largud Ann. She was the one that
brought Caria and me to Garoua Maria. She provided accommodation for us, and
she negotiated with the local Guild to help us find our next path in life.
There was no way that I’ll lose someone like Largud Ann. Her precious help
could be of use in the future as well. So, I shouldn’t just ignore that Saint
woman’s story. I had to cooperate with Largud Ann so that nothing would happen
to her. She was our lifeline.</p>



<p>It was absolutely imperative to create a business relationship. A state
of cooperation in order not to create a bad connection. Anyways, the biggest
mystery to me was why on earth did “they” buy so many tools?</p>



<p>Ah, I must be silly indeed. I shook my neck lightly to realize the
seriousness of the situation. Caria, Filaret and Helot Stanley were with me
during that abduction. They knew those insane people. No wonder that they
bought so many tools in case something went wrong. It was just for precaution.
If that was the case, then it made sense in a way.</p>



<p>In addition, those heraldic runaways must have some grudge against me. After all, I was the
one who destroyed part of their accumulated knowledge. I burned everything down. They valued
their wisdom above all. From their point of view, it would be tempting to
crucify the instigator. To kill me.</p>



<p>Actually, it was worse than that. Saint Matia was a greedy woman with
deep hatred towards everyone on this world. I wouldn’t be the only one to
suffer the consequences. Caria and Filaret La Volgograd would meet their demise
as well.</p>



<p>Yes, even Filaret.</p>



<p>「…I must say that the person tracking us down
could’ve done a better job. 」</p>



<p>She showed me her hand and pointed discretely to our backside. There was
a shadowy figure following us from behind our backs. Ah, Largud Ann was
extremely sharp.</p>



<p>「I didn’t say much about it before because I
wasn’t sure. But, do you want me to find out who is pursuing us?」</p>



<p>After she spoke those words, she stopped walking ahead. She took her bag
and made me a signal. I tried to peek at our backs to see who was following us.</p>



<p>*metallic sound*</p>



<p>Something felt abruptly on the floor from Largud Ann’s bag. It was as if
iron clashed strongly on a marble floor. A high roar echoed around us. On this
instant, a voice of a woman screamed at the distance.</p>



<p>So, there was really
someone tailing us. At least, Largud Ann’s plan to find out if there was
someone following us or not was
successfully. She managed to scare our pursuer.</p>



<p>We waited on that spot for a while. But, no one came out. Then,
something crossed my mind
and I realized the familiarity of our pursuer’s voice.</p>



<p>I wasn’t entirely sure though. I put my hand on my cheeks to think about
what to do and, before long, I thought of calling this person’s name.</p>



<p>「Ah…Are you practicing some kind of a comedy
act? Filaret La Volgograd, my employer. 」</p>



<p>The sound of an old wood board cracked badly. Largud Ann noticed our
pursuers’ presence and stared suspiciously on the direction of the sound. I
didn’t tell my companions about the exact place of my location. If one of them
followed us of their own volition, then I was not to blame.</p>



<p>We saw a moving shadow at a corner of the “poor people’s cave”. That
mysterious person came out from there and I saw immediately some familiar
traits. A Sorceress with a long and shiny black hair. A very deep but troubled
gaze. It was that person. It was Filaret La Volgograd.</p>



<p>「…What. 」</p>



<p>I had a hunch that it was Filaret based on her voice. But, I didn’t
expect to see her for real. This was unexpected.</p>



<p>「I just saw you coming this way. But, I didn’t
chase you. 」</p>



<p>Filaret professed some hastily words. It looked as if she was giving us
some excuse. Her eyes didn’t even meet ours while she spoke. Her behavior was extremely
suspicious.</p>



<p>Her movements were strange. Without a doubt. I had no idea what was
going on. Why did she follow me in the first place?</p>



<p>I couldn’t help it but sigh at this awkward situation. Largud Ann stared
at me with a confusing expression on her face.</p>



<p>It seemed that “bad spirits” kept following me everywhere I went on this timeline.
They kept tracking me down to slow down my path, either be in a form of a
perilous situation or a person. “They” just wouldn’t let me go. I would call this
“bad luck”.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>After wandering around through the dark streets of the “poor people’s
cave”, we finally arrived at a bizarre-looking inn. It looked like a brothel.</p>



<p>We went
inside and went to the designated room. It was a simple room with a bed and a
round chair. The room was too small and narrow. It was extremely hot because we
were four people inside. In addition, it had a large barrel on the corner. I
became worried and curious
whenever I stared at that barrel.</p>



<p>I wondered why they chose this place. Too narrow and too stifling. Maybe
they wanted this room to be the meeting place because of their cautiousness.
Even so, their prudence was quite troublesome.</p>



<p>「I know this isn’t an ideal place to meet. But,
the inhabitants of this place are very lethargic. So, we have nothing to worry
about.」</p>



<p>Largud Ann shook her hand with this unknown man. He introduced to us as
a fellow collaborator. He bowed his head as a greeting and sat on the chair.
His large face and robust shoulders were so overwhelming that it looked like he
“crushed” his lower body because of that heavy burden.</p>



<p>「What kind of reply should I get if I do the
arrangement of food and money supplies? 」</p>



<p>Largud Ann stroke her chin with her tiny fingers. She wrinkled her
eyebrows while she was immersed on her thoughts. It was rather unusual to see
her with a troubled expression. She always met us with a cheerful persona.</p>



<p>I blank my eyes involuntarily after I observed the surroundings. It was
not a mere coincidence that we met on this obscure place. This place was quite
hidden in a shadowy alley. Inside was really dark, and the rooms were narrow.
It was hard to see who came in and who came out. Maybe that was the reason why
Largud Ann knew that the Heraldic order built their outside base on a
poverty-stricken area.</p>



<p>「There are unique
rules and practices among the poor. There are no limits when it comes to offers and rewards. I’ll
take everything I’ll receive. So, Ann. Is the one we’ve talked about among
these two?」</p>



<p>The man of the heavy-looking face turned his gaze to Filaret and me.</p>



<p>Filaret thought this was a ring dealer’s house at first. When she
realized that this place was a brothel, she shook her shoulders and touched her
hair nervously. We could hear several voices of women coming from the thin
walls. They came and faded away several times. It was awkward but their loud
voices camouflaged our conversation in the narrowly room. That’s why they chose
this exact room for secret meetings. It was pretty convenient to be honest.</p>



<p>「Yes. This is my hero, Lugis. And Lugis’ friend,
Filaret. 」</p>



<p>Largud Ann introduced us. Soon after, Filaret looked extremely
uncomfortable and opened her lips.</p>



<p>「Excuse me. What kind of meeting is this? A secret
meeting in a poverty-stricken area feels wrong. This feels like a villain’s lair.
This doesn’t feel right.」</p>



<p>The man rounded his eyes and then he stared closely at Largud Ann.
Afterwards, Largud Ann’s eyes stared at me on that sequence. Her questionable
gaze told me all. Why did I brought Filaret with me in the end? That was what
Largud Ann’s expression was saying to me.</p>



<p>Of course, she was right. But, I had no choice but to bring Filaret with
me after I found out that she followed me. Perhaps, it wasn’t a good choice.
But, it was a great opportunity. If I do everything well, I’ll be able to draw
Filaret to my side and pull her away from Helot Stanley. I’ll try any measures
to accomplish that even if I fail at first. After all, I was an adventurer that was used to
dark and depressive minds.</p>



<p>Besides, I thought that I had a chance of winning this. Why? Because of
what happened in the underground temple. The winning rate might be at half away
through by now. I mustn’t stall.
Every minute counts. Even five minutes of charming her would make a huge
difference. I would be far superior than my fateful enemy.</p>



<p>I opened my lips and spoke aloud to the “six eyes” that were in the
room.</p>



<p>「A haunted secret meeting, a “poor people’s
caves” and a gathering of people who can’t disclose the meaning of their
negotiations…Yes, this place doesn’t give any good vibe indeed, my employer.」</p>



<p>Filaret’s eyebrows wrinkled on this moment. She bit her lips, and her
body shivered in fear. She was surely frightened by this situation. Her throat
was dry as she tried her hardest to gulp.</p>



<p>「It’s just as you say…A secret meeting of a
villain…Why did you come here instead of staying in your beloved Garoua Maria?」</p>



<p>In the darkness, the words of that man resonated in our earlobes. A
mixed tension surrounded the three different parties at the narrowly room.</p>



<p>Largud Ann and that
mysterious man stared at Filaret with wide opened eyes. They were watching every move.
She wouldn’t be able to escape from here no matter what. There wasn’t anything
she could now.</p>



<p>Everyone was tense.
A long moment of silence consumed the whole room. Filaret’s beautiful dark eyes
were widely open, and they reflected my appearance as if they were a mirror.</p>
