<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Two People in the Underground Temple</h3>

<p>Caria and Helot Stanley’s voices started to fade away while we went further underground. It
looked like we changed positions, and we got separated from them. I came closer
to the sideline to have a better look at the surroundings.</p>



<p>「I feel
that this place could have some sort of traps. 」</p>



<p>「…For
some reason, I’m feeling nauseous. I’m not exaggerating. I wonder how
adventurers handle these extensive
explorations.」</p>



<p>After professing those words, Filaret la Volgograd looked at me while I
put some chewing tobacco on my mouth. I could only hear the chewing sound
coming from my mouth. Strangely, the volume of their voices gradually faded
away. Only silence remained.</p>



<p>We went to the underground temple and we got separated from the others. Filaret was feeling
bad, but she kept her cool and continued to walk using her instincts.</p>



<p>It was not nausea. It was nerves and tiredness. That’s why I brought
some chewing tobacco with me. I could feel the burnt smell through my nose. It
felt refreshing and my mind was clear. It reminded me of my younger days. I was
always nervous because of the dangers of my previous quests. I was always alone when I scouted.
I regarded myself as a scared
crow waiting for danger to strike me from my back.</p>



<p>「Wha…What should we do? Should we wait here for help? Or should we move on?」</p>



<p>I rounded my eyes as I thought about her words. I was about to swallow
the saliva I accumulated from chewing my tobacco. But, I felt uncomfortable because the
black-haired Sorceress was staring at me with anxious eyes.</p>



<p>Well, I had to say that I found this rather surprising.</p>



<p>Who knew that Filaret la Volgograd would ask for my opinion? In this timeline I was an
existence to her after all. Of course, she was different now from her future
self. She regarded me differently at this present timeline. Yet, I felt something overlapping
here. I could not tell what it was. It was surprising to see her cheeks
tightening in this unexpected
situation.</p>



<p>I got a wooden stick and I filled it with fatness from a demon beast. I lit up a fire using the
lighter from my chewing tobacco.</p>



<p>「Okay,
let’s move on. Don’t fall behind, miss employer. I’m used to this. So, let’s go
before the fire goes out.」</p>



<p>「But, it’s really dark in front of us. I wonder if adventurers can really see in this darkness.」</p>



<p>Like I said, I was used to it. Still, I gave my hand behind my shoulders
in order to avoid her being lost in this darkness. Ah yes, I was really used to
this type of surroundings. Although,
this was just my second experience in the dark, after coming to this
timeline.</p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p>The underground temple was built of old stones and clay. It was far from
being a delicate space. I could feel a harsh atmosphere from this place.</p>



<p>There were no valuable
things down here. And it didn’t look like a place that was used for worshipping.
But, still, it was the Sorceress idea. There should be a significant reason
that made Filaret want to come here… That was why she hired me in the first place. She had no
choice but to hire someone capable on wandering through the dark depths of the temple.</p>



<p>These abandoned places and ruins became the habitat of wild animals and
evil spirits. This location belonged to the city-state Guild’s jurisdiction.
Rather than leaving locations like this restricted, the Guild organized from
time to time, expeditions for adventurers. Sometimes, it didn’t involve just
explorations requested by the Guild. The state-city would, occasionally, order
some excavations as well. Therefore, the Guild wasn’t the only place to commission people to
do these types of works. The city-state administration would also be paid accordingly to
each request completed. It meant that each of them would receive some profit as
well. Money wouldn’t go
in the pockets of
the poor no matter where we went.</p>



<p>In other words, it was not acceptable to enter freely into the Guild management
facilities. Whether we brought something back from the expedition or did some
sort of excavation work. It would only be acknowledged if the Guild gave
permission directly or if the request was made officially by a third party.
Otherwise, Filaret wouldn’t be able to hire me if we didn’t follow these rules.</p>



<p>Ah, of course, I should’ve known why everything was messy. It was
because of the former apprentice Knight. First, she behaved rashly when we were inside the
Guild and, second, she ventured inside this temple without proper evaluation.
What an idiotic person. It seemed that her brain was only made of rocks.</p>



<p>I held the torch
and I moved forward. I could hear Filaret’s footsteps from behind my back. It
was interesting to hear the echoing sound of stepping on cobblestone.</p>



<p>I stopped walking and I looked back to have a glance of all the
surroundings. My eyes were strongly assessing this place. I opened my mouth to
profess some words. Yes, we should be fine.</p>



<p>「You
know, the demon beasts…I thought that something would crawl out from this
darkness. This place is safer than I thought it would be.」</p>



<p>「Hey,
hey, we should not let our guard down. This place is the perfect location of
nesting monsters. Some people have crazy fighting instincts, but I’m not like
that. I’m afraid of death. Let’s hope any of those monsters won’t attack us
from inside these traps.」</p>



<p>We put our hand in one wall and it opened naturally. We managed to avoid stepping in
a similar trap like the one before.</p>



<p>Yes, the first trap
was triggered when Filaret was separated from Helot Stanley.</p>



<p>「However,
it seems that you’re enjoying the thrill of this place. The ruins of the temple
from the old religion is not something we should explore with half-hearted
feelings.」</p>



<p>Anyways, we all came here as a party. Since Helot Stanley decided to
come with us, it would’ve been obvious for him to remain by Filaret’s side by
all means. For a man who had an awful sense of justice and commendable
companionship, his words became meaningless in a place that resembled a child’s
play.</p>



<p>It was not as if I schemed for this to happen on this specific moment.
If I had to choose, I would rather not speak to this particular woman.</p>



<p>However, in the future, Filaret only viewed Helot Stanley has the only existence in the world besides
her. That’s why their link had to be broken no matter what. Just by imagining
their interactions, my heart would drop as if it were a hard stone. The struggle I had during my
days with the rescue party and the hate I always had for Helot Stanley. I felt a sense of fear wondering
if this world would follow the same path as the world before. I might end up
with same results once again.</p>



<p>All sort of emotions were driving me crazy. I could feel excruciating
pain from my insides.</p>



<p>Therefore, I must become the one beside her, not him. That’s why I had
to seek something
in order to separate them for good.</p>



<p>「…You’re noisy. We have a situation here. There’s no time to talk about feelings.」</p>



<p>「How can
you speak like that to a Sorceress. 」</p>



<p>Well, that’s it. I should become Filaret’s acquaintance. First, I had to
break the awkwardness between us.</p>



<p>Of course. To be honest though, it looked like she had visited this place before. I
wondered if something went wrong during the previous time she came here. Maybe
she found this place from taking a detour on a particular journey.</p>



<p>However, I wasn’t sure if I would call her a woman during this timeline.
She took off her hood to observe the surroundings of this place. Based on her
looks, I could say that she was still a girl.</p>



<p>Perhaps, she failed to issue a request in the past. She couldn’t have come here without
the formalities of the Guild. She was probably forced to give up. That’s why
she became obsessed to explore this area. If that was the case, then I thank
her for bringing me here with her. That way, I could get more familiar with her.
Of course, she didn’t know about that.</p>



<p>「Listen,
you should be fine. Why are you afraid of death? You are a Sorceress. You can
perform all sorts of magic.」</p>



<p>The times I spent with the rescue party came to my mind. I remember that
the future Filaret la Volgograd was a fearless and confident Sorceress. She
wasn’t afraid of anything because she believed that she could do everything
with her magic skills. In regards to sorcery, I didn’t think that anyone would
be able to beat her.</p>



<p>「Don‘t
speak like you know me. 」</p>



<p>Suddenly, I heard strangely distorted words. I opened my eyes widely and
looked behind my back. She continued to speak.</p>



<p>「Listen,
you don’t know anything about me. At all. Do you get it? Thanks for reminding
me of my unworthiness! You are the one that isn’t thinking properly. You are
the person without knowledge here…Well, forget it. It doesn’t matter.」</p>



<p>Her words were firm, yet brutal. On that moment, I could see faint tears
on the corner of her black eyes. She was always a calm and well-disposed
person. And yet, she portrayed a seemingly impatient attitude with me. It was
strange to see her behaving like this. After some thought…</p>



<p>「It’s
true that I don’t have much knowledge. I get that. But, I know about you because
it’s normal for me to investigate about my client
to some extent in advance. Besides, I know that you’re a student from Bolvato,
a location east from here. I
did just a small research, but it was enough to give me an understanding your
character. After all, you are a known student of ancient and modern
magic at that school.」</p>



<p>After I answered back at Filaret’s words, I
started walking ahead while chewing some tobacco.</p>



<p>Of course, I didn’t investigate her. However, according to what I heard
during the rescue party, people said that she was a devoted researcher of magic
in Garoua Maria. I heard
that she amassed accomplishments very early on. She was named a genius
of her expertise. So, it was obvious she wasn’t an ordinary person.</p>



<p>「…Ah, I
knew it. You probably received the request after hearing about me. I’m probably
a foolish person, you know. I’m a girl from the outside, but I’m much crazier
from the inside.」</p>



<p>I was amazed at everything she said to me. What were those words? Were
those masochistic words?&nbsp; Or were they,
perhaps, a joke? This was not a laughing matter.</p>



<p>「Hey, give me a break. You are a very talented person. You don’t look like a fool to me.」</p>



<p>「Talented?
Hmm…Don’t say unreasonable things. But, if I don’t seem like a fool to you,
okay then. Does that mean that you think that I’ll succeed as a Sorceress?」</p>



<p>「Of
course. And, you’re no fool. Yeah, that’s why I accepted your request in the
first place.」</p>



<p>I didn’t understand this at all. I heard that she was a woman full of
talent from a very young age. Naturally, if someone had to bet on her future as
a Sorceress, anyone would say that her future would be full of glory. But, it
was confusing. This person, who always acted as if I were a mouse to her, was
actually listening to what I had to say.</p>



<p>For a brief moment, our voices became silent. It was obvious, because
we’ve arrived to a particular location in the darkness of the underground
temple.</p>



<p>I was glad that we managed
to reach our destination safely.</p>



<p>「Well, we’re here, miss employer. This is your destination, right?」</p>



<p>I could hear Filaret’s heavy breath. She seemed astonished and happy at
the same time. It looked like she wasn’t able to sort out her own emotions. But,
she certainly had a very good expression on her face.</p>



<p>The place we arrived after coming from a darkish narrow passage was a
large Basilica. I see, so this was the main hall of the underground temple.
This was the true destination of Filaret. The ancient place that kept the
knowledge of the heraldic
order.</p>
