<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 6: Inverted Reality, Nightmares Always Have Beautiful Faces</h2>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[The &lt;White
Knights&gt; have annihilated enemies that threaten the peace of the empire!]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Another proud piece of
news has arrived. The antisocial organization &lt;The Great Iron Hammer&gt;,
which had been holding radical demonstrations around the capital for some time,
was annihilated in a raid by an elite unit of the &lt;White Knights&gt;. The
heroes discovered a hideout in the basement of a restaurant in the outskirts of
the capital and, after a desperate battle, vanquished the enemies of the
empire. The organization was effectively destroyed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result of this
battle, Nacht Grossman, the ringleader of the &lt;Great Iron Hammer&gt;, and
all of its executives were killed. Meanwhile, no casualties were reported on
the side of the &lt;White Knights&gt;.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">All of the executives
were killed</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">the information, which
seemed to have been supplemented by necessity, was burned into her retinas and
wouldn't go away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The national newspaper
was read by the butler as part of her daily routine. Nina, who was nine years
old at the time, made it a habit to look for news about the &lt;White
Knights&gt;, to which her two older brothers belonged, first thing in the
morning.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was 13 years old
apart from her eldest brother, Victor, and 10 years old from her second
brother, Haine, and had no recollection of ever having played together before.
Now that they have graduated from the Heiberg School and joined the &lt;White
Knights&gt;, the only way to connect with them was through newspaper articles
describing their activities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Are they really my older brothers?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Such a question always
lingered in her little head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was hard to believe
that Nina, who had no choice but to live her life lying to everyone around her
about her psychic abilities, and these people, who continuously fought the
enemies of the country as heroes of salvation, had any blood connection at all.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Above all, the
ruthless and confident atmosphere they wore was something Nina could never
understand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On a day that seemed
to end in a mundane and boring manner, an unexpected change occurred.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As usual, Nina was
playing with a frog doll in her room when a voice called out to her from
behind.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hello Nina, are
you playing by yourself as usual?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina felt a shiver as
her head was being patted along with a gentle voice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">She didn't have to
turn around to know. This voice, this cold hand, this touch</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Haine-niisan."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's been a
while, Nina. Can you show me your face?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she turned around
to do as she was told, there she saw a vacant smile that she hadn't seen in two
years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His slightly permed
hair has the same platinum color as Nina's. His eyes are a slightly deeper
shade of indigo than Nina's, and he cast a penetrating glance at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An inhumanly
good-looking face, as if designed by a heartless being based on cold
calculations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although he wore a
soft smile, she knew very well that it was nothing more than an elaborate
fabrication.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Why are
you here, brother Haine?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I just finished
a big job and got a short vacation."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What big
job?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I've been
fighting some bad guys."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Surely, it was about that article.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who had
extraordinary insight even back then, saw the truth hidden in the abyss beneath
her brother's eyes. Nonetheless, she was only nine years old and didn't know
much about how things really worked around the world. She couldn't help but put
a lid on the questions that popped into her head and smile as if nothing had
happened.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But before she
realized it, her lips were moving.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, why did you
kill all those bad people? You should have just arrested them......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha, Nina sure
says some interesting things."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her brother's next
words imprinted an unforgettable horror in the young Nina's heart.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There's no point
in keeping a toy that you've finished playing with forever, is there?"</span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............~!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What awaited Nina upon
waking up from her nightmare was another kind of nightmare.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was seated in a
wooden chair, her hands restrained behind her back with ropes. In the dimly lit
room stood Emma Licorice, with her icy eyes, pointing the tip of a knife at
her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her still hazy mind
chased the remnants of the nightmare.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why did I remember
that now?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Was it because that
was the moment I first felt the fear of death?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Was it because I
regretted having drifted to a place like this?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The conclusion Nina
arrived at was no more helpful than either of those.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma, who was trying
to kill her, is a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt; and a pawn of the
school's headmaster. Naturally, she would have inherited the same mindset as
the heroes of salvation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I would be killed.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the most cruel way
imaginable, in a manner that would never be published in the national
newspapers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After thinking of
this, Nina realized she was wondering why she had not been killed in the
gunfire earlier.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You have the
look of someone who doesn't know why she's still alive."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma pulled a shiny
black pistol from inside her black coat.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Taser - a
non-lethal weapon that ejects a wired needle charged with a high-voltage
electric current. That's all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......What's
that? I've never seen that before."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course not.
It's not even available in the Empire."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Why would
Emma have such a thing?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It would be
unnatural for a death by gunshot to take place at a school for psychics. That
is the only reason."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Death by gunshot.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina couldn't hide her
fear that such a disturbing word was coming out of Emma's mouth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the moment they
first exchanged words, Emma had always been disguising her true nature. She had
no idea that the real Emma was such a ruthless, thorough, and terrifying
person.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">From the very beginning, I was the only one who
thought we were friends.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's all too late.
There is no hope left.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And yet, Nina still
didn't want to let go of her life.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... You have
good guts, by the way. Don't you know what it means to antagonize me?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she is
helpless and there is no way out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's only
because of my mercy that you're still breathing, you know?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though fear and
despair are driving her crazy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At the count of
five, you must disappear from my presence, Emma-san."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if the memory of
having laughed together is shattered and sharp shards pierce her skin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What's
wrong? Do you want to be dismembered?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, Nina kept up
her bluff.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no longer
any need to act tough. She could no longer even put on the mask she wore. Like
a helpless child, she just threw out words that had no substance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl in front of
her chuckled as though she could see through Nina's weakness.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're not
convincing if you say that to me while crying."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Droplets of water
trickling down Nina's cheeks dripped onto her feet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was so distraught
that she herself didn't even realize she was crying.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In such a state, there
was no way she could perform in a way that would make the other party believe
her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who had
gradually become calm, noticed another fatal fact.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A......A......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Here she is in the
hidden room in the attic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;">A room that can only
be accessed by holding the longest bamboo broom upside down in the cleaning kit
compartment, stacking crates for height, and climbing a rope ladder that
descends when certain spots on the ceiling are pushed up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No one but them knew
of the room's existence.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What
happened to Jin?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma did not reply.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Where in the
world is he!? How did you know about this room!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no answer.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, tell me,
....... Jin is my accomplice, without him I am nothing, and he is my
first-......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With despair
overflowing from the edges of her heart, Nina was at a loss for words.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The &lt;White
Knights&gt; will do anything they can to force their targets to disclose
information. The fact that Emma, who follows their will, is here, in other
words, indicates such.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina could not imagine
what kind of torture had befallen Jin.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Please, Emma,
tell me......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I have been deceiving people for so long, what am I
crying about?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her calm self inside
her head asked sharply.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">That's right.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">I have no
right to blame Emma for deceiving Karen, Casper, and so many other people whose
names I don't even know.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">I have no
right to wallow in grief or demand answers.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Losers are
losers, and the only thing they can do is to say nothing and accept their
fate......</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Emma,
you've gone too far."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the corner of the
darkened room, a dismayed voice could be heard.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With desperation, Nina
turned her eyes toward the voice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin came out of the
darkness with an uncomfortable expression on his face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've told you
many times that Nina is not a psychic. So don't be so cautious. And please
untie her restraints."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a reluctant look
on her face, Emma approached with a knife in her hand. Nina unintentionally
braced herself, but the only thing being cut was the rope that tied her to the
chair.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What the-, eh?
Eeehh~!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Well,
sorry for deceiving you. There were a lot of circumstances."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina alternately
looked at Jin and Emma's faces.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't tell me, these two were in cahoots?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Emma is the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, the target they were looking for, and they couldn't let
her know who they were, so this situation is absolutely strange......</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, I knew it
was confusing."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-What the hell
is going on!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Fine,
I'll explain it to you."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma opened her heavy
mouth as she put the knife away inside her black coat.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">One Day Prior</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">＊</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......I won't
hesitate any longer."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a somber
determination, she put on her mask again and turned back the way she had just
fled from.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason why the
earlier attack failed was because the other party was fully prepared. And no
matter how much special training she has had, it would have been foolish to go
head-to-head with Nina Stingray, a monster beyond human comprehension.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara should be
the one to be eliminated first.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the only possible
time to do so would be when he is all alone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He would probably be
heading back to the men's dormitory after parting ways with Nina, so an ambush
during that time would be the optimal time.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara walked
down the path at night, lined only with unreliable streetlights.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, Nina was
not in the vicinity. The man with an air of strategist was walking with his
hands in his pockets, naively thinking that she had already let him off the
hook for today.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hiding in the bushes
by the side of the road, she clutched two knives.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Kill your heart.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She repeated what she
needed to do over and over in her mind before she attacked Jin from behind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, she severed the
tendons in both of his legs, causing him to fall over, and then she strangled
his neck, knocking him out and carrying him to an abandoned place. Then gently
interrogate him to find out how much he knows.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She closed in on him
at a speed far beyond that of a normal person, but Jin reacted in a way she
could not believe.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An intense light
obscured her vision.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It must be from a
powerful military flashlight. By the time she regained her vision, Jin had
already disappeared from her sight.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't tell me, he predicted my pursuit ......?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she was
stunned by the other party's preparedness, she was in no hurry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even in this darkness,
she could clearly see the back of Jin's figure as he fled frantically. Her
target had veered off the street and was now running through a wooded area with
no streetlights.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... He
underestimated me."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She put away her knife
and lunged at her distant prey in a nocturnal beast-like stance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two were about
twelve meters apart, but only five steps were enough for her to catch up to her
prey.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her psychic ability of
&lt;Ferocious Sweetener&gt;, which allows her to double her physical abilities
only while holding a lollipop in her mouth, hides two lies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first is that the
increase in physical ability is not necessarily double.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only are sensory
organs such as eyesight and hearing, or simple arm strength, but leg strength,
nerve transmission speed, and joint strength, which are directly related to
[movement speed], are also increased by an average of about 136%. The only reason
she can achieve inhuman movements is because her original physical abilities
far exceed those of ordinary people.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the other lie is
probably not important to Jin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because this man would
run out of strength before he could find out about it.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your physical
ability is too weak. Are you really a man?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She pounced on Jin
from behind, entangling her right leg between both of his flailing legs and
causing him to fall over.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She then mounted on
top of Jin, who had rolled flat on his back, and held his shoulders with both
knees to stop him from resisting. After pulling a knife out of her pocket and
holding it to his throat, she would be able to mow down any resistance he might
have had.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You are
finished, Jin Kirihara. If you don't want to die, tell me everything you
know."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait, you're
hurrying things too fast! Have people ever told you that you lack a sense of
courtesy?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To make light talk at
this point is just like a death wish.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You have a fatal
lack of imagination. Don't you understand your current situation?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright, calm
down, Emma."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This guy knows who I am.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The [Emma] who usually
interacts with Jin is a completely different persona from the one she has now.
They don't even share the same memories. No matter how observant one might be,
it would be impossible to discern her true identity.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What kind of

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry, but I guess
not at the moment."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She jumped away from
the top of Jin, noticing several stares directed at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Men armed with knives

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm getting a
lot of extra money for this, so leave it to me. ...... By the way, Jin, is this
the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead of answering,
Jin stood up with a victor's smile on his face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A man who would truly

turned, I guess. Drop the knife for now, Emma."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as Jin said, the
board was completely turned upside down.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The armed men were
slowly closing the distance between them, and with each passing second, Emma
could see her escape route disappearing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">And, so what?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You guys
are too naive."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She knew from the
start that they were hiding in the perimeter. No matter how hard they tried to
hide in the dark, they could not fool her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fully aware of all
this, she dared to take Jin's bait.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't see a
single person here with military experience. ......Ah, don't be surprised. It's
easy to tell from their posture that they have no formal training. And none of

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She twirls the knife
in her palm.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An obvious
provocation. But when she saw that the men did not move, she strengthened her
conviction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What she was saying
was neither a threat nor wishful thinking.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Surely everyone here

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His eyes, darker than

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ah, of course, I'm not
saying anything untrue.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If you doubt me, I'll
tell you. How did I know who you were?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, I thought about
the meaning of the [Nice to meet you] message that was left in Bennett's room.
It was a note you put on the back of Bennett's table just before he was
expelled, because you knew I was going to investigate his room. Of course you
remember that, don't you?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When I found the
message, I was a bit flustered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At first, I thought it
was a declaration of war.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A &lt;Shepherd's
Dog&gt; knew that his presence was being tracked, and he was making the first
move. I thought he knew that we were trying to catch him off guard by
deliberately making a suspicious move.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, it's normal to
be paranoid when one gets such a love letter.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fear of having my
true identity exposed, I became unable to trust anyone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I will be forced to
act recklessly in order to track down the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; as soon as
possible.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, one day, everything
will collapse and I'll be among those being purged.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">.......But, you know
what?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When I think about it
calmly, isn't such an action very risky for the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; as well?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to my
information, there is one &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; in each grade who is assigned
by the headmaster to weed out those who pose a threat to the school. They have
to remain in the shadows for three years without even letting anyone know there
is a spy in the school.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's why it made me
wonder. Would such a person go out of his way to make us feel rushed and make
us engage in a desperate battle?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Is it because of his
belligerent nature? Was he bored with his mundane life?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it's hard to
believe that the headmaster, who is so secretive that he doesn't even show his
face at the entrance ceremony, would appoint such a person as a spy. At the
very least, it would be unnatural for the &lt;Shepher's Dog&gt; to make a
flashy move without any solid evidence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If so, what was that
message all about?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">One who would benefit
from making us impatient and forcing us to search for the &lt;Shepherd's
Dog&gt;</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In other words, it
can't be anyone other than someone who is looking for a common target with us,
right?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I don't think there's
anything sweeter than being able to achieve your goals while sitting
comfortably in your chair and not taking any risks. I'm not dumb enough to be
manipulated with a mere piece of paper, though.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...... Well, let's
move on to the next question.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why is he looking for
the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Personal reasons?
Simple curiosity?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, none of the above.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no way any
ordinary person could have known about the existence of the &lt;Shepherd's
Dog&gt;. Even the country's best-informed detective, Mr. Heath, knew nothing
about it until he found that man's diary.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...... Since that's
the case, the answers are naturally limited, no?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A person who is
willing to put his life on the line to uncover the secrets that this school is
hiding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A force that is
hostile to the school - or rather, to the empire itself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In other words, the only possible answer is a spy from
an enemy country.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Could the purpose be
to find out the secret of the psychic abilities that the Empire has a monopoly
on? I never thought that there would be such a crazy country that would send
their children to Heiberg Academy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Aa~, you don't have to
be so speechless.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's not like I came
up with this answer right off the bat either. So it doesn't mean you weren't
careful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In fact, when I found
the message, I had no basis for linking Emma to a spy. Emma was just a good,
surprisingly easygoing girl after all.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And there was no sign
that she was pretending at all. It was hard to believe that there were so many
acting geniuses in the world, so much so that I would normally have left Emma
off the mark.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, of course, there
was nothing wrong with that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if she had the
ability to double her physical abilities, Emma's physical performance was far
too skilled for an ordinary student. I thought it would be strange if she had
not received special training in the military or something.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Also, the extent of
her friendships was also strange.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In my professional
life, I always assume that people who have a lot of friends are either scammers
or spies. I thought it was not surprising that Emma was expanding her network
for some purpose.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, I didn't find
anything strange when I had a detective check her background, and she didn't
even notice it until the next day when I planted a bug in her uniform.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">......Huh? Are you mad
at me?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, do forgive me.
It's only natural to investigate if you find someone even slightly suspicious.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Anyway, no matter how
much time went by, Emma didn't show her tail. So I decided to conclude that
Emma was just a good-natured girl.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Until, at the very
last moment, I learned the results of the analysis of the candy I secretly
stole from you.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...... Ah, looks like
you're shocked now. This time I can tell even if you're wearing a mask.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But, well, I was
genuinely surprised, too. When I heard the results of the analysis from a
vendor I know, I honestly thought there must be some kind of mistake.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Who would have thought
that candy was a cutting-edge doping item?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">You're even more of a liar than me, you know that?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I don't have the
slightest clue about chemical ingredients, but here's what I'm trying to say.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma, you are not a
psychic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Your &lt;Ferocious
Sweetener&gt; was just a scam to forcibly increase your muscle strength with
drugs.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...... Oh, and by the
way, now we know about where you come from.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Magical science and
technology, a few steps ahead of the Empire - none other than the Republic,
which is in the midst of a raging cold war with the Empire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Right, and when did I
steal it?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sorry, I'm a skeptical
person after all. About a month ago, when I had a little tiff with Bennett, I
was able to snatch a piece of candy out of your hand. Well, I didn't suspect
you of being a spy at the time. It took me so long to analyze it that I forgot
about it until I got the results a week ago.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As for the rest, well,
it's just as you've imagined, Emma.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I had been diligently
spraying a slow-acting poison to force you into a reckless attack.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I spread rumors
throughout the school that enemy spies had infiltrated the empire, I made you
impatient by stealing your paper bag of candy, and to top it all off, I wrote
scribbles on the classroom blackboard announcing the existence of &lt;rats&gt;
.......</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that time, you must
have been thinking like this:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">These people know my true identity.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If I don't erase them as soon as possible, the truth
will get in the headmaster's ear.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If I'm going to do it, I'll do it today. I'll ambush
them after school when they're alone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking at our
situation right now, it looks like everything I said was right on the money.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">So, Emma. What are you
going to do now?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For now, if you have
any rebuttals, let's hear them first."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She took off her mask
and stared at the man in front of her with her dark green eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The deductions he had
told her were generally correct.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Indeed, she is a
Republic spy who infiltrated the academy to find out the secrets of the
psychics whose powers are monopolized by the empire. It seems that he doesn't
even know her true background, that she faked her identity when she was nine
years old and started living with a collaborator, but that is meaningless since
a more fatal truth has been exposed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, it was
completely unexpected that the Jin would also use the strategy of [pushing the
other party into committing a reckless act].</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">How shall I get rid of them?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thinking so, she
clenched her knives in both hands.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She does not know what
kind of deal this guy is offering, but she can't let him live as long as her
secret is known.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if he is willing
to keep his mouth shut, the &lt;White Knights&gt; can easily force him to spill
everything he knows. She had seen too many of her comrades betray their own
country because they could not bear the suffering, and then they were cruelly
killed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Look, I have no
intention of making a deal."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You want to kill
us all instead? Aren't you being a little too aggressive?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're after the
&lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt;, too, aren't you? You don't even understand that it's
not something that mere civilians are allowed to venture into. ......There's a
limit to how stupid one can be. Why don't you realize that it's the kindest
thing I could do for you to let you die before you are subjected to Empire-style
torture?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Whoa~, sounds
like you don't trust us at all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course. How
did you guys get this information about the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; in the first
place?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The informant's
name is Rusty. Rusty Yellowkid Wale.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............Wha!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Why does that name come up here?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Rusty is so well-known
in the Empire that he is known as the &lt;Legendary Fraudster&gt;. There is no
way anyone would have expected that Rusty would have a connection with a young
boy like him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The truth is,
Rusty is like a foster parent to me. I was living on the streets when my real
parents abandoned me, and he took me in."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't give me
that bullshit! Because you're-......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Son of a
railroad worker? Haha, everything you've investigated about my background is
all lies. Well, we both are on the same page about that, aren't we?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her brain froze in
shock at the shocking turn of events.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was stunned with
her mouth agape, and Jin gave her an ambiguous smile.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Rusty always
told me, that a big job requires a strong group of people to match it. So I
gathered up some of that man's old associates, and I also formed an accomplice
relationship with Nina. ...... So, Emma, now it's your turn."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin slowly walked
toward her, not caring about the sharp blade pointed at him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Completely unarmed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no hint of
hostility, let alone any hint of trickery.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In the journal
Rusty left behind, he wrote that he had entrusted the school's secrets and
information about the &lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; to a friend in a foreign country.
Emma, since you're here ...... it looks like that friend was a spy of the
Republic."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She almost dropped the
knife.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Republic obtained
the information about the &lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; when Rusty Yellowkid Wale
suddenly contacted a Republic agent and leaked the information to them. Of
course, she was not informed of the name of the agent who received the
information, but she at least knew that the Central Intelligence Agency counted
Rusty as one of their heroes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The boy who was raised
by him appeared before her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">She never thought
there would be such a coincidence</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... No, it
wasn't."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This is not a coincidence.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps Jin had
suspected from the beginning that an agent of the Republic might be hiding
among the students.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason he was so
noticeable in his grand standoff with Bennett early in the school year was not
just to attract the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;'s attention.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He might have been
aiming to recruit enemy spies into his ranks all along.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I see,
I've been lured out, huh?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, now, why do
you look so frustrated?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin said with a
confident smile.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Shouldn't we be
celebrating our alliance?"</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So I heard the
truth from this guy. I know what you guys are up to, and I also know that Nina
...... you've been playing the part of someone with psychic abilities for a
long time."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, to get her
to trust us, we have to disclose information to her."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Is it
some kind of your strategy to go out of your way to mention such a
calculation?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't point your
knife at me now. What would you do if I were Aichmophobic?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her accomplice turned
a mischievous smile toward her, while shrugging his shoulders in dismay.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Well,
that's how it is, Nina. The only reason I haven't told you about it is because
I wasn't sure I could get Emma to join us."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even as he explained
this, Nina was still unable to decide where to place her emotions.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">So Emma is now
one of our accomplices?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Nina's mind
was still haunted by the intense murderous intent of the masked assailant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Perhaps Emma is still harboring a hatred toward me.</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin Kirihara,
there remains one problem. I still don't trust this monster."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma moved in closer,
still holding the knife that radiated a sinister pressure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's right to even
blink was sealed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina Stingray.
Your two older brothers were members of the &lt;White Knights&gt;, weren't
they?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Yeah."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Many of my
compatriots have been killed by the &lt;White Knights&gt;. You won't find any
mention in the newspapers of the brutality they have endured."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma's eyes were
completely devoid of light as she said this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina knew nothing of
the life that lay behind them. Nor can she even fathom the exact hell that a
young girl who was ordered to infiltrate an enemy country during the Cold War
has been through.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Among those killed by
her brothers, there might have been someone important to her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"One of the
agents was found with every part of her body severed by saws. Next to the
limb-missing body were four buckets filled with chunks of dismembered flesh.
Later, a colleague examined the buckets and found that the combined weight of
the buckets was exactly half the weight of the agent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A young agent, who was
about to get married, had been starved to death while embedded in the wall by a
psychic ability. Infuriatingly, a large amount of food was apparently piled up
under the wall. It is impossible to even imagine the despair she must have
felt, having food right in front of her and yet being unable to move until the
very end."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I'm,
sorry. I don't know anything about it."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thinking back, she
felt she had made a similar apology to Jin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was also Nina's
brothers who had killed his foster parent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But it never occurred
to her that they had slaughtered them in such a cruel manner. Or perhaps her
mind refused to imagine it. She was not made to be an insensitive creature, to
be able to live with impunity after knowing such details.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the first place,
the hell Emma has just described is probably just the tip of the iceberg.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just how many people
had sacrificed so much to make her luxurious life in that mansion possible?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just thinking about
it, she felt something boiling inside her heart.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I would never
defend what my brothers did, saying that they had no choice because it was
their job. Because those people were indeed cruel ....... And perhaps the only
reason they joined the &lt;White Knights&gt; was because they could legally
hurt people."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So? Are you
willing to take the blame for it?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina stared back into
the dark green eyes that were looking right through her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Half-hearted acting
would not do at this moment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She must speak her
true feelings, which lie at the root of her being, without any lies or deceit.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Within no time at all,
Nina knew what she had to say.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Sorry,
Emma. That will have to wait a bit."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... I've
been thinking about it. Do I have a strong enough will to accomplish my goal,
even if it means deceiving many people, even if it means carrying many
sins?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's soliloquy
continued, as if to connect her just-begotten feelings to the world.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I couldn't
muster up the same level of resolve as Jin, who had his foster parent taken
away from him. Because of that, before I knew it, I found myself in a state of
half-hearted guilt."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her vision, which had
been so cloudy, became crystal clear all at once.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It might just be that
her eyes have become accustomed to the dimness, but Nina has certainly found
her courage.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But finally
...... I found the meaning of what I'm standing here for."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason why she
must move forward, even if it means deceiving someone, even if it means hurting
that someone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A solid reason to face
her fate and not run away from her karma as a fraudster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason for her to
lie.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Only now, Nina was
able to find the answer.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I want to expose
the crimes of my two brothers in the &lt;White Knights&gt;. I want to defeat
them with my own hands before they cause anyone more suffering. I want to
expose the sins of the demons who killed Jin's foster parent and Emma's
compatriots."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you prepared
to commit more crimes to achieve that? Are you willing to risk your life for
it? Answer me, fraudster."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm ready.
...... I can't tolerate those people any longer."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A curtain of silence
fell over the hidden room in the attic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Time passed for what
seemed like an eternity as they stared into each other's eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Like sheep waiting for
the hour of judgment, no one said anything.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I'm
relieved then."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was Emma who broke
the silence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She put away the knife
in her black coat and gently held out her right hand.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Righteous
indignation, huh...... Well, that's not a bad motive. At least it's better than
some feeble reason like atonement for your sins. If you were to say such a
thing, I would have abandoned you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Emma, would you
please stop testing my precious accomplice?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We're not in
this for fun, you know. So what I did was only natural."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After saying this in a
discouraged manner, Emma suddenly whispered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... By the
way, don't call me by that name. I've told you many times. I am not Emma
Licorice now.""</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who was relieved
to be recognized by her new accomplice, couldn't miss what she had just said.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Hmm? What
do you mean?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"See, Nina is
confused because you say such confusing things."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm just telling
you the truth. Emma and I are completely different personalities. Besides, Emma
is not even aware of my existence."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she was
supposed to be hearing a shocking fact, Nina was strangely convinced.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The normal Emma and
the girl in front of her seem so far removed from each other. It was definitely
not a level that could be managed by mere acting.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she is a different
persona, then that is probably the truth.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's your
name, then?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I'm an
intelligence agent. I don't need a name."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eeh, that's kind
of a pain in the ass. Wouldn't it be too inconvenient not to have a name to
call you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wha-, what the
hell ......? "You catch an enemy nation's spy, and it's an inconvenience,
you say......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright, for
convenience's sake, I'll call you Fake Emma."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Just call me
Emma, then! Are you messing with me?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">An accomplice who
could draw even an enemy agent into his pace is indeed too dependable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A chuckle
involuntarily spilled out from Nina's light-colored lips.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A genius fraudster who was raised by a legendary
villain who made enemies of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A monster who has two older brothers who belong to the
&lt;White Knights&gt; and whose name is known throughout the empire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">And a skilled intelligence agent sent from the
Republic, which is in a cold war with the Empire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If these three
dangerous individuals work together, they can turn any miracle into an
inevitability.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They can deceive this
world filled with lies with even more lies.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, let's wrap
these emotional moments up. There is still work to be done."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin's dark eyes lit up
with a vicious light.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Let's sort
things out for now. First, our common goal is to identify and capture the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;. He's been playing heavy-handed tactics to find the rat
that snuck into the school."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're the one
who led him to do that, are you not?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two of them seemed
to already have an idea of who the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; was.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And Nina wondered if
it was the same person who had popped into her mind.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, either
way, we won't survive unless we defeat Karen. Apparently, she's not going to
stop using her &lt;Jolly Undertaker&gt; until she sees our dead bodies."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The current Karen
Ashby has every justification for eliminating you two. I'm sure she's not even
concerned that someone will suspect her connection to the headmaster after such
a bold rampage."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Wait a second!
Karen is on a rampage because Satya, her maid, was attacked, right? If so, who
attacked Satya?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, of course,
she made that up."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's
......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">You mean that
she attacked her own best friend just to create a good reason to attack us?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">No, but ......
there was not the slightest hint of cheap lies from the Karen I just met with.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The first thing that
came to mind was a possibility that Nina wanted to deny.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Self-brainwashing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the same method
that Nina herself had used to defeat Bennett in the past. By believing that it
was someone other than herself who attacked Satya, Karen was able to lie with a
high degree of accuracy. And it was easy to assume that she has a talent for
self-brainwashing from the way she practiced &lt;conditioning&gt; in the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's arms and legs
trembled on their own.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her throat felt dry, and
her vision suddenly blurred.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I am going to fight with such a monster now?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... So, why
are you guys smiling? Do you even aware of our current sotuation?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was only after Emma
told her this that Nina realized she was not in the slightest bit in despair.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fear and elation. Two
conflicting emotions, and yet Nina held them together without contradiction.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because, you
know, it's not every day you get to see such a fun turn of events."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing the edge of
Jin's mouth lifted up in front of her, she remembered the golden rule she had
been told once.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">A truly elaborate lie is like a kind of art.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In Jin's mind now, a
grand scheme of lies is being constructed to defeat that monster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina wanted to hear
the whole details as soon as possible. She wanted to join in on this ruse that
would deceive the entire world.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry Emma, I
feel the same way as he does."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she said so, her
new accomplice let out a sigh with a stunned expression on her face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Did I
make a mistake in who I made an alliance with?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Laughing off Emma's
sarcasm, Jin began to explain his next plans.</span></p>
