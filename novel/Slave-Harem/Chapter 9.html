<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;To the bedroom. ......! It's a very big bed, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I had just conquered a dungeon and had some money, so I bought one. We can sleep three people in it. By the way, it's a bit lonely when you sleep alone.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master. I'm sure the floor is enough for this pervert&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Li-Lilia-san is cold ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Cold is the floor on which a pervert woman sleeps.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ehh&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In addition to the main storage room, there are three other rooms in the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The first is the pantry, the second is the bathroom, and the third is the bedroom where the three of them were now.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The bed is a huge one that looks like two king-size beds stuck together, and if you pack it up, it can sleep about ten people together.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had bought it on the spur of the moment when he was still alone. It was a move based on a slight yearning for a hotel suite.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was inexpensive for its size. The furniture maker had received an order from a noble to make it, but it had not been bought, and there was no one else to buy it, so he was able to get a very low price.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There are other rooms as well, so why don't the pervert women just lie down in those rooms? Also, pervert women are not allowed in the pantry. She might eat up all the precious food.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I won't eat it! Besides, I want to sleep in the bed too!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">These two don't get along ....... It's like Lilia is one-sidedly hostile to Hazuki. I'd like to see them get along a little better. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No problem. Let's all sleep together. Why don't you two go take a bath while I make dinner? Do you have a change of clothes, Hazuki-chan?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah......I was in a hurry and left all my stuff. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Foolish. I was wondering why you were empty-handed, but do you usually forget your luggage? You can't just piggyback on Master for everything. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-Because at that time, I was in a hurry, and ......&#8213;&#8213;Can I ...... borrow some clothes?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My clothes are my size. In short, a pervert woman does not have enough breasts. Isn't it a cliff your breast is? Even though you're a pervert woman.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's clothes are custom-made, ordered by Mars, so they are Lilia's big tits size. Because Mars preferred clothes that show off the lines of her body, when Hazuki wears them, they are too big.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although Hazuki's lower body is sexual, her breasts are sadly small.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While hiding her breasts, Hazuki kept her mouth agape at Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, that's a bit early to tell. You are both not very tall, so even Hazuki-chan can find something to wear. &#8213;&#8213;A sailor clothes. The winter version. The one I just showed earlier.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is also a white one for summer clothes. He made it because he wanted to play with uniforms. Mars wanted to regain his lost youth, but he didn't use them because they were somewhat cosplay customs. It was a little different from the texture of the real thing. The others didn't bother him because he had never seen them in person, but it was a different story when it came to the familiar uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sailor clothes ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right. The one Lilia had never worn before. Hazuki-chan might look better than Lilia in this case, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki has black hair and is plain. And she has a committee chairman look, so the sailor clothes would look great on her. He wants her to wear glasses too.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Murgh. No, that's not possible. I am definitely better than these pathetic breasts.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pathetic breast!? I-it's certainly not as good as Lilia-san, but!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Not as much, wait I corrected myself, it's almost none, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia glared at her as she quickly and unceremoniously reached for Hazuki's chest and began to rub it without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her breasts were thin, but they felt soft and slightly tender.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars stared in silence. It had been a long time since he had seen two women milking(?) each other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aahh! R-rubbing is....! Nnhhh......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What are you feeling? You don't even have enough to rub. &#8213;&#8213;You're not wearing anything on top, do you?.......... With your nipples so hard......Such a pervert bitch.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki twisted her body as Lilia pinched Hazuki's nipples through her clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her face, voice, and breath were the same as when she was feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To Mars, it looked like Hazuki was being rather rough, but she looked like she was feeling good.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;She was a pervert. And M-ish.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even Lilia wouldn't feel much unless the atmosphere was like that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars saw that Hazuki's knees were starting to buckle, he turned the subject back to the food.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;L-Let's eat! Is there anything you can't eat, Hazuki-chan!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh, ahh....I-I'd rather be touched by someone than touch myself. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-That's disgusting. ......! The same woman touches you and makes you squeal like a dog,......, don't you feel ashamed!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's feels weird and ...... i-it's embarrassing, but it feels so good. ...... Ma-Mars-san is watching me feel it. ......! I-It feels so good. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><i>&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I knew this girl was an M pervert!</i></p>
<p class="calibre"><i>&#12288;Is this the kind of girl who is into exposure play or goes out with a rotor!?</i></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was surprised and excited by this new race he had never encountered before.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's gross!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Haeeh!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Lilia squeezed her fingertips and then pulled her hand away, Hazuki let out a distracting sound and slumped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nnghh, nnhh.....&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Could it be that Hazuki-chan came with just her nipples ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;L-lightly ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You pervert!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This time, Hazuki responded to the "pervert" by simply blushing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no denying the way she was shaking and shivering.</p>
<p class="calibre" style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was taking a bath and Hazuki was waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki borrowed Lilia's camisole, underwear, and shorts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Meanwhile, Mars was cooking dinner in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since Hazuki tries to cook everything anyway, Mars decides not to let her participate in the cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It would be too much to let the food turn to charcoal. Mars is a farmer by birth and knows the hardships of making food, so he is very picky about food waste.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was looking at the items in the room with a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's favorite food is a simple dish of grilled meat with salt and pepper and other spices.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the middle of the treasure house, a room full of shelves was used as the living room and kitchen because it was the largest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is particular about his cooking utensils and has them custom-made by craftsmen from his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The weaponsmith was more dexterous than Mars had expected, and he was able to make them with just a simple drawing and explanation of their purpose. However, he feels that the price was quite a rip-off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From the pantry, Mars took out ingredients one after another and thought about how much to make. If it's just him and Lilia, he doesn't need that much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He brought in mainly vegetables because Lilia likes them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No matter how much you bring in, it won't go to waste because it won't go bad in the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;, where things never go to waste.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I think I'll make a little more ...... because I don't know what Hazuki-chan's stomach is like.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, as Lilia said, I feel that Hazuki is the incarnation of the three major desires, so more is probably the right answer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia came back from the bath switched with Hazuki and came to Mars with an indescribably subtle expression on her face and began to help with the cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars could feel the uncanny presence of Lilia as she continued to chop up more vegetables than were clearly necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was dressed in a nightgown with long sleeves and long pants - she rarely sleeps in them - and her breasts looked smaller than usual because she was not wearing underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's expression was indescribable, and she seemed unable to say anything, so Mars called out to her. He knew what she wanted to say.<br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;About Hazuki-chan, you don't like her?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I have no complaints about what Master has decided. But if I'm honest with myself, I don't like it. It boggles my mind that Master would sexually look at that female. &#8213;&#8213;I guess I'm just more jealous than I thought I was. It was something I'd originally said to myself.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a clunk, Lilia's eyes widen and she drops the knife on the cutting board.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm scared of Lilia holding the knife.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Lilia is not such a menhera</span><sup><a href="#down1" id="up1">1</a></sup><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;character, but she can stab me .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Worst case scenario, I'm going to have to activate the slave crest for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;At least if that woman is a slave, I can forgive her to a certain extent. As long as she is in the same position, she is like tools that are used in different ways. I can tolerate it if she is treated only as a tool to satisfy your sexual needs. I definitely don't want my heart to drift away, but I don't feel like losing if she's in the same position. But as it stands, she's not a slave, and she's getting my own Master's sexual attention. I just can't accept that. I never thought I'd feel this way myself.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's an air of slavery about her if I tell you. ...... But I can't have sex with Hazuki-chan. Unlike Lilia, she can get pregnant. I've been able to put up with her for a while now, she's like a friend. She's fun to watch, too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The main reason why Mars doesn't touch Hazuki even though he's horny is because of the pregnancy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To put it simply, Mars doesn't want to be responsible for Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is currently someone else's girlfriend, and he feels guilty about impregnating her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But it was also true that he was interested in that guilt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He doesn't mind if Lilia gets pregnant. He'd rather welcome it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But he had only just met Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Mars had to choose between liking her and disliking her, he would say he liked her, but not the way he felt about Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can only get pregnant once a year. ...... This is where I realize that I live in a different time than humans. I would like to have a baby with Master, Mars. Not only mentally, but also instinctively, I would like to have the child of a strong male. Perhaps that pervert woman is the same way. I'm sure she's not like that with everyone.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As an elf, Lilia differs from humans in the span of her ovulation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She only ovulates about once a year, so her chances of getting pregnant are slim.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd like to impregnate Lilia too because there's a part of me that wants to do it every day. I don't know what it is, but when I do it with Lilia, the amount of cum that comes out and the pleasure that I feel is amazing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's have lots of sex today &#9825; I've heard that the children of elves and humans are very beautiful &#9825;.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I want to, but not today. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;On the bed where Hazuki-chan........<span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder what it would be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's subtly distracting .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Didn't you think she was in the way just now, Master?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ugh ......,th-that's not true&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two continued cooking in a delicate atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he had finished making the seven items, Mars said something that had been bothering him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Isn't she late, that Hazuki-chan? How long is she gonna taking a bath?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She's probably hiding and masturbating anyway. She's pervert woman, after all, &#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's not the case... I can't say there's no such thing. I'm going to take a look.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><br class="calibre1" /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars listens carefully in front of the bathroom door. He was a little nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a changing room in front of the bathroom. The door connected to the living room, and Mars put his ear to it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He could hear the sound of the shower and the faint sound of Hazuki's voice.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh-ahh-ahh&#9825; Coming, I'm coming!&#9825; My pussy feels so good, I'm cumming over thirty times! &#9825; Hiihnn! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">For real .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Would you normally masturbate in this situation?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">Even though I'm waiting for her to eat dinner together. .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It looks like Lilia was right. For the thirtieth time! I heard that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Thirty.....!? I-Is it bottomless, that pervert woman!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knows how she feels.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's more, it's fast. ...... I think she keeps coming, doesn't she? Lilia is like that too when you get turned on. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's not that bad,......, but it happens sometimes,......, and that pervert woman is really a pervert woman,.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;'d better warn her. I have a feeling she won't come out for a long time if we leave her alone, and the food will get cold.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knocked a little harder on the bathroom door.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">It's a little annoying when the dinner I've made gets cold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Dinner's ready! Stop masturbating and come out!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm not masturbating!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki shouted in a muffled voice, but Mars wouldn't believe her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I heard you say that for the thirtieth time! If you don't want to be called a pervert woman by me too, you'd better hurry up and come out!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-Wait a minute, please! &#8213;&#8213;Mmm! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You cum again!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm nyoot!&#9825; Auhhh&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">You can't roll your tongue. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Too lewd.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her quivering voice told of Hazuki's climax.</p>
<p class="calibre" style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm sorry ......, but I've been feeling really horny since yesterday. ...... It's because I saw Mars and Lilia-san mating, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't tell me you're trying to shift the blame here.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As soon as they arrived at the table, Hazuki, who was wearing Lilia's camisole that was too tight around her breasts and shorts that looked a little more plump than Lilia's, put herself on the shelf and said something ridiculous to them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Due to the loose chest, one of the shoulder straps was coming off and the contents were almost visible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Regardless of her size, Mars couldn't help but glance at her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her skin was not as white as Lilia's, but it was a healthy shade and really sensual.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't blame it on others. It's your own lecherous nature. &#8213;From today on, masturbation is forbidden. Not until you leave the dungeon and leave us. It's unsightly and dirty. Also, please don't touch things too much. It will smell like a pervert woman's love juice.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I can't! If I don't do it every day, I'll go crazy! &#8213;&#8213;I-it doesn't smell! It's just a little ...... salty!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're already crazy. I can't believe it. Are you licking your own stuff?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It's definitely crazy ......, but I can't speak for others either .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since meeting Lilia, Mars' sex drive has become unusually strong, and he has sought her out a tremendous number of times each and every day. Mars was not patient enough to laugh at Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the end, most of the food that he had cooked, which was more than he had expected, ended up in Hazuki's stomach. On the contrary, she even wanted a second helping.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps it was the exhaustion of masturbation, or perhaps it was the daytime dungeon search, but Hazuki had a huge appetite.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The way she squirmed and ate without saying a word was adorable, like a small animal, and Mars continued to feed her, even though he feared he might fatten her up someday. However, since there is a lot of unnecessary movement in every part of her body, she may be consuming more calories than Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After finishing her meal, Hazuki bowed deeply in thanks for the food. However, her head remained down and did not come back up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm full and I'm getting sleepy. ...... Can I go to bed first ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki murmured in a sleepy, absent-minded voice</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're too free! All three of your major needs are met!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm sorry ...... I've always had a weakness for cravings for some reason ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#8213;&#8213;Well, that's okay. ...... Good night. We're going to bed in a little while, just make sure you've got your covers with a futon and don't show your stomach.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good night. ...... Mars-san, you look like a mother. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rubbing her shabby eyes, Hazuki staggered off to the bedroom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was once again staring at her with an exasperated look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't know what to make of that. ...... Isn't that a bit rude?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's just that Lilia isn't like that. Isn't that what most kids around that age are like? Being brazen is what kids do.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That pervert woman is one year older than Mars, but ......? I guess I don't have much patience. I don't know how she can be a member of the Tomb Guard's clan.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars recalled that Hazuki had said something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only image he had of her was that of a pervert woman who completely loved to masturbate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are the Tomb Guard strict?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Elves are one thing, but isolated clans usually have strict precepts.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's tough. ...... I'm just an ordinary farmer, so I didn't have any precepts. Watch out for the cows, I guess. Lilia, I'm sorry, but can you help me clean up the dishes?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course. Except they're slaves or something, but they usually help out. Only a pervert woman wouldn't do it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After he finished washing the dishes, Mars also took a bath alone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The bathroom is huge, the bathtub alone is the size of an ordinary apartment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There's plenty of room for three people to take a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Maybe that's why he feels so lonely when he take a bath alone. Because of this, after meeting Lilia, he rarely went into the treasury except to replenish supplies.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever he's alone, he thinks of the past. He wonders if his current happiness is a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why he's a little afraid to go to sleep every day. That's why he clings to Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre" style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, Lilia, you're still awake?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, I am. Because I want to go to bed with Master. Besides, being alone with that pervert woman is ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he got out of the bath, he found Lilia lying on the dining table dozing off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He told her she could go to sleep first, but Lilia seemed to be waiting for him politely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia lifted her face from the desk, her eyes dim.<br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You looked sleepy. Shall we sleep normally today? You're tired, aren't you? Good work today. I know you're even more sleepy now that you've loosened up.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, ......please let me at least serve you. It's hard to keep it all in, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you say it's hard, it's hard, but ...... As expected, the dungeon is more important. I'll be patient. I can't let Lilia get tired. Let's get some sleep.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A cool-headed Mars thinks that he should sleep to regain his strength and be in perfect condition to take on the challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Having been reincarnated and having two lives, Mars is good at switching his thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he was using his head, he was his twenty-nine-year-old self, and when he wasn't, he was his seventeen-year-old self.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The upper limit of physical strength was different between Mars and Lilia. And Lilia is the type of person who doesn't speak even when she's tired.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars has a sex drive, but he can endure it. Worst case scenario, he can just handle it himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... If you don't feel refreshed, you'll be tempted by that pervert woman, yes?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia is jealous, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, I am. I can't help it if I think you might be taken away.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I like big tits. I especially like to bury my face in them. It's really soothing to be pampered by Lilia in that way. ...... Hazuki-chan is a cliff. And even without that, I'd still choose Lilia.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked relieved and then wet her lips with the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The action was so sexual that Mars was beginning to lose control of his mood.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then I'm going to give you a good tit-fucking today! You did very well during the day. It's because of Mars that we were able to reach this point without any dangerous battles, although that pervert woman doesn't seem to have noticed.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, really? I couldn't do it during the day, so I really wanted to ask you. &#8213;&#8213;You have to be very careful inside the dungeon. If we had to fight every single battle, we wouldn't have enough energy to make it to the lower layers. We're still fine because we have this &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;, but I'm sure Zerius and the others are in trouble. I don't think they're getting much rest.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars first conquered the dungeon, his biggest enemy was getting enough sleep and food.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This was because he was alone and had no one to guard him. There was no treasury at that time, so he had to carry a mountain of food on his back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars used a homemade alarm made of string and cans and set it up in the passageway to keep an eye out for monsters, and slept for about an hour at most.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius is not alone, but if this is the first time for all of them to attack the dungeon, the situation would be similar to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There are several other problems as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was to be expected that Zerius would get into fights with his tired friends over trivial things.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars understood that keeping stress at bay was more important than preparing his forces for dungeon attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In that sense, he could not deny Hazuki's method of refreshment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You don't have to ask me. All you have to do is give the order. I will do anything for you if it makes you happy. &#8213;&#8213;It's bad enough that he's a little worm and he's sticking out like a sore thumb. I don't think he's still alive. It's practically suicide.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think he's just barely alive. With that kind of skill, he can handle most things. Unless he's near the bottom.. &#8213;&#8213;I didn't tell you this because I'm not into scaring people, but there is a boss at the bottom layer. This is something you might not be aware of. If you meet the boss and survive, you can conquer the dungeon. In other words, dead men tell no tales.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Boss?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars remembered what had happened in &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The closer you get to the bottom layer, the stronger the monsters are.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon is basically a pyramid, and the lower you go, the wider the entire floor becomes, and only the strongest and biggest of the monsters remain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike in the game, movement between layers is possible even for monsters, so he had the feeling that it was a naturally occurring caste, not deliberately placed by someone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both demons and humans want to go to the place where they feel most comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A dungeon is like a poisoned urn, and only the strongest individuals survive in the lower layers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The strongest of them all is the boss.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The boss is the apex predator in the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. The one in &#12302;Ganymede&#12303; was a giant snake-like monster. It was sleeping in the middle of a huge hall, coiled up. It used magic and poisonous liquid to melt the walls, so it was pretty strong.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;H-How did you manage to win by yourself? How did Master defeat it? After all, as the name &#12302;Thunder&#12303; implies, were you using thunder magic?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What? With a regular sword, like I did to Treant earlier. I'm not very good at magic. I mean, I can only use a few of them.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;!? Then where did you get the name &#12302;Thunder&#12303;?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You'll know it when you see it. It might be hard for Lilia, so I'll tell you before I do it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-sure ...... Master is really mysterious&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's cool to have a secret or two, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It's hard to explain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because in the case of Mars, it was only because he was reincarnated that he realized it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The more people who live in this world normally, the less they realize.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And there is not enough time. By the time you realize it, your knowledge can't catch up anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a technique that he was able to do because he knew how to be efficient from birth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason the bases his thinking on his previous life in the modern world is so that he doesn't get lost in the crowd. Different values are valuable. The values of modern Japan, which are not of this world, can no longer be obtained once they are lost.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Moreover, it is very difficult to obtain knowledge and information from this world. He realized how convenient the Internet society was.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the poor farming village where Mars is from, you have to work voluntarily to get information. And by "voluntarily," he means by paying money.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In a world dominated by nobles, controlling the press is natural and books are difficult to get obtain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Despite the external factors, because Mars has not been tainted by the norms of this world, Mars retains his current power, which is so powerful that he can conquer dungeons by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the seventeen years since he was born, Mars has been refining his power most efficiently, a power that everyone in this world has mastered and thought they had already mastered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If it weren't for the knowledge of his previous life, he would have been reaching for various things just like any other human being.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I don't need any of God's reincarnation privileges.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I have this memory, it's more than enough to be a cheat.</span></p>
