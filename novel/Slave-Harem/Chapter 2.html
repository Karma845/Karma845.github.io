<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's not a problem to keep this bow, since you've taken the trouble to purchase it. In human society, there is a saying: "Elves don't choose their bows."&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was very proud of herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's like saying, "A good workman does not blame his tools". But don't you want a magic bow or something?&#12288;Magic weapons are awesome.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm giving it to the arrow on my own, so I think I'd like something a little lighter if I say it strongly, but ... My bowing technique is different from that of humans. So it's a little difficult to handle if it's heavy.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, you have big breast........I guess it would be best if you had something like a sideways-shooting bow.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia nodded, slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is shooting with the bow in her left hand lying horizontally. This is the way to shoot a horizontal bow.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her chest was in the way, making it impossible to shoot in the normal way. Even so, her hit rate was high, which he honestly thought was amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even if you want to buy one, magic weapons are expensive, so I can keep them like this for now. If you happen to get one, that's fine. Master's equipment is more important than that. Basically, the general trend seems to be that if it's for a slave, a hand-me-down will suffice. The value of life is different.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, that's fine with me. Besides, the value of life is the same for everyone. There is no higher or lower value. In fact, Lilia's life is higher in my opinion.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Most of Mars' original equipment, as well as the little money he had saved over the past seventeen years and some of his extra income from a year ago, were almost completely lost when he purchased Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars only had two cheap daggers. The daggers are not for fighting, but mainly for cutting food in daily life. In short, they are similar to knives that can be used for multiple purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What little money he had left after buying Lilia was used to pay for her clothes, accessories, lodging, and meals, so Mars did not have enough money to call it an asset.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In his previous life, he died without spending any of the money he had saved, and since his rebirth in this world, he has been a bit ephemeral.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The life that Mars wants is a mild Yankee-like one. This is 180 degrees opposite of his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He wants to get married early, have children, build a house, and play with his friends on holidays.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In his previous life, Mars treated them like horses and fools, <span style="font-style: italic;">but now that I think about it, that seems to be the ideal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;Saving money is meaningless when you die.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knows this firsthand, so he doesn't care that much about savings. He was also not that interested in money by nature.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ever since I met Mars, I feel like I'm learning to be too extravagant.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's okay. Happy and joyful are important things in life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason why Mars allows Lilia to be as extravagant as she wants to be is because there is nothing to buy even if you have money in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In this world, where technology is still not advanced, there are no cars. In other words, there are few luxury cars or other symbols of wealth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The quality of food is not high, but Lilia, who has no other standard of taste than the one she has in this world, is satisfied enough to eat as much as she wants. She is also working very hard to learn how to cook, buying recipes from restaurants at a high price.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Just looking at Lilia as she ate her delicious meal made him love her even more.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He can feel like he is watching his daughter, even though she is his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well.......I didn't know meat could be so delicious, though. I thought it was smelly.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, if you choose the right kind. The kind of meat that humans eat doesn't have much of an odor, so it looks like Lilia can eat it too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thought Lilia would be a vegetarian because of her race, but when he fed her meat, her reaction was surprisingly not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Now, we're almost at the entrance of the dungeon. I'm a little excited&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, who is not really interested in money, is more interested in things that can only be experienced in this world, such as magic. That's why his current preoccupation is with Lilia and dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only thing that makes him flourish in this tasteless world is Lilia's presence and his inquisitiveness for the unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;All right, let's go in. Don't leave me in the dungeon, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course ......, even if you ask me to leave, I won't. It's not that I'm afraid, okay? You know.&#12288;It's because I'm a slave.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although she said she wasn't afraid, Lilia gripped the sleeve of Mars' clothes tightly as she anxiously looked at the entrance to Sekhmet, a cave-shaped dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia does the same thing in places where there are many people. Even though she talks down to them, Lilia knows the fear of human beings better than anyone else. She had spent decades under the thumb of slavers, deprived of her freedom and dignity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knows very well that Lilia's spirit is not particularly strong, just because she is used to being strong and proud.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's okay to be scared because this is a dungeon that no one has been able to breakthrough in the twenty years since it was discovered. It's normal and natural to be scared. But with me, you'll be fine. Besides, we'll only be exploring the relatively safe lower layers today.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars laughs. It was a smile that spilled out involuntarily, not to make Lilia feel uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;And you know... why are you wearing those clothes? There are tons of them. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars stretches the bridge of his nose as he gazes up and down at Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is it strange,......? This is one of my favorite outfits that Master bought me. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia spun around, her face anxious to see how she liked it. She doesn't want Mars to think she's weird.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, no, no. It's super cute and adorable. Honestly, you look amazingly cute no matter what you're wearing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm embarrassed.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars doesn't have a lot of money, but he does have a lot of clothes for Lilia. This is because that is what Mars spent all of his remaining money on.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Most of them are fashionable clothes, but some of them are erotic outfits for nighttime sexual activities. Most of them are custom-made.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars mocked himself for thinking that this might be the place where he was making the most use of his cultural knowledge of modern Japan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is about to dive into a dungeon, and of all the clothes she has to choose from, she is wearing the most revealing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's like "A mountain licker licking a mountain", Mars thought calmly. <span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN sorry don't know how to translate this line &nbsp;山を舐なめている山ガールみたいだな&#12289;とマルスは少し冷静になる&#12290;]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He can see Lilia's white soft skin and erotic body in full view.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Just looking at her makes him horny. Mars can't help but remember the feel of her fine skin absorbing his fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her upper body looks like a bikini with just a little bit of transparent fabric added.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her cleavage is too deep, and Mars's eyes are drawn to it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She had a soft belly that he wanted to touch, and a cloth wrapped around her waist like a Chinese dress, but the slit was too deep and one of her thighs was fully exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After seeing the concave dent in her navel, Mars looks at the beginning of the slit at her waist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's the kind of place where part of her panties should be visible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Are you wearing panties? I can't see what should be there.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm wearing them. There was a kind of string, so I took that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, that, huh. That's my hobby, ...... that's not for everyday use. It's for nighttime. I had it made because I wanted to untie your string panties. &#8213;Isn't it too erotic? You'll get a lot of attention from guys in this.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Elves tend to dress like this in the forest, you know? It's a familiar look for me. It's easy to move around without restricting the movement of the joints.&#12301;<br /><br /></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CsVwc5d/00009.jpg" alt="00009" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">What an erotic race</span>, Mars thought admiringly. As much as he liked Lilia's appearance, he was sure that her fellow elf would also like her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'll be back tomorrow at noon, so we'll be spending the night in the dungeon today. Sorry, it's a bit of a dirty inn. The best rooms seem to be reserved for nobles, so I can't rent them.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's totally fine, but ...... is there an inn in the dungeon?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As she entered the dungeon, Lilia saw a variety of people moving around busily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The image Lilia had of a dungeon was very different from reality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She had imagined a cave-like place with demons walking around and human corpses lying all over the place. But the reality was the same as in the city. There were even stalls.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was convinced that the reason Mars was not nervous at all was because he knew this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've heard that you can find lodgings almost anywhere, as long as it's not a newly discovered dungeon or a place with a high level of difficulty. The first floor is usually guarded by mercenary soldiers and is also used to kill demons. Well, it's not completely safe, because sometimes demons come up from the lower layers.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Humans are really creatures that can make anywhere their own. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's expression becomes cloudy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars could understand Lilia's feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though the world has changed, human beings have not changed that much. Predictably, they will use the resources of the dungeon until it runs dry. This is the undreamed part of a dreamy world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So, what exactly do you do when you explore the lower layers?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We're going to dig through the walls and look for Magic Steels. When you think about it, that's the most efficient way to make money.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a borrowed pickaxe, the two of them dug into the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's not a task he really wants Lilia to do, but it's the only way to be efficient. The only other things they can do are things that involve risk, such as aiming to conquer dungeons or obtaining materials for rare and unusual demons. At the moment, there is no point in taking too many risks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What they're looking for is a black mineral called Magic Steel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It can be used to cast magic, and it can be used as a material for weapons and daily necessities. The largest is about the size of the palm of your hand.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The majority of the light in this world comes from the magical light provided by Magic Steel. The rest of the world uses fire in a primitive way, but the more urban you get, the less you see of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Magic Steel can be found outside of dungeons, but it is more efficient to look for it inside the dungeon. The purity is different. If you take it home and sell it, the cost performance was good considering its size and weight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They packed them into bags and carried them to a room in an inn built by cutting down a cave, then returned to the digging site and repeated the process.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Most of them are sold to merchants who have dived into the dungeon. The remainder would be brought back to the surface and sold to weapon and tool shops.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two of them mine while chatting leisurely. There were other adventurers doing the same thing, but the atmosphere between them was very relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As they mined, Mars looked at the bow on Lilia's back. The bow is a luxury item that he bought because he was told it was made by a master craftsman - enough to buy a luxury car in modern value - but he wishes he could have bought her something more suitable. Its color is dark and a bit plain looking as if the emphasis is on practicality. Lilia doesn't know that the bow she is carrying is so expensive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a bow, after all, for elves. I want to get a better one. I'm the type of person who wants to make sure that everyone at the party has the right equipment. I wonder if there are any national treasures for sale.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever he played a game in his previous life, he always made sure that he had the right level and equipment.<br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He would buy the most expensive equipment when he got to town, and if he couldn't, he would go back to raise his level and earn money.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a national treasure, so it won't be for sale. ...... &#8213;&#8213; Master is a mysterious person, aren't you? You don't know the obvious things that everyone knows, but you know things that aren't so obvious. You don't even know much about elves, yet you have such detailed knowledge. It's strange. It's not quite right, I guess.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked at him suspiciously.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Obviously, Mars doesn't know as much as the average person. Lilia has no idea how he came to be like that. Lilia thinks that human beings, no matter how much they are from the countryside, have a little more prejudice in the name of common sense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To be precise, Mars doesn't have the knowledge to make assumptions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars doesn't even know why the elves are an oppressed race, but he does know that they are good with bows.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah, ahh ....... How can I put it? I'll explain next time I get a chance. Simply put, I have a different way of gaining knowledge.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Because it's based on what I knew before I came to this world, .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The feeling that the knowledge of this world is added on top of the knowledge of modern Japan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knows that this is the reason why there is a discrepancy between him and reality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He knew about the characteristics of the elves, but that was from games and manga.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He didn't know much about the elves that existed in the new world in reality. In the first place, Lilia was the first person of a different race he had ever met.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Maybe that's why it doesn't feel real to him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he was living in this world, there was a sense in Mars that he was somehow looking at him from afar as if he were a stranger.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia had always wondered about Mars ever since she met him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It was as if only knowledge had descended on Mars from heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars has never revealed to anyone that he is a reincarnated person.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This world is not as safe as it was when he was in Japan. The value of life is so low that there are even such things as slaves, including Lilia. If you stand out too much, your life is in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why he didn't tell Lilia. If he's in danger of dying, there is a possibility that Lilia, who is with him, will also be in trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Mars wants to give to Lilia is a happy life without anxiety or worry. He wants to get rid of everything that could interfere with that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A man calls out to Mars, who is feeling this way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hey, you there! You're going into a dungeon with a demon, are you insane?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man's voice struck the ears of Mars and Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was approached by a man with silver hair parted in the middle, left and right.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man who approached Mars was in his early twenties, slender, tall, nasal, with a well-defined face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was dressed in white armor and had a long sword hanging from his waist. The sword is not very practical as a sword. If only for his appearance, he could be said to be the knight of the nobility.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars looks around and watches for demons. But there was no sign of the demon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">What's he talking about, this guy ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Is he hallucinating that I'm a demon?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hey! I'm talking to you, little bastard! Don't bring the demons here!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At the sound of the piercing voice, Mars finally realized that he was talking to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The silver-haired man was glaring at him sullenly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason Mars didn't realize he was being called out was that in his perception, he didn't have any demons with him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man was referring to the elf Lilia, the love of his life that Mars doted on and flirted with night after night.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The silver-haired man in white armor sneered not only at Lilia but also at Mars, who responded.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Behind him was a dark-haired girl and a couple of men who seemed to be his companions, and they looked at him with an air of annoyance at his haughty attitude. Mars could imagine that this kind of behavior was usual for the man.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The girl, who seemed to be a companion of the silver-haired man, had black hair that reached just above her shoulders and was wearing a red robe. She wore a red robe and the attire of a magician with a small staff. She was gorgeous and delicate, and she didn't look like the type of person who would be wielding a sword in battle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One of her bangs was long, and only her right eyes could be seen properly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first glance, the girl looked serious. He thought that she was going to be forced to be the class president or something. If she wants to run for office voluntarily, the library committee would be a good fit for her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her frowns and frightened expression gave Mars the impression that she was even more timid.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The girl shrugged her shoulders, held a small cane like a chopstick in both hands, and stood with her thighs slightly turned inward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was plain, but Mars could sense something shining in her. Mars was convinced that she was the type of girl who would suddenly become popular once she learned to wear makeup and lost her innocence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oi, why are you only looking at Hazuki!? I'm the one who's talking to you!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ze-Zerius, you can't act like that to someone you've never met. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Ignoring the shouting of the silver-haired man in white armor, Mars looked closely at the girl called Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Black hair is rare. Her face also looked vaguely Japanese, Mars thought.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he was first reincarnated, he was surprised to see a resident with hair color similar to that of a cosplayer, but after seeing it every day, he could only get used to it. After all, Mars' birth mother in this world had blue hair.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He wondered what kind of genetics she had since she had black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The girl looked to be about the same age or a little older than Mars, seventeen or eighteen. Mars has the perspective of a twenty-nine year old, so he is not very good at guessing the age of younger people. From an adult's point of view, junior high school and high school students generally look very young.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Underneath the girl's robe, she is dressed in light black.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars's eyes were on her white whiplash thighs, peeping through the pleated skirt above her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Her breasts are small, but her face is cute. Her face has an air of a young, dried-up loli, but she might actually be a little older than that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike Lilia, she is a girl who pretends all her eroticism is in her lower body. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;OI, don't ignore me! How can you ignore me at this distance!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm not interested in any man who talks to me</span>. Mars's gaze shoots straight through the woman alone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Irritated by a man who screamed even more because Mars didn't turn his face, Mars finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">What is he talking about?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I don't like his handsome face. I don't like him even more because he's handsome. ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars overreacted to the phenomenon of &#12302;Handsome men with women&#12303;, a phenomenon that exists in every world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Would you please stop taking demons into the dungeon with you? You might get stabbed in the back.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at the man who talks like a big shot, Mars says back with a blank face and a straight to point.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't have any demons with me.&#12288;Are you hallucinating?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Huuh? Don't make fun of me! There's no way a top-notch adventurer like me would be susceptible to illusionary magic! There are monsters here, isn't there? Right there.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man angrily pointed at Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia closed her mouth tightly and glared at the man.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were even a few tears in the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That expression on Lilia's face triggered a strong feeling of irritation in Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if he lived two lifetimes, he would never have the humanity to be so forgiving and tolerant as to remain silent when someone hurt Lilia, whom he loved more than anyone or anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia turned her head down to hide her tearful eyes and let out her frustration with the world in her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It's happening again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Why should I be oppressed by a lowly human being?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I myself have done nothing to be oppressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's heart fluttered with anger and sadness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is forcibly reminded of the fact that she is a persecuted person, a fact she forgets when she is with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The collar, which usually feels like a bond between her and Mars, is very heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She reminded herself that she was only a possession after all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Not only elves but also those who are called "subhuman" are targets of oppression.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are persecuted because of their human-like appearance and their ability to understand human language. They are persecuted because they have a strong sense of foreignness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are often referred to as demons. As for elves, there are other reasons why they are persecuted.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;All eyes around them were on Mars, the silver-haired man, and Lilia, and the silver-haired man took a step forward as if he had been waiting..</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars hid Lilia behind his back and focused all his attention on the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were many other aristocrats around, who seemed to value the dungeon adventurer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In order to appeal to them, the silver-haired man made an exaggerated gesture and announced himself. His high-pitched voice echoed loudly and was very annoying to the ears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My name is Zerius Laclair! One year ago, I was the &#12302;Thunder&#12303; who conquered the northern dungeon &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He raised his burly sword and showed the crowd the chattering blue electricity that flowed through his sword and body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He seemed to be visualizing static electricity and wrapping it around him, Mars thought.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The crowd was cheering and applauding the silver-haired man, Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's not much magic. It's classified as elementary magic, just enough to make you cloak yourself in electricity.&nbsp;Even so, it is understandable that the audience would think that he possesses more power than that if he shows off his achievements in conquering dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#12302;Thunder&#12303;, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;"I'm not talking about electricity or anything like that", said Mars, lightly scratching his head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Haah? Are you an idiot? There's no way this cute Lilia is a demon. You should buy some glasses before you go into the dungeon for real.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A-Are you trying to insult me!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You insulted me first, didn't you? Gelatin.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he knows his name is Zerius, he doesn't feel like calling him properly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My name is Zerius Laclair! I'm the &#12302;Thunder&#12303; who conquered &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;, you know!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I knew I might run into someone like this sooner or later, but I didn't expect to run into someone like this so soon. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Oh, really? That's great. Congratulations. But that's not the same thing as insulting Lilia. You should be bragging about it to your mother.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you some kind of pervert who lusts after demons? This is a masterpiece! I heard that kids in the countryside even lust for animals!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Covering his face with one hand, Zerius gave a high-pitched laugh. Mars felt the hairs on his body stand on end.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Malus shivered with anger, but on the other hand, his head was cool. Instead of the intuitive seventeen-year-old boy Mars, his twenty-nine year old personality began to think about the solution to this situation and the revenge against Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;....... I told you. Don't make fun of Lilia. And you, don't you think anything of it when you see such a good woman? I've given away all my money, and I don't regret a thing. I want to make more and more money.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good woman? You're kidding, right? What kind of person would be in heat with livestock?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;This second insult is no good.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars can't see Lilia's face behind him. It pains him to see her sad face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' actions were quick after he thought of retaliation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars hooked his foot and pushed Zerius' chest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's a move similar to the "Small Outer Reap" in judo. Mars doesn't want to make Zerius take the passive position, so Mars doesn't grab Zerius arms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This move was so fleeting that the people around them could barely follow it with their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">Thud</span>, he fell on his buttocks, and Zerius fell down with a disgraceful cry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Gughh! ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Look. You can get hurt if you have bad eyesight, right? You should go home. I don't want to hear a man panting.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a chuckle from the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To the casual observer, the man who had been pretending to be a hero had been easily defeated by a boy dressed like any other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he realized that he had been knocked down, he looked back at the mud on his armor's palm many times, and when he recognized the reality, he trembled, but his pale face turned red and his anger was revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you okay!? Zerius!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black-haired girl who was accompanying him approached Zerius and woke him up with a worried look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Somehow, the girl seems to have a special relationship with Zerius. The distance between them is a little different from that of friends.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Shut up! Go away, you useless piece of trash!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As if to discourage the girl's kindness, Zerius brushed her off roughly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The speed at which he swung his arm was without any consideration for his opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius' backhanded fist strike struck the girl in the face with <span style="font-style: italic;">bam,&nbsp;</span>and&nbsp;then there was a dull thumping sound of flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since his entire body was wrapped in metal armor, even the tips of his hands, the impact the girl received was equivalent to being hit in the face with a metal bat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ughh.......It hurts, it hurts.......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A few meters away, the girl blew up and fell to the ground on her buttocks, blood flowing from her nose, tears streaming down her face, and she wiped it with the sleeve of her clothes. The amount of nosebleed flowing out was so profuse that it could no longer be called a nosebleed, and Mars was seriously worried that the bones in her nose might have been broken.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She could have started crying out loud, but she struggled to hold her mouth and keep her voice down. She knows that if she lets out her voice, she'll be hit even harder, again and again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;OI you! What are you doing to your friends!? She's a girl, you know!? That girl was just worried about you, she didn't do anything!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars approached the girl who had fallen to the ground and was busy bleeding and handed her a handkerchief. He wanted to cast a healing spell on her, but unfortunately, there were only a few kinds of magic that Mars could use, and healing was not one of them.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/h1X5fC5/00010.jpg" alt="00010" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;This was a situation that even Mars had not expected. He had not expected Zerius to raise his hand to his companion, let alone to a woman's face. Guilt washed over Mars because he was the one who had caused it, even if not directly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm fine.......It-it's the same as usual, and I can use healing magic, pain, and dulling magic. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm sorry ...... it's my fault.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The girl stood up with a sluggish gait, smiled a little at Mars, and then applied a healing spell to herself. If you're looking at it closely, Mars will notice that there are a few blue bruises on her legs and other parts of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He can imagine the girl being violated daily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was sad to see the girl's smile forcibly made with her bloodied face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If she were my slave, I wouldn't treat her like this. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She could have a life of fun and play and eat beautiful tasty food every day. He would never hit her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And if she is his slave, his property, she is safe. It was a little irregular this time, but normally this wouldn't happen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason why Lilia, the persecuted elf, can not turn against humans, although he does not know why is because the collar makes it obvious at once that Lilia is the property of Mars. It was an unfortunate coincidence that Zerius tangled with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will never forgive you. ......! I'm not going to let you humiliate me like this. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius didn't really believe that anyone would be so rude to a dungeon adventurer's dream, a Treader.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He thought he was someone to be respected, someone to be envied and looked up to.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This time, too, he thought that the other side would apologize and bow. However, the reality was the exact opposite of what he had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had been mocked for Lilia, whom he cherished more than anything else. Whoever it was, he would not just let it go.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, if you're going to pick a fight, choose your opponent. Your standards are none of my business. &#8213;&#8213;Don't make fun of Lilia. And you owe her a serious apology. It's not nice to raise your hand to a girl.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Remember this! The inside of this dungeon is my garden! I'll make you rusty with this sword!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's a phrase I've heard a lot, but make sure you maintain it. You're not a good swordsman if you let your sword rust.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars makes fun of him for it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It-It's a metaphor! You know that!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I know, I'm just making fun of you&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kkhh......I'm going to make you regret this. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then don't worry. I've already regretted getting mixed up in all that hassle.&#12301;<br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He waved to Xerius and his group as they left, looking at Mars, and Mars sighed quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The girl who walked behind Zerius a little later looked terribly sad. If she came to Mars, he could protect her. But that's up to her to decide. If she wants to, he doesn't mind at all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master is much stronger than I imagined. ......? That human is a dungeon treader, overwhelmingly powerful, isn't he?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's not really about strength, because what I just used to defeat him is like a technique. And it can only be used once. So I can't use it against him anymore. Besides, I think he's pretty strong if he fights properly. He might even be good enough to call himself a Treader.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm not sure. But you defeated him easily, didn't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The premise was that the guy didn't want to fight. He just wanted to make a fool of someone and get a mount. That's why he had so many gaps. I don't think he had any idea that there were adventurers who would attack him. So it was inevitable that he ended up like that. &#8213;&#8213;But still, I'm sorry for what I did to that girl. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Malus was just poking fun at Zerius' falsehood.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason Mars can't use this technique a second time is because next time Zerius'll be on the lookout for an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;You can't do the same thing to a seasoned opponent anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars may have underestimated Xerius Laclair as a person, but he did not underestimate his fighting skills.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From Mars's point of view, Zerius seemed to be the strongest person in the place. &#8213;&#8213;Except for one.</p>
<hr />
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia had always thought that Mars, a boy who seemed cheerful and a bit good-natured, actually had a lot to hide.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia has always had a lot of questions about Mars since she first met him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason why Lilia doesn't ask him about them is because she owes him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She doesn't want to offend him. Besides, Lilia has her own secrets as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, let's just take it easy. I felt sorry for that girl, though. I'm sure their goal is to conquer, right? I don't think we'll be battling each other again since we'll be making money on the lower layers. The purpose of my dungeon exploration is to get money to play with Lilia.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There are many things I don't understand, but &#8213; thank you very much. You were angry for me, weren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, I did. I can't let him do that. You know, I love Lilia more than you know. I love you. That's why I won't tolerate anyone who makes fun of you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master is strange. ...... But I'm happy. I never thought that liking humans would be a thing in my life. I love you too, &#8213;&#8213;Mars.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia smiled and grabbed Mars' arm, squeezing his arm between her large breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' mouth loosened at the chunky, cool lump.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the other hand, Lilia's mouth was pouting as she looked down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'll protect you. I'm sure that's what my power is for.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master's power ...... is there anything, after all? You can afford it, can't you? You did just now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't want to brag like he does, so I'll show you my skills in person. They say that a really good sword is always in the sheath&#8213;&#8213;Let's capture the dungeon. It's just a trial run for today, so we won't be able to conquer it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course! I'll accompany you wherever you go!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Stretching a little, Lilia kissed Mars on the cheek, her heart trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm really glad that Mars bought me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I didn't expect to meet anyone in my life who would be angry with me for my sake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is invincible now that she has the most important thing. Since meeting Mars, she has laughed more than she has laughed in her entire life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Their slow dungeon-crawling life together begins.</p>
