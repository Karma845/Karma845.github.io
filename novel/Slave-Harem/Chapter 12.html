<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If we have sex, I can't go back to the way I was before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm sorry, Zerius.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">But I don't care anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good. You can both come out now. No sign of the monster.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After a long break, the three of them come out from inside the &#12304;Treasury House of Dreams&#12305;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was the first to emerge. To check the safety of the surroundings, they are in order of combat ability.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Amazing...... there aren't many magics that are as useful as this one in capturing dungeons...... and you can pack the treasure of the dungeon as well.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We didn't have a problem with that. There is a place between the treasures in the dungeon where the whole treasure can go out. So the way to go home is super easy.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a warp zone-like area between the treasures of &#12302;Ganymede&#12303; that Mars conquered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon is friendly to the conqueror, although it tries to kill you until you conquer it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon is like Lilia, Mars thinks. If you let yourself go, you're still not good(?).</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The three of them proceed through the dungeon as they did the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I wonder how long it will take us to catch up with Zerius and the others.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars spoke up without a second thought, just as if he was trying to start a conversation. However, an unexpected answer came from Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;As far as I have observed, Zerius's stride, his companions' movement speed, strength, originally planned rest time and fatigue ......, the structure inside the dungeon, the traps, the distance and time they walked ......, if we organize the situation at the moment, there is a good chance that we can catch up with him within half a day if there are no obstacles!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert woman?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki suddenly, as if a person has changed, starts talking about the elements she has seen and heard so far.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then she continued her explanation, making a gesture as if she were writing something on the ground with her finger.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The number of steps I walked today and yesterday was around 150,000 steps. ...... I was careful to avoid traps, so at 30 centimeters per step, I walked a little over 50 kilometers. 30 dead monsters were confirmed. If it takes five minutes to kill one, Zerius stopped for two and a half hours. If we had encountered them at the same pace after that,......, it would have taken us less than a minute on average,......&#8213;&#8213;I still wonder if we will catch up in another half day. Even if we are a little off from the mark, it will take less than a day to meet up with the others.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;What? Hazuki-chan you're not stupid?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I thought she was no good. No, she's no good for a no good. After all, the reason for the calculation is because she wants to have sex as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;E-even though you're a pervert woman......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a straight face, Hazuki looks at them both and wonders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Um, ......? Did I say something strange ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Somehow, you were mumbling about numbers or something?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah,......I've always been good at arithmetic, and I can calculate to a certain extent if I have the information,...... Well, that's how it is. I got a bunch of numbers in my head.......Should I have mentioned detailed numbers or something? I'm not very good at explaining things. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a slightly bashful smile, Hazuki looked embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Science girl, huh? ...... I mean, why are you embarrassed there?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;This girl..........There's a lot more to that!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki said that in another half day, it seems probable that they will catch up with Zerius and his party.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In addition, Hazuki says that this is just a calculation based on the information available at this stage, so it may not necessarily go according to this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is too much-undetermined information, so it seems impossible to make an accurate calculation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, it is uncertain whether Zerius and the others are even alive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia walk along, looking at Hazuki with faces that are not quite explaining themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Haah,...... I like you Mars-sama,...... I never thought it would feel so good to be touched by a man. ...... I guess when your body feels good, your mind likes it too. I can't stop loving it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I agree with that in itself. Because I feel very safe when I am wrapped in the warmth of the Master's body.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's attitude toward Hazuki seemed to have softened, if not heartened.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder if the fact that her parents are not around had an effect on Lilia. I didn't ask her about it, but I guess Lilia was also alone in her whole life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you can like it with just fingers, it must be amazing when it comes to sex, right? Lilia was melting earlier too. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It will be. I can assure you. The moment of climax, for example, is so moving that you are convinced you were born for this. Perhaps the desire to be dominated by a strong male is at the root of this desire.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">Oooh,</span> Hazuki applauds and starts excitedly in the dungeon where monsters roam.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sex, sex, sex! Sex with Mars-sama! I'm looking forward to it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Are you aware that it is a sexual act? Good grief ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Because other people wouldn't understand these words if they heard them, would they? I kind of like this word sex. ...... uuff!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia silently punches Hazuki, who laughs strangely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">The two of them are saying embarrassing things .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars looks forward and doesn't say anything, but blushes at the exchange between the two behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After making Hazuki cum several times and knocking her unconscious, Mars turned all his desire on Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The rushing worked for him, and Mars, fully aroused by Hazuki's caresses and Hazuki's response, continued to hammer his pent-up lust deep inside Lilia without once leaving her vagina.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When they were done, the three of them slept side by side, woke up, ate, groomed themselves, and came out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After about half a day of this, the incident occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sex! Sex with Mars-sama&#8213;&#8213;aah! Another trap! Why am I the only one who triggers the trap!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">Click</span>, an unpleasant sound echoed in the ears of the three, and Hazuki came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki felt something under her feet hit a switch, and she half-stepped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If she moved her feet, something must have triggered the trap.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That one, I think, Hazuki-chan was too careless. Come fly over here. I'll take care of the trap.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Because you're crazy about sex this, sex that, ...... you should experience the fear of dungeons with your whole body for once&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars urges Hazuki, who is unable to move an inch, to fly toward him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since this kind of thing has been repeated several times, neither Mars nor Lilia reacted so loudly when Hazuki was caught in a trap.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you wants me to die!? I don't want to die a virgin!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's okay. That type of thing is usually arrows or logs. I can stop that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I got it ......Eyy!&#12300;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars catches a Hazuki flying toward him and hands her to Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Immediately after that, several arrows fly from the wall, and Mars cuts them off with his sword and knocks them away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was surprised at the brilliant sequence of moves, but Lilia had an idea of the magic that Mars had mastered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is the most basic of magic, and most people stop looking at it as soon as they learn it, thinking they have mastered it completely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia. I got some new arrows.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've already got a full quiver of arrows. ...... Aren't you picking up too much? You have the wealth of a millionaire, but you are poor Master.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then I'll put it in the treasury. It's pretty expensive to buy arrows too. I'm grateful to be able to replenish it this way.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Only the Master supplies himself with traps. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">it's pretty common in the game. Supplied by an infinite bow and arrow trap.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sometimes Hazuki gets trapped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia recognizes the trap itself, and Mars is unfazed if he gets caught in a trap.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Only Hazuki lacks the skill in that area.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And above all, Hazuki is too careless. She is walking around at random, mouthing lewd words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm really glad I came here with Mars-san&#8213;&#8213;Mars-sama,......I would have died several times already if I had been with Zerius and the others,.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki looks relieved as she grabs Lilia's chest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars advises Hazuki as he watches Hazuki being angered by Lilia's displeasure at her touching of Lilia's breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-chan is too interested in sex. It would be helpful if you would at least be a little quieter. There are even monsters that Zerius ignored.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Compared to the beginning, the number of monsters has increased and the number of monster corpses has obviously decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It can be seen that Zerius' group stopped fighting and started ignoring them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To Mars' surprise, the number of carcasses of monsters decreased but did not disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This means that at least one of Zerius' group is still alive and is still attacking the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The three of them were working together to defeat the monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The monsters were getting bigger and stronger, so much so that they could see that they had reached quite a lower layer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Hazuki's flame magic was powerful in its own way, and most of those who were hit by it soon became fireballs and died. Lilia's bow and arrow were also useful for preemptive attacks, and in some cases were so practical that they could slip past the monsters by themselves. Lilia was really strong, and not just in words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki seemed to have confidence in her stamina because she ate a lot, and on top of that, she had a lot of total magical power. Lilia had said before that Hazuki would be a powerful magician, and it was true.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I-I feel guilty......I wanted to be with Mars-sama, and it was as if I had betrayed Zerius, so if I didn't say something about sex, that's all I'd think about. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'm surprised! Do you feel guilty about that!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was a bit surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was pretty outspoken against Zerius, and Mars thought she was justifying her betrayal with the humiliation and pain she had suffered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wha! What do you think I am!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert woman&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert woman, it is&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm a pervert, but ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki said through clenched teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She finally admitted it......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Congratulations, pervert woman. Life begins when you admit it to yourself.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Clap-clap-clap</span>, Lilia was clapping, but her face is the exact opposite, a look of complete contempt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Admit it yourself .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If I could do that, I wouldn't have any trouble,</span> he thought, and then a dark hole appeared in Mars' vision.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The path to the lower layers.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Zerius is making a lot of progress. ...... I'm starting to get a little scared. Y-you're going to protect me, right? I'm sure Zerius will definitely get angry&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. I'm not gonna let that guy do what he wants. That's why I made you my property, my slave.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Pat-pat</span>, Mars gently touches Hazuki's head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmm......Mars-sama, you are so kind......&#8213;&#8213;I-I'm starting to get wet......I-I got these pants today......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert. &#8213;&#8213;Should I be gentle at first?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh!? I-Isn't it normal to be gentle to a girl for her first time!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's what I did with Lilia, but I thought Hazuk-chan would prefer it if I were more intense.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a certain intensity in the second half when he was fingering her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But despite being a virgin, Hazuki was moaning loudly like a beast.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'll leave it to you. ...... I'd be happy if it's made me feel good. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe it's good to be intense ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;My fingers didn't hurt at all and ...... it felt good.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki has no idea how many times she has come just with his fingers. There was no time to count.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Anyway, we need to attack the dungeon first. If we die, we'll lose everything.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;D-don't say scary things! I'm even more susceptible to traps!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You should be more aware of your surroundings while walking.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The three of them descend the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The end of the dungeon is near.</p>
<div class="start-9em">
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was fully wounded.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius' party was reduced in number, and there were only three of them left, including Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The other members of the party were unable to move due to injuries sustained from the trap and the fight with the monsters, and Zerius mercilessly left them there and moved on.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No one was unharmed any longer. Even Zerius, the most capable of the three, is covered in wounds everywhere. Depending on the physical strength of the monsters, even those wearing armor would take damage.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Damn, damn, damn it! How could things go so wrong!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Zerius, Fred died because you were reckless!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The leader of the men hired by Zerius approached him in tears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though death is, in a sense, part of the deal, losing one's friends in real life naturally makes one angry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And even more so because it was the result of an impossible march. His own exhaustion also affects his frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Shut up! You didn't tell me he was such a weakling! I made the mistake of taking you at your word that he was strong!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Anyone who wanders around dangerous dungeons without a break will end up like that!&#12288;That's why I warned you so many times!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They had been walking for more than a day with less than an hour's rest for food and sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The vastness of the dungeon felt tremendous, and consumables such as water, recovery supplies, and arrows were rapidly depleting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was also a lot of food that had been lost during the battle with the monsters. And they had not anticipated the possibility of this happening.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike Mars and his party, Zerius and his party were wearing armor that weighed around 15 kilograms when fully equipped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They also carried water and other necessities on their backs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In total, each of them weighed around 40 kilograms. And yet, they were moving at the same or faster speed than Mars and his party.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was much faster than the speed at which dungeon adventurers normally travel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and his party, who had a treasury, carried nothing but the bare necessities. They are also light in clothing. Hazuki was carrying nothing but a walking stick and a small bottle of water.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The burden of doing the same thing is too much. However, it is Zerius and the others who are doing the usual dungeon crawling. Mars and the others are the exceptions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No matter how many traps they unlocked, there were still many more, and they had to fight a series of battles with powerful types of monsters that they had never seen on the ground. Moreover, the dungeon is the home ground of monsters. Even familiar monsters are more powerful than those on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike the monsters, since the surroundings are completely away from them, their spirits are worn out and they are close to their physical limits just by walking with caution.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Except for the surviving leader, the other members of the party did not speak a word and walked with their eyes looking down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In direct contrast to Mars and the others, who were moving forward cheerfully and happily, there was almost no conversation at all. If there is an occasional conversation, it is usually in the form of abuse, complaints, or pessimistic words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The never-ending adventure is taking a toll on their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The distance is too great to even try to return. It is doubtful that they will even make it back safely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The best course of action is to continue on and conquer the dungeon. The only thing left to do is to hope that there are no obstacles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But even that seems difficult. Since there was no luggage belonging to the missing companions, there was a possibility that, in the worst case, they would starve to death. Many monsters cannot become food for humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;All of them regretted it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They should have let Hazuki make calculations based on the information obtained in the dungeon as originally planned and requested the necessary personnel and supplies from the nobles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even so, the reason they broke into the lower layers was a result of their attempt to make the most of the charisma that the name &#12302;Thunder&#12303; brought.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A talented person who was taking on the challenge of breaking through for the second time. The reward would be great if they could breakthrough with the fewest number of people. <span style="font-style: italic;">I was taken for a ride after being told such a thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In fact, Zerius was strong.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why he created this situation. He had given them hope that they could go.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius was not able to walk in step with everyone else, and he was accompanying his companions because he was still able to go.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius, too, was mentally weakened from exhaustion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was paranoid that a real &#12302;Thunder&#12303; was coming up behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The &#12302;Thunder&#12303; inside Zerius was powerful, as big as a mountain, and cruel in nature.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems more fearsome than any other monster he has ever encountered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Quickly,&nbsp;I must conquer this dungeon quickly, and get the strongest magic from the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;. If I don't, I will be killed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, Zerius was aiming for money and status, but the danger to his life that he felt several times was changing his purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The horror of the dungeon enlarged the &#12302;Thunder&#12303; in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">A competent person who can conquer such a terrifying place. And he does not boast about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is to say, he was able to do it with ease. For &#12302;Thunder&#12303;, it was nothing to be proud of.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In reality, even Mars, who had conquered the place by himself, had to work very hard, but Zerius did not know that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Shut up ......! Think of it as a share of your friends dying and you getting a bigger share!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Our share ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's right. If there was one less person, then the amount would float. I don't know the total amount of treasure in the dungeon, but it should be enough to live off of and even more. Besides, it's almost over. The monsters are getting stronger, but their numbers are decreasing. Even the monsters in the dungeon are not infinite. If the number is becoming a quality, it means the end is near.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Wait, by any chance, but isn't there a pinnacle of that quality ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The leader imagines unpleasant things from Zerius' words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius had considered this possibility from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As he descended the dungeon, he saw a change in the type of monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, they were weak, like herbivores, and then a chain of predator-like ones.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a clear division between the eaters and the eaten at each level of the layer.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the layer where Zerius is now, lion-like monsters were walking in herds, though their overall number was small, and in the previous layer were bull-like monsters that were larger in size than the herd.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next layer must have monsters stronger than lions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If this trend continues, it is highly likely that there will eventually be something stronger than all the monsters inside the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Probably. To step through a dungeon, you have to become the most powerful person in this world of dungeons. &#8213;&#8213;I can be the strongest person in this world.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you've got to be kidding me! We are all nearing our physical and magical limits! At least we should rest somewhere!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Where? It would be the same anywhere. If we fall asleep, we will be fed to the monsters as it is. &#8213;&#8213;This is the place where life is held&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I can't be anything if I don't become something real.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm not going to live a miserable life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;At least if there's Hazuki around ......! Why did you leave her! She was supposed to be the one doing the magical combat and sustenance and fodder calculations! She's your woman, isn't she!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It would have been the same if we had brought her. She would have died out there anyway. Women are only good for a man's sexual gratification or as a shield. It doesn't matter. If you follow me well, I'll love you&#12301;`</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He just left a useless tool behind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius' perception of Hazuki is close to that of an object, and he doesn't think it's important.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's about all the emotion Zerius has.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he had them, he might be able to use them a little, but if he didn't, his share of the dungeon's treasure would increase.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He has exclusivity as a tool, but not affection.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's choice of Mars was the right one.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Can you see that?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh ...... what the heck. Isn't it big for the path ...... to the lower layer?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius' party encounters a huge staircase.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The air is similar to that of the descent to the lower layer, but the size is a step apart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The path used to be wide enough for two people to stand side by side, but the one they found now is wide enough for ten people to stand side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The bottom ...... It's the bottom layer! I read that in a book once! The bottom layer is the biggest floor in the dungeon, and it's supposed to be big and spread out with no walls!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The leader certainly felt uncomfortable with a head that was foggy from fatigue, pain, and malnutrition.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">You read it in a book? Not seen it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Conquer the dungeon.......Did you do it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Contrary to the buoyant Zerius, the leader does not accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Considering the past, it was not unreasonable to think that it must be some kind of trap.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's go! Hahaha! Now we're rich!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius, his white armor stained, forgets his fatigue and runs off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He does not yet know that what follows is the toughest part.</p>
