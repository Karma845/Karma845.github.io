<h3>Bonus Story</h3>

<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I honestly think he is a strange human.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man who walks happily ahead of the slaves without chains on her collars - Mars Irving.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A man who easily paid an unbelievably large sum of money to buy me, Lilia Silvestri, an elf, in other words, a 'Master'.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Elven slaves are, on average, more expensive than their human counterparts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason for this is that their life expectancy is very different from that of humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Considering the human lifespan, four or five generations of the same elf can be a servant, so I heard that many of my people have been treated in the same way ever since they were bought.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;I don't like to follow a human, and every time I have been about to be bought, I have deliberately been rude and refused to buy, but why I was willing to follow this man alone, ...... I don't know either.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's just that Mars' eyes looked lonely on a moonlit night, and I was strangely curious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Besides, even in the worst-case scenario, Mars' life would be over if he endured for fifty years or so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even in the time, it takes for a single wrinkle to appear on my face, this man will not be able to live.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nevertheless, the only thing I have learned since we started being together is that I have no idea what this man is thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, what do you want to eat today? That restaurant over there wasn't great for the price. I mean, it's just a fancy shop.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Why don't you decide, &#12302;Master&#12303;? And it's not polite for a human being to call me by my name so casually.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I almost sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This man Mars, for some reason, makes me feel extravagant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's a luxury, but in some ways, it's scarier than being treated like a slave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason I'm afraid is because I don't know what he really means. It's too creepy. Why does he happily waste money like this?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unintended kindness is like a blade held to the throat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Let me eat in restaurants where humans, and aristocrats for that matter, go or relentlessly try to buy me clothes that cost more than a mere piece of cloth. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even the lodgings are all upmarket places. Moreover, they are all first-class establishments with employees trained to behave in the same way as human aristocrats, even when dealing with alien species who are ostracised by humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Naturally, the prices are correspondingly high.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The source of the funds is a mystery, and first of all, it is difficult to understand the thought of giving slaves a luxury.</p>

<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I will not be bonded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;W-well, it's fun in its own way, the food is good and the living conditions are comfortable, but .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, this human is a little different from the others, but still, from my perspective as an elf, he is a member of the human race, which is in the end, my enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If I am nice to them and let my guard down, the last thing they want to do is to make me despair somewhere else, which is probably their hobby.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why I treat them coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because the humans of this world would not normally be kind to a different race, even an elf.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It would be safer for them to hit you suddenly on meeting you.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I will not be bonded!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What should I call you then?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... I'll leave it to you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So no names, that's too unreasonable. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a face that can only be described as guarded and open, Mars scratches his head and makes a troubled gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I've heard that he is an adventurer who aims to conquer dungeons, but with this mild, no-nonsense air, I doubt if he can even master the sword hanging at his waist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you don't like my attitude, why don't you activate the slave crest? 'Though I still won't give in to my heart.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, I won't use slave crests. I would never treat Lilia carelessly.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars stares at me with eyes that have a strange intensity, eyes that make me feel strange when I stare at them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dark light shimmering in the depths of his eyes made me terribly upset.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh, ah, um ...... t-thank you, very much .......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;I-I was a bit surprised. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is a man who often smiles and laughs, but sometimes he looks very serious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The gap between the two is something ...... that makes my heart hot and my whole body on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I resent being born an elf a little, only that it is immediately noticeable and obvious when my ears turn red.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Why does my body react to this man's words?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's as if ...... I'm in love with this human......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No, that is definitely not the case!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I understand ...... I give you permission to call me by name!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Great. So, what sort of food do you want to eat? Meat? Fish?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, who has returned to his usual face, continues to ask about dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I decided to ask nicely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Why do you ask my opinion? A slave is a tool to be used at every turn, isn't it? As long as life can be maintained at a minimum, that's good enough for human beings.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I saw Lilia as a human &#8213;&#8213; well, you don't seem to be a human, but ...... as an individual anyway. So I'll take care of you as a matter of course. Besides, I thought it would be fun, like a date.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Deeto? What does the word mean? Never heard of it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sometimes I don't understand what Mars means by the words he says.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Of course, there are words that even I, a long-lived elf, don't know, but I feel there is a fundamental difference between them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What other way to say a date is ...... lover's meeting?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wha ......!? We're not in that kind of relationship, you know?!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What all of a sudden!?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I can't help but hear his voice turn inside out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars blushed with embarrassment and said.<br /></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Could it be that they are being treated this well out of kindness!?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;A human against an elf!?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What, you didn't notice? ...... I thought I was appealing to you there, but ...... I knew it, I'm still not used to it. I guess you have to say it directly instead of only acting it, these things.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-no, I'm not saying that I don't agree with that, ......, but those things should be with your own people, shouldn't they? As an inbred species, even if the offspring itself is desirable, humans should only mingle with humans and elves with elves.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's a strange feeling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;For some reason I don't feel bad, even though, according to my values, I would have absolutely loathed any kind of favor from a human. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;What is this itchy, fidgety feeling?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;You're not a little human girl, Lilia, you shouldn't easily fall in love with him!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I don't want a human or an elf, I want you, Lilia.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-s-stop it! What are you saying!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though we're in the middle of a crowd, Mars gently takes my hand with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I shouldn't think anything of what humans think of me, but I instantly became aware of the gazes of those around me.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There's no way I should be showing favoritism in such traffic!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was love at first sight. From the first time I saw you, I knew you were the only one for me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-stop, d-don't look at me, you humans!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lukewarm stares of the humans hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I'm not a spectacle, but I'm like a performer in a funny play.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I could tell by the heat in my whole body that my face, not just my ears, had turned red.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I shake off Mars's hand and cover my ears with my hands, and I cower to hide my face as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's the height of humiliation to have my mind so disturbed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-Sorry, for saying that suddenly? But I wanted you to know how I feel.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's really sudden ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Let's think calmly and dispassionately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What is there in this man that makes me fall in love with him?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It may be calculated, but the factors that make us like each other are important.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;By listing them, I may be able to name my current feelings.&#12288;First of all, this man, Mars Irving, bought me from a slaver and cares for me. There was no doubt about that, it was a fact.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;It had been eerie so far, but if it was out of goodwill, I had no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars buys me clothes that don't make me cold, feeds me food I've never eaten or seen before, and even gives me solid alone time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if sleeping in bed with a human man is a little uncomfortable, the warm, soft feel of the bed instantly lulls me to sleep, and I'm not even that bothered anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I even found myself beginning to feel comfortable with the temperature of someone else next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And Mars doesn't scream loudly or get violent, so I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a moment when I felt calm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His personality is ...... kind. This would be objectively true.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is not afraid to give charity to strangers if they have the air of being in need.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is not that I do not feel sarcastic as if he is closing the distance from above as a person who has it, but it can be said that it is kind to be able to give charity in a situation where there is nothing to be gained by being merciful.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is not afraid of me as an elf, he does not exclude me, and he is kind to me.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is a little bit smug, but it is better than being angry or overbearing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And this man, for some reason, is a good cook.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' fondness for me is questionable in itself, but I can judge that he is not a jerk on the inside. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the outside, for example, his face, well, maybe I don't dislike him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's reasonably well-defined, a little bit pretty, and also masculine.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As for his body, he is ...... reasonably tall, looks slender, and has good muscles. Rather, he is stockier than I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I think he looks thin simply because he has less fat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Overall, he is quite nicely proportioned and I honestly don't dislike him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He also has considerable financial resources, so there is nothing to worry about in terms of his lifestyle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The elves are originally long-lived, so few of them are attached to money, which is of ever-changing value, and they are usually self-sufficient in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Overall, from a variety of factors, I don't mind being with Mars. After all, there is nothing to dislike.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rather, ...... huh?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Could this be that I like it ......?</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213; No, no, this is different!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I'm not used to being treated kindly, so I'm losing my mind!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia? Are you alright? Is there something wrong!? Damn it, I can't use &#12302;Healing&#12303; ......!&#12288;Wait here, I'll get someone who can use &#12302;Healing&#12303; right away!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-no, I'm not sick! Elves rarely get ill in the first place!&#12288;Above all, I can use &#12302;Healing&#12303; myself!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-Is that so.......But your face is still all red, you know? Do you have a fever ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I get angry at Mars, who squats down, makes eye contact with me, and peeks at me with a worried look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Guess who got me into this shambles ......!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;D-don't get carried away!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Did I say something to get on your nerves!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-You said it was love at first sight, you said you liked me, and you said you loved me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I didn't even say I love you, though ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;He certainly didn't say it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I've even started to hear hallucinations!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I feel even more embarrassed and fall flat on my face again</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Oh God, my face must be a mess now!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-You should at least say I love you anyway! It says in almost every book that when you push a woman, you just push her!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-Is that so, I love you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I do not love you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though you made me say it!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I was a little glad to be told that. It's humiliating!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When I think about it, I have lived a long time, and never once have I been told such words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was written in so many books, but it seemed like a world I had no connection to.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I had only seen elven men when I was a small child, and since then I had been alone in the human world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But that doesn't mean that &#8213;&#8213;</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I-I would never bond with you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'll do my best to make you like me. Because I like Lilia.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kuhh ......, a-are you still saying that ......! I don't like humans!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's fine for now. Come on, let's go out to eat. How about meat and fish?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;T-This man!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At this stage, he's still talking about food.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's embarrassing that I seem to be the only one overly concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Elves are not lower creatures like humans who give in to short-circuited impulses.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I-I'd like an egg dish ...... that fluffy one you made me the other day. ...... &#8213;&#8213;Ah, no, no, that's not it! It's not that I want to eat Master's cooking or that I feel safer alone with you! I just can't accept the choice between meat and fish! Don't take it as a convenience!&#12288;I'm just saying I don't like being in an all-human space!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is this by any chance called tsundere......!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I told you, don't use words I don't know! A-anyway, let's get back to the inn! We've rented a room with a kitchen, so let's make the most of it! I'll help you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Standing up and looking down, I push Mars back and lead him towards the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I couldn't look him straight in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If I made eye contact, something inside me would break.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I would never bond with him!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;How could I have thought that I would have been bonded long ago by this time?</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;In time, I became happy to be called names I didn't like to be called, sharing meals became the norm, and the longer we stayed together and the more favors were expressed every day, the easier it was for the walls to fall down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And the reality began to weigh heavily on me that I could not be with Mars even for the time it took for a single wrinkle to appear on my face.</p>
