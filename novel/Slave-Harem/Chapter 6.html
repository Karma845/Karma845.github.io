<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next morning, Mars was the first one to wake up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But it wasn't an early wake-up call. It was early afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Next to him was Lilia, naked and asleep, hugging Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thinks it's beautiful to see the roundness of Lilia's thin, white shoulders sticking out from the blanket.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With her eyes closed, he can see that Lilia's eyelashes are long.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Next to him on the other side was Hazuki. This one was fully clothed, lying on her back, breathing softly in her sleep. The insanity of yesterday's madness has completely disappeared, and her innocent face is adorable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8213;&#8213;What is this, a harem?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;There are beautiful girls on both sides of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8213;&#8213;She looks serious and pretty when you look at her like this: .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I think she's a horny little bastard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A serious-looking girl asks for a cock while panting&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm glad I was reincarnated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8213;&#8213;I feel like I could easily sleep with her if I wanted to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I mean, it's almost as if I've already taken her, isn't it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Because right now, she's sleeping next to me with no panties on, you know?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After his morning erection subsided, Mars shook Lilia awake with a shake.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he's not diving in dungeons, he tends to wake up in the afternoon or evening like this, and have sex again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was also because of his morning erection. When Lilia misunderstood that he was in heat, she would reflexively go into heat herself. The two of them were horny most of the time in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm going to be back from the dungeon in the evening, so I want to collect as much as I can until then</span>, said the calm, non-Mars self. <span style="font-style: italic;">In order to do that, I can't just stay in bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmm.......Good morning ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rubbing her eyes, Lilia rubbed her cheek against Mars' arm. It was a relief to wake up in the morning and have Mars next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good morning, Lilia. It looks like yesterday wasn't a dream.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia opened her eyes at Mars' words, even though she had been smiling and indulging him with a muffled "mmm" and her eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That female ...... is shameless, isn't she? She can masturbate to her heart's content in someone else's room and spend the night on her own,......, but I thought she'd sneak back in while we were asleep.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia does not like the sleeping Hazuki. The fact that Hazuki was sleeping so peacefully made Lilia angry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Why is there an outsider in the space where they are alone?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That sounds terrible, doesn't it? Anyway, I'll make some breakfast. What do you want to eat? I think I'll make one for her, too. I'm sure it's for a reason, and it's not my taste to just show her what we're eating.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia rolled her eyes, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Are you serious?"</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It was more than enough for him to let her stay here, and now he's giving her a meal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Isn't he too good-natured?</span> But Lilia liked that about Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were a lot of ingredients that Mars had brought with him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;You can defeat a demon, but you can't defeat hunger. Even in in-game dungeons, hunger is the worst enemy in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since he had brought his favorite cooking tools, he planned to provide for everything on his own from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The food served at the dungeon inn was exceptionally bad, even among the bad food in this world. He can't imagine letting Lilia eat it because it would destroy her stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After coming to this world, he started to pursue the taste.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In his previous life, Mars hated to eat, but now it is one of his pleasures.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That kindness ...... I think that kind of thing about Master is honestly a good thing, but it's also a bad thing. It's not like we can afford it either, but we share it with others. It feels like an obsession to help others. Even up to this point, you've been giving food and your meager possessions to the poor. I have not interfered with you in the past because I am a slave, the property of Master, but I think you have gone a little too far.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;What is the point of giving to someone who doesn't want to get anything for themselves?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Isn't that the end of being spoiled?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I think it's crazy to give to people who are on the side of taking in the first place.</span><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This was Lilia's value system as an elf, so she did not say anything. Mars is also a human.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......It's easy for people to die if they are abandoned. Even if you regret it afterward, there's nothing you can do about it. That's why I'm not going to abandon you. I may cause Lilia some trouble, but...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;This is it. This strange duality of Mars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's expression didn't change, but her thoughts ran through her mind. It's a strange feeling that she has felt from Mars several times before this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars usually gives the impression of being a goofy boy, but sometimes he becomes darker as if he has changed into someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A human seventeen-year-old should be a child. And yet, Lilia sometimes felt as if she was dealing with an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia had the impression that he was a clown playing the role of a boy who was liked by everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;What was at the root of Mars?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason why Lilia couldn't ask was that she could easily imagine that it was the dark part of Mars' heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I understand. I don't know the eating habits of this female, so let's go with something safe. Personally, I'd like to try some egg dishes. Is there anything I can help you with?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm okay, you don't have to help me today, so I'd like to ask you to take care of her. If you want eggs ......, I'll make an omelet.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Omelets are one of Mars' favorite dishes these days. He has learned to make them into beautiful shapes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, those fluffy ones. I like it very much. Master is a good cook. Now, shall I wake up this female and at least get her dressed to go out in public? May I lend her some of my clothes?&#12288;They're not clothes, but underwear.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The white children's panties that Hazuki was wearing were curled up against the wall since Lilia had kicked them off to the corner of the room yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia didn't like the smell of other females in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. You do that. She can keep the panties. I'll buy you as many new ones as you want. Wouldn't that be better for Lilia? If I wake her up, I think she'll go into shock, so please do it for her.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;You're right&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Wouldn't it be the same if I did ......?&#12301;</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia wakes up Hazuki, who is sleeping peacefully as if nothing had happened while wondering.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next moment, a scream roared through the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can-can I borrow your sword for a moment!? I-I want to die!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You don't have to die! Don't worry about masturbating! We do it too! I haven't done it at all these days!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Lilia woke her up, Hazuki rolled up the blanket to confirm her lower half was naked, then took Mars' sword from the wall and pulled it from its sheath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was convinced that yesterday had not been a dream. Then Hazuki shuddered in shame and began to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars took the sword from Hazuki in a flash and sat her down to calm her down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But still, it was a very lascivious thing to do.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked down at Hazuki and said in a cold tone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, why are you giving her a final blow!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aha, ahahaha...... I want to die. I can't live with myself if they see me like that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's eyes watered, and she murmured in a whisper.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's okay, it'll be all right! Even Lilia was so quiet yesterday!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the first thing that came out of Mars' mouth. It was the only thing he could think of.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars!? Are you attacking me, too!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-No, she's gonna die if you don't cover for me!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Taking away everything that could be dangerous except the sword, Mars desperately tried to calm down Hazuki and Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia didn't like that Mars called her a lewd woman, and even Lilia got angry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was crying, and Lilia was angry. Mars is puzzled as to how this happened.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After letting her take a shower, Hazuki calmed down a bit, and with a bright red face, she started to shyly express her thoughts about the sex between Mars and Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Why did you go out of your way to invite this topic after I covered it for you?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Don't you really want to talk about it?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;That or she's an idiot</span>, Mars thought, almost dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm really sorry. ...... My body went crazy when I saw the two of you making babies. ...... It-It was amazing. To see such a big one going in and out ...... and it looks amazingly feels good.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pinching the index fingers of both hands together, Hazuki blushed and looked up at Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;That's blatantly flirtatious eyes. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars couldn't help but gulp raw at the sight of Hazuki's upturned eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;F-for now, let's put that aside and have dinner together, shall we?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If she keeps talking like this, he'll start to swell up again even though he had already contained his morning erection.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm sorry to bother you with this, but i-is there a different kind of underwear that I can use ......? The one I borrowed was a bit transparent, or rather, the front was almost completely opened. ...... The back was like a string, but not at all, and the sides would come undone if you pulled on it, making it unreliable, what if someone sees this!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars smiled a little at Hazuki as she spoke with confusion as if she remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Lilia's underwear is all kinds of erotic!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, what kind of underwear did you give her?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's normal, okay? It's one of the many black T-back. The lace fabric is indeed almost transparent in the front. This pervert woman had pubic hair, so I'm sure you can see it in full from the front.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Lilia carried Hazuki into the bathroom, Hazuki was startled and opened her legs wide, exposing Hazuki's hidden parts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fluffy pubic hair caught Lilia's eye and she thought it was dirty.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was proud of the fact that she had never had pubic hair in her entire life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What, such a mature-looking girl is wearing such an erotic thing? &#8213;&#8213;Can you show me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I won't show you, okay!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The more she talked about yesterday, the more Hazuki felt like she was going to hurt herself, so Mars changed the subject to make fun of her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After the meal was prepared, the three of them gathered around the table that was provided in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki continued to eat, refraining from eating, and yet boldly eating more.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They couldn't say anything as Hazuki ate more than Mars and Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;By the way, what's your name?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-This is really delicious. ...... Can I have another one? My name is Hazuki Azathoth. I'm eighteen years old. Uh, what about you two?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;One year older ...... That's why she's so lewd?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;No, I guess it doesn't matter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars realized that his thoughts were going in an unfamiliar direction and stopped thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The impression of last night's masturbation is too strong for him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's still some left, so eat as much as you like. I'll make more when the food is gone. I'm Mars Irving. This is my girlfriend&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars tried to put one hand on Lilia, Lilia made a sound as if to cover.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She did not turn her head but looked at the omelet that Mars had made for her.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I don't like humans except for Mars. They all make fun of me, an elf, on the inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My name is Lilia Silvestry. As you can see, I'm an elf. I won't remember you, and you can forget me, but I hope you don't mind my acquaintance. &#8213;&#8213;Pervert woman&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki didn't seem to understand what was said at the end, but she froze for a moment and then shouted out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Pervert woman!? M-Me!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was tremendous masturbation. You were trying so hard to get my master to come into heat&#8213;&#8213;I'm not going to give him to you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her tone of voice changed from calm to full of emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was glad to see Lilia's occasional possessiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm kind of happy, but ...... Aren't you feel sorry for her?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert ...... Pervert ...... I am a pervert ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He felt sorry for Hazuki, who kept repeating the word "pervert" in hushed tones.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But she is a pervert woman. She's definitely a pervert woman. And Mars doesn't deny it at all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So why are you in the dungeon?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though Hazuki can use magic better than others, Mars thinks that dungeons are not the right place for girls to come. <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm not a feminist, but I can't erase my prejudices.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Most of the adventurers are old men with big muscles. Even the boy, Mars, was a little out of place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's see, umm ...... my purpose is the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;. I've been looking for a book on &#12302;Necromancy&#12303;, a magic that is said to have died out in ancient times. I'm sure there's a dungeon where I can't even tell when it was created.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I think this is the first time she's said anything decent. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thinks, but he doesn't make fun of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What is the reason? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I personally don't think it's a good idea to bring back the dead. There's no limit to it, and it messes with our ethics.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm against it too. ...... If I wanted to, I would want to see my parents again, but I'm sure that's something I shouldn't do. ...... My goal is to completely destroy necromancy. That's my mission.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert woman, are you a member of the Tomb Guard clan or something?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When she heard that it was a mission, Lilia asked a question that seemed to come to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who was called pervert, but she pretended not to notice it and passed it off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">She's surprisingly strong mentally, this girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While admiring the quality of the omelet he had made, Mars was also impressed by the strength of Hazuki's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-yes, you know it well, don't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, please explain. I don't know anything about that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'll do it first. Well, as the name Tomb Guard implies, our clan guards a certain tomb.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A tomb?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's right. The one who lies in that tomb&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/55bR5mh/00018.jpg" alt="00018" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia cut in at Hazuki's words, who was about to say something after a short pause.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The result was that Lilia stood out more because she had attracted the attention of Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Evil Priest Norn. He's an ancient priest who was plotting to revive the evil gods. He was the former chief of her clan but was killed by his own people.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia said flatly as she put the omelet in her mouth, and Hazuki could not hide her surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki looks disappointed, so much so that the sound effect of a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gaa~nn</span>" echoes in Mars' head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia knows a lot of things, and Lilia is looking for an opportunity to show off her knowledge. This is a good match for Mars, who doesn't have much knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Lilia. You shouldn't have interrupted Hazuki's line, all right? She's a little surprised, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-No, I don't mind...... Simply put, it's my mission to destroy &#12302;Necromancy&#12303; from this world so that Norn will not be resurrected. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">She just gave up and put it all together because Lilia interrupted her lines. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I feel sorry for her in so many ways. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But isn't that really endless? You don't even know what dungeon that book is in, it could be in a lot of places.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. But we can't let Norn come back to life. &#8213;&#8213;Only girls are born in our clan. It's because of the curse that Norn placed on our clan at the time of his death to make his blood run out or fade. In addition, it seems that because of this, we have a higher sex drive than normal people. ...... I thought it was normal, but I found out that it was true after I started my journey. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki blushed as she made some excuses. She wants to say that yesterday's lasciviousness was because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's kind of amazing ...... is it the cursed magic?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Correct. I've heard that Norn was such a powerful wizard that he could use such powerful magic even on his deathbed. If he is resurrected, the whole world might be filled with the same kind of curse. That's why we have to destroy the &#12302;Necromancy&#12303;.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lifting her eyebrows, which were always in a troubled 八 figure, Hazuki looked a little intense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As a matter of fact, Hazuki hadn't told Mars everything.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was another purpose for Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was to bring back a strong man to her home village.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was no longer inevitable that her clan blood would fade, but if that was the case, she would at least put strong blood in her veins.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If a man can conquer dungeons, the child born will have a high probability of being strong, so she stayed with Zerius, who is even called "Thunder," even if she didn't like him inside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'll burn them too if we find that book.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's not that I'm not interested, but it's because I don't think we should be reanimating people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay. I'll go back then. I'm sure Zerius is angry. ...... Oh, I remember! I came here to apologize for Zerius's rudeness yesterday!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's not necessary. You're so polite.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki is not responsible for anything. She was involved in the dispute between Mars and Zerius, so she's more of a victim.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">You can stay here if you want. You can just work with us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars only thought about it but didn't say it out loud, because it was out of pity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was nosy, bordering on condescending, to say something like that without being asked to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That was supposed to be the case, ...... but after the disgraceful behavior of me, I was very surprised ...... to even receive the meal. This egg dish was so fluffy and delicious. It was the first time I had eaten such delicious food, so I forgot my reservations and ate it. ......&#8213;&#8213;Thank you for the meal.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki bowed profoundly and left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the end, Hazuki ate about three times as much as Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When she left, Hazuki looked sad and lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki wanted to stay. But she couldn't say that. Hazuki knew that Mars had nothing to do with her clan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki realized that she felt like she had laughed a lot in the past few hours. It was the first time since she had met and started working with Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I want to spend more time with him. I feel like I can always smile with him</span>, thought Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">The mission of the clan ...... Is there really a person who is bound by such a thing?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although there had been none in his previous life, this was the first time Mars had directly seen a person whose principle of action was a mission.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He also thought it was admirable. He lives every day as he pleases, but Hazuki is about the same age as Mars, and she lives with a strong purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars also has a purpose, but it's not as noble as Hazuki's, and it's only for himself. In any case, Mars only prays for Lilia's personal happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There are all kinds of people, huh ...... I've never seen anyone who's on a mission or anything like that before. &#8213;&#8213;She ate like crazy.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I thought she was going to go into heat and attack Mars, but ...... she was quite rational.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Isn't Lilia's assessment of Hazuki too harsh?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think it's objective, isn't it? She masturbated in someone's room until she passed out from exhaustion, ate more food than Master, and slept more soundly than anyone else. She is the incarnation of the three great desires. There is nothing to evaluate.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">You definitely don't like her .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Lilia calls Hazuki a pervert woman. ...... Well, she is really a pervert woman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at Lilia's pouting face, Mars began to prepare to leave the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'd better get going, too. We don't have much time since it's not until the evening.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. &#8213;&#8213;I'm Master's only sex slave, okay. Don't forget that. I won't be shaken.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was aware of Hazuki's wavering feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's eyes were shining as she looked at Mars, who made no distinction whatsoever, even to Lilia, his slave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars&nbsp;was kind, strong, and had a special calmness about him that made him very attractive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who had never met a love rival before, had a sense of crisis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmm? What do you mean? It's not so heavy that you can't shake it, is it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It means that for me, Mars is the only master. &#8213;Come on, let's get going.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">What does she mean?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm not sure what it means.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Maybe she's jealous......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If so, she's too cute.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After leaving Mars's room, Hazuki walked around, glancing behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She hoped that Mars would come after her from behind, even though she knew that was not possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I don't want to go back to Zerius. ...... Maybe he'll hit me again for acting alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I don't think Mars would ever hit Lilia. ...... He was so kind to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He even cooked for his slave Lilia, ...... and she ate the same food. And Lilia did it as if it was normal. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I just eat what everyone else has leftover. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Slave and master. There is a clear hierarchy in their relationship, but Mars and Lilia don't seem to have that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The envy turned to resentment, and Hazuki felt self-loathing.</p>
