<h3>Prologue</h3>
<p>&#12288;It was love at first sight in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>&#12288;A blonde girl with long, pointed ears moored to the fence at the entrance of the tavern.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl was tied to a thick chain that stretched from a heavy collar and a short chain that connected her legs, restricting her movement and exposing her to the world as a spectacle.</p>
<p>&#12288;As she sat there, looking as if she had been thrown out of the world, it was immediately clear that she was an elf, not a human, and that her status was that of a slave.</p>
<p>&#12288;The wooden price tag hanging from her neck was faded and the price could not be read clearly. The black marks smeared on the wood were probably dried blood. I think the girl herself had scraped it off with her fingernails. At the very least, this girl has not accepted being a slave.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the darkness, the black-haired boy, Mars, could see the girl's golden hair fluttering in the night breeze like a beautiful moon.</p>
<p>&#12288;The proportions of the girl's body were perfect, and her face was so well-formed that it looked like a doll.</p>
<p>&#12288;The clear, white skin is stained with mud and dirt, and I suspect that she has not been bathed well.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's ice-blue eyes had no light in them, and they drifted through the air with a blank, empty gaze, looking nowhere.</p>

<p>&#12288;The girl's price, according to the number of digits written on the price tag, is enough to buy a couple of decent houses. However, the price was not important to Mars.</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment he saw the girl, dressed only in dirty clothes the color of a burlap sack, his heart and fate might have been decided.</p>
<p>&#12300;If you don't mind, would you like to come with me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Malus approached and called out to her gently. The girl did not answer but only raised her face to look at Mars.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's eyes, which said nothing, seemed to be telling Mars to help her.</p>
<p>&#12300;Come with me. Let's live together from now on. I'm alone, too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Mars stretched out his hand and smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&#12288;Lilia, an elf girl who saw Mars' face, which looked like he was crying even though he was smiling, nodded her head and gently touched Mars' outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&#12288;Thus, one and one with the same eyes became two.</p>
