<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Am I doing well?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ugh...... if you do it any better, it's going to be bad, so I don't mind leaving it as it is...... the pressure on your breast is crazy...... soft and munchy...... the material is already great......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fufu&#9825; Your hips are starting to lift&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's feels good .....! &#8213;&#8213;Y-you're not supposed to use your tongue! Th-the tip!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia were flirting naked next to Hazuki, who was sound asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia entered between the legs of Mars, who was lying on his back and served him with her proud breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' huge cock was completely covered, and only the tip came out as he moved up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia decided that she would give Mars a good paizuri because that was something Hazuki couldn't do.</p>
<p class="calibre"><i>&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The sight of her coming insight was erotic.</i></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's pure white skin was dyed bright red, and her eyes were squinting a little mischievously as she served him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's hardened nipples that Mars could see, her pink nipples that were puffy and swollen, her long pointed tongue that extended to the glans, everything was arousing Mars.</p>

<a href="https://ibb.co/w4xCrBH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qpP9F7G/00020.jpg" alt="00020" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Once the cock was inserted into Lilia's vagina, Lilia was no match for Mars, but when she was serving, she could afford to be.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was floating on his hips and was being defeated by the one-sided pleasure he was being given.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So cute ......&#9825; I like Mars' mellow face ......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-that's a bit complicated! &#8213;T-this could be bad. I've climbed up ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Please give me plenty &#9825; Would you like to let it out in my face? Or would you like it on my tits? Or in my mouth?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In her own words, Lilia emphasizes each part.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm so torn! It's the ultimate choice!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Everywhere is erotic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;But if I don't decide soon, I'll cum.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then, please let it out in all of place&#9825; Mars' is full, so there should be plenty of room to pour it all over&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia sticks out her tongue, and the flow of it licks the underside of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her chest, too, was moved up and down violently as the force of her hand between them increased.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars let out a small squeal and stretched out his legs, putting pressure on his toes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's coming out......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;splurt, splurt, spluuuuurrttt!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The semen splattered on Lilia's face, hair, tongue, and chest, connecting like jelly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In no time at all, Lilia's upper body was covered in foul-smelling semen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmm.......So many ...... It smells amazing &#9825; A strange taste that always makes you dizzy no matter when you lick it ...... Yesterday it was bitter, but today it feels a little sweet... ...! Your dick is also white and sticky ...... so I'll clean it up&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With semen on her face, Lilia carefully licks Mars' cock.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is the type of person who doesn't use her hands when giving a blowjob but only uses her mouth to serve. This was not something that Mars had taught her, but she had done it herself.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Lick, slurrp</span>, The semen in his flesh was also sucked out, and Mars frowned, looked up at the ceiling, and then looked at Lilia again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmnn, Hmm....&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looks into Mars' eyes and continues to suck.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There's no way his dick going to get smaller after something like this, and it makes Mars more and more sexually aroused.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pulling himself up a little, Mars strokes Lilia's head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is what Mars thinks about every day, but he can't help but love Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, I love you&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia widened her eyes for a moment and stops her tongue from licking around the glans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Shortly after, however, Lilia took the cock all the way to the base, and with a melting look in her eyes, she moved her head up and down in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia took the hand that Mars had unconsciously extended and squeezed it gently.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, if you do it too intensely, it will come out again. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In response to Mars's call, Lilia released her mouth and came up to Mars's stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmm, Nnhh&#9825; Slurrp....haah, haaa.....I like you, Master......&#9825; Sex, I want to have sex after all......!&#9825; I'm already so hot that my body is burning. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, covered in semen, was <span style="font-style: italic;">haah-haah</span> and looking at Mars with a rutted face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I want to do it too, but ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars glanced at Hazuki next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If the bed shook violently, no matter how much, it might wake her up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if it didn't, there would be a sound and a smell.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In the bathroom, shall we do it in the bathroom? I want you to do it from behind! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Let's do it. I can't endure it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They moved naked to the bathroom and hugged and kissed each other while taking a shower together.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was rubbing his erect penis against Lilia's belly as he felt her breasts pressed against him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The difference in their heights made it so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sensation of her uterus being pressed from the outside made Lilia moan sweetly and writhe.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sound of the two of them connecting in the closed room echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The high-pitched sound resonated well in the enclosed bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With her hands on the edge of the bathtub, Lilia bent over and thrust her hips up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars grabbed Lilia's waist as if to lift her up, and frantically moved his own hips back and forth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hah, hah...... Lilia's inside is hotter than usual......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master's, ahh, ahh, c-cock, nnkhh, ahh.....&#9825; m-my body is lifted up from the inside ......&#9825; I-it feels so good! &#9825; &#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's moaning, like a little bird's call, echoes and reaches Mars' ears from all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It feels good, but my feet are slipping and I can't concentrate. ......! I'm going to slip!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;After all in the bed, let's do it in bed! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia's minds had completely lost track of Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pushing Lilia down on the edge of the bed in the room darkened for Hazuki to sleep, Mars inserted it in a missionary position and shook his hips.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since he had inserted inside her earlier, there was no need for foreplay.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While he was moving his hips, Mars could only see Lilia in his vision.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Holding her hands together and pressing her against the bed, Mars was engrossed in devouring and giving pleasure to her at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The movement of her breasts, which move in all directions like a living creature, her reddened and sweaty neck, and Lilia's distorted expression whenever Mars thrusts deep into her, fuel Mars' sexual desire more and more.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thought the bed would get wet because he moved without wiping his hair and body well, but that didn't matter.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Right now, pleasure is all he wants. <span style="font-style: italic;">I want to fall into a dream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, Lilia ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars ......! &#9825; Ahh, mmm, ahhh......! &#9825; Kiss, kiss me please ......! &#9825; I-I'm about to cum. ......! &#9825; I'm sorry, I went ahead. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Go ahead, I'm so happy! I'm still a little more ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aahhh, I-it's coming, I'm coming! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars's legs and back are still tired from walking around all day, but his hips don't stop.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's vagina sweetly melts away the fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia also lifted her hips and entwined her legs with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the middle of their intense intercourse, Hazuki's quiet *suu-suu* sleepy breathing turns into a violent *haah-haah*.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No amount of shaking off this bed violently woke her up and made her aware of the sound of flesh crashing against flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Th-they're mating again .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">W-Why does they sound so comfortable ......? I-I'm getting so horny .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I felt a tingle in the pit of my stomach, a place I would never touch myself,.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I-I want to mate with Mars-san too,...... but betraying Zerius is........scary</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The face of a man who, as soon as he gets angry, points his fist and sword at her, is in Hazuki's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki is basically feeble-minded and not good at talking to people because she is afraid of being disliked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only reason she can talk to Mars and the others is because they have seen her embarrassing moment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Compared to that, she is fine with talking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder if Mars-san would protect me from Zerius.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;He was really desperate to come to me when I fell into the hole earlier, and he was ...... cool. He was so worried about me even though we just met.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;He was very happy to know that I was safe and..........What if it was Zerius?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;But......I can't beat Lilia-san .....</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;She hates me and ...... she calls me a pervert woman,......&#8213;Well she's right, but,.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm probably a little more interested in that kind of thing than everyone else. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Just a little bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, ugh! I love you......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Me too, I love you too ......! &#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Hazuki opened her eyes thinly and looked to the side, she saw that Mars and Lilia were sticking close to each other, saying they liked each other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They stroked each other's heads, kissed each other's foreheads, and seemed to know no bounds to the flirting between Mars and Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki envied Lilia with all her heart. Hazuki had little experience of being cared for. Moreover, since she had been with Zerius, being with someone had become a painful experience for her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Did Zerius ever tell me he liked me?.....nope</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Perhaps I was like a slave?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Lilia-san, who is really a slave, seems much happier ...... she was treated so well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;That's nice. I'd like to have my head gently stroked like that too,.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If I become a slave of Mars-san, Will I be protected like that ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if she is a little brazen, Hazuki is an eighteen-year-old girl. Living a life in which she was beaten up every day was driving her mentally to the point of near exhaustion. Hazuki began to think that she was even willing to become a slave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is not sure if she can really fulfill her own goals, and since it is no different from chasing a fantasy, she feels a strong sense of exhaustion. Therefore, she tends to escape to the pleasures that are right in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Why was I with Zerius ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Yes, it was to attack the dungeon. To capture it and burn the book of &#12302;Necromancy&#12303; so that Norn would not come back to life. To destroy Norn's corpse to break the curse and fulfill the clan's long-cherished wish.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Ah, but Zerius is not a &#12302;Thunder&#12303;, and if Mars-san were a real ......, if it's the case .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki felt liquid flowing from her groin and came up with an excuse for herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It was Zerius who first betrayed and lied. It was not me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars-san, I, too, want to mate with Mars-san ......too......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a blushed face and wet voice, Hazuki calls out to Mars, who is humping hard in the corner of the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When she called out several times, there was no response, and when she thought that the movement of his hips had finally stopped, Mars jerked and arched his back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Uuuuuuggggh!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's voice did not reach Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His head was hot, and it was the moment when all of Mars' thoughts disappeared except for ejaculation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars's hard cock, twitching inside me,...... full of warmth,...... more, please let it out more,......! &#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a dreamy expression on her face, Lilia put both hands between Mars' ears so that he could not hear the sounds around him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was simple, Lilia knew that Hazuki was awake and calling out to him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ugh, ughhh ...... it won't stop ...... ugh...Lilia.....!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Huh, they're ignoring me. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki is truly surprised and at the same time envious that the two people in front of her are not looking at her at all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a blessing to be able to see and even hears nothing but each other.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I am also intrigued by the pleasure that may accompany it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ugh,......, it's still coming out,......, and it's coming out too much,......&#8213;&#8213;Hazuki-chan!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you finally noticed me......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Fearfully on all fours on the bed, Hazuki approaches.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's breasts could be seen through the gap in her overstuffed camisole, and Mars stared at them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are much smaller than Lilia's but slightly fuller, and the nipples at the apex are pink and azuki-brown in size. They stood up straight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One of her eyes, which could be seen moistening even in the dimly lit room, was fixed on Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's terrible to compare it with Lilia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ma-Mars-san. I-I ...... probably like you, Mars-san, ...... I'm so excited and I want to continue to be with you. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-thank you ...... but I hope you won't look at me too much right now ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">What a time to confess!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I was so surprised, I kinda came out again!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And she said probably!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-So please go out with me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sorry, I can't do that. Uh, I don't know what to say, but this situation is the answer ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I am one with Lilia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If I said I would go out with her in this situation, Lilia would definitely slap me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia pulls Mars, who is leaning against her, and buries Mars' face in her chest to hide it from Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's neat face was burning with anger.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't you dare butt in, you pervert woman. ......! Master is mine and mine alone. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's painful ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars has difficulty breathing in Lilia's chest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm suffocating on her tits. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-But I like Mars-san, too, ...... a-and I don't want to have him all to myself, but if we could be together as the three of us, like now, and if he could m-mate with me, too, that would be great. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You go ahead and clean up your mess with that guy! Don't approach Mars as if you have feelings for either of them! It would be too much of an insect to try to get something out of a state of dishonesty that insures against socializing!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Lilia doesn't like most is Hazuki's simmering state.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She can't forgive Hazuki for half-heartedly approaching Mars, the man she loves the most.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I can forgive Mars for being popular. I also think it's inevitable. Given the elements that Mars possesses, there is no way that he could be left alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Puhah......I was about to die the happiest man in the world......&#8213;&#8213;Hazuki, you're going to cheat on me, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After escaping from Lilia's cleavage, Mars says in a calm voice as he catches his breath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if you call it cheating, the relationship between Zerius and Hazuki is already broken. Looking at Zerius' attitude, it is doubtful to Mars that there was even a romantic relationship from the beginning. Still, it is not a good idea to proceed with the relationship in an ambiguous manner. If, as Lilia says, a sense of guilt arises within Hazuki that she has been dishonest, there will surely come a day when she will feel a sense of guilt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Cheating ......, b-but I've never mated with Zerius or anyone else ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-that's not what I'm talking about. ...... I'm talking about the spiritual. In case you're wondering, I'm very possessive. If you choose me, you'll have to leave him once and for all.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Become a slave ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Something like that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Lies. It's not quite the same as possessiveness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars slowly exits Lilia's vagina.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia tightens her vagina with a regretful "kyuu" and Mars is tempted to thrust again but resists the urge.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-Master ......, leave such a pervert woman alone, only me&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia realizes as she says it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Just as he does to her, and just as he does to complete strangers, Mars will never refuse a hand when it is extended.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Mars is self-punishing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;He is kind, but not just kind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;At the root of Mars' kindness is ...... emptiness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The occasional shadow makes Lilia more aware of this.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Mars must have regretted something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I don't know what it is, but I know that it must have been very painful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">He wants affection, but he doesn't believe in affection any more than anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It is for Mars that I will not terminate my slave contract forever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I want him to feel safe, to know that I will always be next to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I am the only one who can protect Mars' heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia knows that the only thing she can offer to Mars, who saved her, is that kind of spirituality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia believes that her long life span is surely for this purpose. Even in the future, when Mars will grow old and die, she will still be there for him, looking just as she does now.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why she is learning to cook and do housework. Because one day, the current position that Mars takes care of her will change, and the day will come when Lilia will have to take care of him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia now truly loves Mars, whom she initially thought of only as an unusual person. No matter how many hundreds of years it may be, the elf never forgets her debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Will M-Mars-san protect me if I become a slave? Would you get angry and point a sword at me or hit me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will protect you. I will take good care of you and I will not be violent. Did you ever see me do that?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-no, ...... rather, you're amazingly kind and ...... calming&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As the bruises on Zerius fade, Mars' presence grows in Hazuki's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki is aware of her inability to read the air. That is why she has never had many friends and has always spent time alone. She values and protects herself like that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She feels Mars like the hero of a fairy tale, Hazuki's eyes lit up when her grandmother read to her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This was true of Mars' original personality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He likes flirting. He is not a man who finds pleasure in violence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Rest assured. &#8213;&#8213;Mars is a man who cares about his things. Whatever it is.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both Mars and Lilia raise themselves up, and Mars sits on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia covers herself with a thin blanket to hide her body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay, then, I'll become your slave. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You decide so easily. ...... I'm afraid of kids these days. You know what? If you say you don't like it, after all, I won't cancel it, okay? Because your life depends on this choice, Hazuki-chan.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is not a good thing for young people to take the wrong path. It didn't seem like an easy decision to make, even if he was confident he could make Hazuki happy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You won't hit me and you'll be nice to me, right ......? That's more than enough, and ...... Besides, in terms of personal safety, I prefer to be with someone who can conquer dungeons alone, has good food, is kind, and is attractive as a man. The fact that I have been strangely horny since I met the two of you must be instinctive.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For the first time, Hazuki spoke calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both Mars and Lilia are a little surprised to see Hazuki showing more calculation than they had expected.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-beside, you know,...... Mate, I want to mate,...... and Zerius's little one is not good enough,...... and Mars's big cock? Otherwise ...... I have this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach that's all mushy and weird ...... and no matter how many times I come, I can't stop the horniness because of it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert ......&#8213;&#8213;Go ahead and pick out a collar from the shelf. Any of them will do. Lilia. Can you do a slave spell for me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at Hazuki's back as she ran enthusiastically, Lilia had mixed feelings but decided that Hazuki's becoming a slave had its own merits.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was hard to believe that Mars, who was currently obsessed with Lilia, would suddenly change his attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm going to protect Hazuki-chan. The quickest way to do that is to make her a slave and make her mine. She'll be safe from everyone except those who fight with me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I understand. And Master doesn't seem to like the idea of slaves that much. Certainly, I can be upright because I am also the master's property. Otherwise, no store would take me in as an elf. Making me a slave is the shelter of the highest order.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even Lilia understands Mars' intentions. Her dislike stems from her feelings as a woman and is simply selfish.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia does not particularly dislike Hazuki. Although she is human, she doesn't look at her elf self disgustingly, and for better or worse, she is honest. After all, they are the same in the sense that they have nothing else to rely on but Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But Lilia still doesn't like Hazuki because she can't have Mars all to herself anymore. She wanted to be alone with him for a little while longer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;And while we're at it, why don't you get a cute collar for you too, Lilia? It's heavy, isn't it, that collar? It would be inconvenient if the range of motion of the neck was too small.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's collar is a heavy metal collar that she has worn since he bought her from a slaver.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It makes a clunking sound whenever it hits something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She also seems to suffer from stiff shoulders, so Mars thinks that she should at least have a softer, lighter collar.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is one of the reasons why Mars bought all kinds of collars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm used to it now. A-And I can wash my neck properly!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It doesn't smell, okay? Lilia smells sweet to me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-is that so ......, If so, I can change mine later. I would be happy if the master would choose one for me. There are so many, I don't know which one you prefer.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's up to the wearer. If it's Lilia, you would look good on anything. Why not just change it every day anyway?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whether it's burly or choker-like and cute, it should be pretty no matter which one she wears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why he bought so many of them.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I really don't want to change it ......&nbsp;Because this is also a memento.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia thought of this as she touched the cold, heavy collar.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That day when Mars saved her, the collar that had only bound her became a bond.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If this collar had not connected Lilia, they would never have met.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;When I think about it, I was glad to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A slave's contract is tied to the soul, and it doesn't matter what kind of collar it is. The only thing they have in common is that they cannot remove it themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Slavers use sturdy metal ones because the majority of slaves are still uncontracted.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since they are not bound by contract, they are physically bound.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For better or worse, there is a belief in firsts, and many clients want to be the first contractor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is one of those who has been with a slave merchant for a while without a contract.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The existence of elves was something that was shunned by humans. Mars does not know why. It was something that no one ever talked about.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I am already happy. That is why I will always be your slave. Oddly enough, I feel like my life finally began on that day when I lost the possibility of freedom when I was bound by contract to Mars&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's kind of embarrassing ...... but I hope we can be together forever.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I wish it were in this dungeon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;.&nbsp;In my hands, I hold magic that can twist reason.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars desires above all else the power to make his wishes come true.</p>
