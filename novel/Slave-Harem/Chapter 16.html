<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p class="font-120per" id="toc-017">Chapter 16</h1>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Mars.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's cold voice brought Mars back to reality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars's back was flustered because Lilia, who basically called him Master except during sex, also called him Mars right now.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who was too tired to sleep soundly, on the contrary, woke up and went out of the room to look for Mars, who was not next to her and found him overlapping with Hazuki, naked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hauhh ......! Li-Lilia, t-this is not what you think!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Gasping, Mars rises and sees Lilia's face above him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The expression on her face is the one he once saw when they met. Her anger was too obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What is the difference. You must have been overcome with sexual desire and had sexual intercourse with the perverted woman. Perhaps it was the lascivious woman who invited you, but it was you, Mars, who inserted yourself and swung your hips.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars woke up, Hazuki was under Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is more correct to say that he falls asleep in the middle of having sex with Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After having experienced creampie once, Mars was ready for anything and stayed on Hazuki's body for two hours until he ran out of energy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;During this time, he completely stripped off Hazuki's clothes and tore off his own tattered ones.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he finished ejaculating for the last time, Mars passed out with Hazuki still wrapped around him.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh-ahh.....i-it's swelling again......&#9825;&nbsp;It makes my pussy feels good, your cock is killing me ......&#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After the ejaculation had withered away, it continued to be inserted, and Hazuki, who had been laid on it for a long time, did not sleep a wink.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was also due to the feeling of climax that lasted forever.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had a morning erection in his sleep, and Mars invaded Hazuki's narrow vagina again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius ejaculated repeatedly, trembling at the sight of his precious woman climaxing with lewd cries as Mars poured his semen into her over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was so aroused that he thought several blood vessels in his brain had been torn out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After much time passed for a while, Zerius eventually passed out from pleasure and general pain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't feel it, you pervert woman! You snatched up my master!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, heh heh &#9825; Oh, oh, it's so big! &#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was becoming engrossed with Mars, which was growing bigger and bigger inside her vagina, without hearing Lilia's voice.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-sorry! I apologize for cheating on you, so don't blame Hazuki-chan too much!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I forgive Mars. I'm sure you were just bewitched by this pervert woman. Besides, intercourse itself is something I approve of.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Despite her words, Lilia's light ice-colored eyes glowed coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I've never seen her so angry. Maybe she's really a bad guy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I hate you, me, for what I just did!</span></p>

<p class="calibre"><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They packed themselves up to enter the dungeon again. They all took a bath as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The difference was that this time Zerius was with them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was as narrow-minded as Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius didn't say a word, and with a face as if his soul had been drained, he put on Mars' clothes as Mars told him to do.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius, who is bigger than Mars, and is not fully grown, stands there looking a little uncomfortable with his entire body tight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was not inclined to let Zerius remain completely naked. It was simply unsightly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no venom in Zerius as if humans could change so much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the contrary, he was less responsive and more like a puppet.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He thought it would be cruel to let Hazuki do it, so he asked Lilia to heal Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He asked Lilia to heal Zerius so that he would be able to walk on his own, even if only barely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had no intention of making Zerius a companion, so he had to return home alone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There must be someone back in town who can heal him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The labyrinth city has everything a dungeon crawler needs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A-are you okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius looks at Mars but does not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Crap, ...... Is his mind broken?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars felt that he had broken one person and felt guilty indeed.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then I'll open it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After leaving the treasury, the three of them and Zerius stand in front of the golden door at the far end of the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone seemed nervous, but Zerius was the only one who seemed unresponsive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia feared that the treasure might be stolen and suggested that Zerius should be tied up, but Mars rejected the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was dismissed by Mars because Zerius, now wounded and unarmed, was no threat, and with Mars' strength, it would be easy to stop him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But there are no more strong monsters, right ......? This door could be a trap ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who had been caught in so many traps, was alert and stuck to Mars' back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The distance is closer than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's mind is being changed by the lover-like sex they had just had.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can't say for sure that there isn't, but ...... &#12302;Ganymede&#12303; was also a treasure room beyond a door like this.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Noticing Lilia glaring at Hazuki, Mars nudged her.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I'm scared! I have to fix Lilia's mood somehow!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pushing the door with both hands, Mars breaks into the dungeon's treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next moment, Lilia and Hazuki were speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre"><i>&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It was Eden.</i></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I thought it was just stupid human nonsense. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;It's amazing...... as amazing as Mars-sama' cock......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You need to know your place! At least take your breath away for a minute at the sight!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki got teary-eyed and hugged Mars when Lilia smacked her on the head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Li-Lilia-san is messing with me. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-Now-now ...... Come on, come on! Let's take a look inside!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To stop the increasingly angry Lilia, Mars pointed inside the treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What lay before Mars and the three of them, including Zerius, was gold all over the place as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Gold coins and other precious metals, as well as meaningless and extravagant ornaments.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Such treasures filled a room about 50 meters square.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a sea of gold. ...... It's making my eyes hurt&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Lilia mumbled with a stunning face and voice, Hazuki ran toward the pile of gold coins and dove into the pile.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ouch!?&#12288;It's not the sea at all!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki cried and seriously checked the front of her body and her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course! It's a lump of metal, you know!? You're too stupid! Are you that excited!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While taunting Hazuki, Mars looks at Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had expected him to change when he saw the treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;It's amazing, isn't it? Is this the world you live in?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius looks back at Mars with a straight face and speaks out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is not the slightest sign of a change.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While Lilia chided the excited Hazuki, Mars talked with Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the first time he felt like he could talk to Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you want, I'll give you some. I give you all because those two are there, too. I'm only interested in the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;, not so much the money. It's also a way for me to pay for you and your companions.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't want it. I realized that what I wanted was not money or status, but the power to obtain it. &#8213;&#8213;I will surpass you on my own. This time, not with the power of a borrowed name, but with my own power.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A painful sense of helplessness transforms Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He wanted real power, not borrowed or imaginary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The power that could get what he wanted and protect it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And he understood that if he could get it, the results would follow on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, Zerius was filled with anger, but seeing Hazuki's happy face made him realize that he was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius had hardly ever seen Hazuki smile.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The feeling that Hazuki had been stolen from him still lingered in Zerius, but he felt that it had been settled where it ought to be.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you'd been like that from the beginning, we might have gotten along.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's impossible. You beat me, and now I'm doing this. It sounds strange, but I'm no longer angry or impatient. &#8213;&#8213;It's my loss.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Helplessness is a pretty important asset. Much more so than this pile of gold.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;He's not necessarily a bad guy at heart?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If he's good-looking and such a character, he's going to be insanely popular. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Say. How are you so strong? You were the one who defeated that monster, and you were the one who conquered &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;. It's strange no matter how you think about it. How can you be so strong at your age?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'm just building on what I can do. You can be strong, too. If I could give you any advice, it would........I guess it's about mastering one thing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;One thing ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;If so, my path to mastery is the sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Until then, I will accept defeat with open arms.</span></p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;With various emotions in his heart, Zerius said goodbye quietly in his mind to Hazuki, who was happily frolicking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Maybe the &#12304;Treasury House of Dreams&#12305; is magic that definitely exists in dungeons ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were three books on what looked like a bookshelf.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One of the books had a spine that Mars also knew.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;&#12302;Ganymede&#12303; and this &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303; are considered less difficult dungeons compared to the Seven Great Dungeons, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. I heard that the cave type is short. In fact, if you work hard, you can do it in a day. This place was even shorter than &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia responded to Mars' question with a doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He thought this was an unusual way to respond. Lilia is the type of person who answers clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think. I think that this &#12304;Treasury House of Dreams&#12305; magic is essential to conquering other dungeons. In other words, if you don't have it, you can't even get the right to challenge other dungeons. Isn't that how difficult the dungeon is?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's point is that dungeons of higher difficulty may be designed on the assumption that they(adventurers) are conquering dungeons of lower difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had never really thought about it, but now that he knows that there is more than one &#12304;Treasury House of Dreams&#12305;, some things make sense.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The existence of the dungeon is due to someone's will.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In shape and structure, &#12302;Ganymede&#12303; and &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303; are very similar. That alone tells him that it is not a natural occurrence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mysteries of this world ...... Maybe that's the core of it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If so, this is a tutorial.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The real show is still ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars does not voice it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hinin......? What is a "Hinin"?&#12301;<span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN: Hinin/避妊 = Contraception/birth control]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who opened one of the three &#12304;Forbidden Magic Books &#12305;, read a little of the contents and mumbled such words.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can I borrow it for a minute? &#8213;&#8213;Hell yeah. We've hit the jackpot with this one!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It is amazing magic!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's eyes lit up with curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's magic that will make you can't get pregnant!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Eh, that's not a good thing ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In no time at all, Hazuki's expression clouded.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pregnancy is a joyous thing in this world, and the more children you have, the better.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In fact, compared to modern Japan, every household has more children.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if men's sexual power is weak, there is still time, as the world is such that men stop working after dark.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Inevitably, they often have sex at night, and if they do it every day, they will get pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is even more so because there is no concept of contraception.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;You can enjoy sexual intercourse as much as you want without getting pregnant. ...... That's what Master meant when he said it was amazing&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-So you can have sex to make babies every day!? The "<span style="font-style: italic;">spurt spurt spurt spurt"</span>&nbsp;so feels good!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We can do it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a stroke of luck for Mars, who was planning to commission condom production when he got to town.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia had the magic of the &#12304;Treasury House of Dreams&#12305;. If I used it, it would just be a duplicate, and it might be pointless. Once you read through it, it automatically burns.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I see. ...... I'll hold it for you then. I'll leave it to you to decide when to use it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Squeezing it against her chest, Lilia looks really happy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever Mars gives her something, Lilia always has a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I want something too! That birth control thingy?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm going to use this one. I'll give Hazuki-chan the other one.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Muu ...... that was good ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After soothing the groggy Hazuki, Mars hands the other magic book to Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I knew it, there was no book on necromancy here either. ...... I wonder if there really is. Well, it's not that I don't have an idea,......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You'll find it eventually. Now, let's pack the treasure into the treasury and get out of there. &#8213;&#8213;Zerius. At least bring your sword and armor. I don't think you should be out here dressed like that. You're just a plain pervert.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A tight-fitting shirt and a pair of pants. It was a shameful appearance even if he was mentally dressed up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius himself was well aware of this and was inwardly embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's magic equipment right there, isn't it? Is that okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't wear armor or anything like that because it gets in the way, and swords are basically disposable, so anything goes. &#8213;&#8213;I don't want to keep losing things.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One cannot live without a little hope. Mars knows this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why he decided to share.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I guess this is what makes Lilia say I'm a softy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Thank you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Uwahh, that's kinda gross!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What did you say!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah, yeah, that's fine.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nodding yes, Mars is a little relieved that Zerius is regaining his strength.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was scary to think that he had broken someone's spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay, let's call it a triumph.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pack the treasure of the dungeon into the treasury and get on top of the magic circle of movement at the back of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's magic that lets you get out in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;You don't know where you will go out until you try.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;, it teleports you deep into the mountains.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I guess the level of the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; doesn't change unless it's in one of the Seven Great Dungeons. There doesn't seem to be any reason to dive into this kind of dungeon anymore. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars is disappointed that he did not get eternity to spend with Lilia, Hazuki grabs Mars by the arm and says.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then why don't we go to my parents' house?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-Why? Are you getting married or something like that?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I mean, I'm not even done with Lilia yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The style of marriage in this world is appropriate, and unless you are a nobleman, a de facto marriage is the orthodox way. First of all, there is no government office as a prerequisite.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you can afford it, you can have a wedding ceremony to appeal to the people around you, but most people start living together and have children, and then they are recognized as a married couple by the people around them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is planning to hold a grand wedding ceremony with Lilia after he obtains the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;, which can prolong his life span, or if he is unable to obtain it and has to give up the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And at that time, instead of a collar, he plans to give her an extraordinarily beautiful ring.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A-Actually, my hometown is...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That pervert's hometown is the village of Tomb Guard. The area is called the Neustein Valley and is home to one of the Seven Great Dungeons, the Great Norn Tomb. The tomb they guard is the dungeon where the remains of the evil priest Norn are enshrined. Originally, they were supposed to be a clan that controlled and concealed necromancy, but Norn was very interested in using it, and as a result, I hear that he was killed by his own people.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia continues to explain. There was not the slightest room for Hazuki to interject.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The ancestors of the Hazuki clan who buried Norn, the head of the clan who had gone astray, buried the body and everything related to &#12302;Necromancy&#12303; in the place that had been managed by the clan since ancient times as &#12302;The place that connects the other world and this world&#12303;, the current &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;, the Seven Great Dungeons. However, they later learned that Norn had placed a curse on them at the time of his death, and they came to the conclusion that the only way to break the curse was to destroy the remains of Norn, who continued to invoke the magic of the curse even after his death.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The problem was that none of the people who brought the body into the dungeon, nor those who challenged it afterward, ever returned. They don't even know where the bodies are in the dungeon anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you told him first again! W-Why did you say it first!? I rarely get a chance to say anything serious! Y-You brute!&#12301; <span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN: ひとでなしっ&#65281;/Hitodenashi can be translated as bastard or brute, the literal meaning from hitodenashi = not human]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am an elf, so of course, I am not a human. I am even proud to be a nobody. ...... I say this because I am annoyed by the pervert woman's face. You are too attached to Master just because he embraced you once. You should know your place.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia does not like the way Hazuki is attached to Mars. The saving grace is that Mars is not as delirious as he is when Lilia does it to him, but she still doesn't like it a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So ...... if I conquer that Norn Tomb and destroy the body of that Norn or whatever, the curse will be lifted? And if it's the Seven Great Dungeons ...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;There may be a &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; that can extend your lifespan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A-And have a baby with a young girl from our clan! We only have girls in our clan! It has to be the child of a man as strong as you, Mars-san! It has to be someone who can conquer dungeons!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What an amazon your clan is. ...... Aside from making babies, that's where we're going next. I'd like to get a bit of information, but.........that's hard to do when no one's back yet from that dungeon. I don't really like the idea of being haphazard. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Whatever the reality, we have to go there anyway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, the other calm Mars said in his mind that the Seven Great Dungeons should not be taken in the same way as the dungeons he has seen so far.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even the lower layers are, in the extreme, places where no one has ever gone under the entrance and returned.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why the Seven Great Dungeons. It's a world-famous great labyrinth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's all right! The current head of the Tomb Guard, Jin-chan, is two years older than me, and we're not particularly close, and I've only said hello to him, but I'm sure he'll kindly teach us a lot of things!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For some reason, Hazuki was very confident.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's very little evidence! You've only said hello, that's just being a neighbor, that things!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But when I was little, I was famous as &#12302;Hazuki-chan, who always plays with her grandmother's dolls&#12303;, you know? All the kids close to my age know me! So it's all right!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia frankly expresses her thoughts to Hazuki, who is proud&nbsp;of the fact that she was famous.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You, it's because you didn't have any frie&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia! That's the one thing you shouldn't say!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars even uses &#12302;Body Strengthening&#12303; to keep Lilia's mouth shut.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fact that she was famous for not having any friends is .......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As well as being frightened, Mars was saddened that this inability to read the air was probably a factor.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Tap-tap</span>, Lilia taps Mars' hand twice that covers her mouth and shows her attitude that she won't call Hazuki a 'loner' anymore, and after one deep breath, she says.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Leave the pervert woman nonsense behind and you will know something if you are in the Tomb Guard's Village. The clan that managed it at one time or another should at least have some tradition. It is highly doubtful that this pervert woman can be used, but if it is a request from one of the clan's brethren, then she can do a little bit of work.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is that so?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Something like that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yep, yep!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Seriously, the atmosphere changes when Hazuki-chan speaks...... it's her strength, I guess.</span></p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius, who was completely treated as an outsider, was uncomfortably close to the transition magic circle, wearing his magic armor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;When we go outside, please have sex with me as well as purify yourself.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After getting into the magic circle, Lilia grabbed the sleeve of Mars' clothes and said that while blushing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You don't have to tell me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I want to do it too!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The two of you together, all night long!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The four of them go outside without a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no more reason to stay.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon, now devoid of treasure and people, has finished its role and the lowest layer begins to collapse.</p>

<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#8213;&#8213;Wait at the pole</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A single voice echoed through the crumbling, empty dungeon.</p>
