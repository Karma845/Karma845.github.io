<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm motivated, but when I look at the wall, I lose my motivation.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't say that. Let's work hard and save money.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at the brown scenery of the dungeon wall, Mars felt his motivation fading.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He feels like going back to his room and flirting with Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars gave up and dug at the wall, he saw Hazuki wandering alone in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She seemed to be looking for something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hey, isn't that Hazuki-chan?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It is. The pervert woman.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're still calling her a pervert ...... I see, she's such a serious-looking plain girl, but now she's wearing scantily clad black string pants. ...... Erotic!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars could guess that Hazuki was looking for Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Considering that it was a large floor, it was no wonder she couldn't join them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thought about talking to her, but it would be troublesome if she asked him to find Zerius with her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As for himself, he still hadn't forgiven Zerius for making fun of Lilia. It would be different if there was at least an apology.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If you ask for help, I will respond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;That's my rule in this world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From the look on Hazuki's face, Mars knows for sure that Zerius is not on this floor. This means that Zerius and his group have gone down to the lower layers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Saving Hazuki means going down to the lower layers of the dungeon. This is a terrible thing for Lilia, who is probably not prepared for it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Well, it's okay, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was prepared to deal with all kinds of things as soon as he entered the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if it was a sudden and complete attack on the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It suddenly occurred to Mars that the reason Hazuki was with Zerius might have something to do with their age difference. Hazuki was one year older than Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius was about the age of a college student. Mars was seventeen, about the age of a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars was a high school student in Japan, the girls in his class would brag about their older boyfriends.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The difference in knowledge, income, and affordability that comes from the age difference is attractive. It makes you feel like you've grown up. It's almost like dumb magic that will be broken when you get a little older.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I guess it's the same for young girls, even if the world is different, that they yearn for such things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia frowned a little when Mars said that he was excited about Hazuki's underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, by the way, it just so happens that I'm wearing a similar one of Mars' choice today. It's a lot more extreme than that pervert one. Was it "Ro-Raizu"(low-riser)? I'm a little worried because it's only long enough to barely cover my cleft. But when I wore it before, Master was very excited, wasn't he? Your eyes were straight there. &#8213;&#8213;Do you want to see it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was no coincidence. Conscious of what she gave to Hazuki, Lilia also wore something extreme.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you going to show me? I mean, that's for the night too, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course. Because I'm Master's faithful sex slave.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">*gulp*</span>, Mars gulped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's a different kind of excitement when he sees it when it's nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;L-let's go to the shadows over there for a minute. ...... &#8213;&#8213;I sound like a pervert, the way I say it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's already made it so big that it looks like it's going to burst outside. ...... Shall I give you the breast pinching that Master taught me before? It's called paizuri was it? Last time, you were very happy. You ejaculated a lot. It's easy to do with this dress. I don't know why it has a hole in the bottom. &#8213;&#8213;Is it possible that this dress was designed for this purpose from the beginning?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Paizuri is niceee! I'm getting excited!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When the two of them were about to move, Hazuki, who had spotted them from afar, came running up to them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is the nature of Mars to not ignore people when they call out to him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I wanted to see Lilia's extreme panties .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And the paizuri ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though she's wearing a dress with a hole in it for paizuri.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The impatience on Hazuki's face as she approached was obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Oh, I knew this was going to be troublesome</span>, Mars swears in his mind. He doesn't show it on his face. He doesn't stop his bright boy face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Both of you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, ahh, Hazuki-chan. What's wrong? Did you get separated?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-yes! B-but it's different! Zerius and the others probably left me here and headed down to the lower layers on their own!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's face was impatient. It's no surprise that Hazuki is in Zerius's party and knows their strength and the supplies they are preparing. She knows very well that the current situation is not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was only a reconnaissance infiltration.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You really are a hindrance, aren't you, pervert woman? I wish you could at least read the air like a wind spirit. That male is a true termite, and he's no stranger to sneaking in.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-yes ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars smiled bitterly, <span style="font-style: italic;">As expected of Lilia, how harsh</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I think I would cry if I were told the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the eyes of Mars, Zerius and his party seemed unprepared.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were only a few of them, and Zerius was probably the only one who was competent. <span style="font-style: italic;">Besides, how many of them knew what a dungeon was?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the extreme world of dungeons, knowledge is power.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The wider the scope, the more you can see into the details.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lower you go, the more monsters there are, and the more traps there are.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The place they were in was only safe because there were so many people coming and going.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was confused.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was nothing she could do on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Can I leave the man I once had my heart set on to die?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is true that lately, Hazuki has become a target for stress relief, like a sandbag. But Zerius is still her friend and lover.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;The only way to get him out of there is to ask Mars and the others to help, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Not only does she does not know if they will cooperate, but she also doesn't know if they are capable of going to the lower layers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So, Hazuki-chan, what are you going to do? To put it bluntly, we have no obligation to help that guy. He made a fool of Lilia, and I don't like him either.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I thought you were going to say that we should go help him and not abandon him, even if he is such a piece of trash. Given Master's usual behavior.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia shows a surprised face at Mars beside her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' response was different from Lilia's expectation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's a difference between not abandoning and trying to help with everything. He didn't ask me to do it. He did it of his own free will. It's not like he had an unreasonable misfortune. It's just that I didn't think it was possible, but he might be able to pull it off. That's just being nosy.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-You're cold. ...... I somehow thought Mars-san was a kinder person than that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm cold, you see. It's not about others, it's about me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The face of Mars that Lilia saw at that moment was the face of the other Mars that comes out once in a while.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His eyes were narrowed and his mouth was tightly closed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's not a bright and cheerful boy with a playful attitude, but a man with a shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But, Hazuki-chan, it's up to you. If you want me to help you, I will. Then I won't abandon you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars smiled at Hazuki as he returned to his usual face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-Me......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-Master is it safe for us to go to the lower layers ......? N-no, I will go if you order me to. But ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't worry. I'll protect you. &#8213;&#8213;Since we're here, why don't we just go conquer this dungeon? I really wanted to get Lilia used to the atmosphere of the dungeon, but...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He says it as if it's so obvious that the air outside of Mars freezes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was too abrupt to make sense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Lilia had a premonition of what she was about to be told.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A question that she had been feeling for a long, long time. The answer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason for Mars's confidence and a large amount of money.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-That's not so easy............ Even Mars-san might die, you know!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, nope, nope. In fact, the three of us have more than three months' worth of food and other preparations, and more importantly, I can conquer by myself, really. But I wanted to have fun with everyone, and that's why I needed a friend.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Like a magician revealing a secret, Mars was revealing a part of his true nature.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was a different person than Mars Lilia knew.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-What do you mean?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, I'll explain as we walk down to the lower layers, but I was the one who conquered &#12302;Ganymede&#12303; a year ago. I didn't know it was called &#12302;Thunder&#12303;, either. I know why, though. Zerius is just making a big deal out of taking credit for it. I'm not promoting it at all.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It undermines everything that Hazuki has done so far.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If what Mars says is true, then there was no point in staying with Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;What? Mars-san is the real &#12302;Thunder&#12303;?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'll show you the proof. &#8213;&#8213;Open, &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars put his hand to his side, a vague black hole opened up in space.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Putting his hand in there, Mars took out one of Lilia's costumes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;An erotic costume that is slightly uncomfortable to wear in this situation. It was a custom-made sailor suit that Mars had made for her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia almost laughs at the fact that it is so Mars-like, ...... even if he's trying to look cool.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is the magic of the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; that you can get in &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;. You can even go inside it. So far, I've been using it to chain together in my bag. So Lilia doesn't know about this either.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I tried to think that Master was good at storing things. ...... But honestly, I was not that surprised when I heard that you were a treader. I've always had a feeling about that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I knew Lilia suspected me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had been aware that Lilia was aware of this, but had continued to ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He hadn't planned to tell her until the moment came.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia felt that physically speaking, the volume of the bag did not match the total volume of its contents.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh, what?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was confused and looked at both Mars and Lilia over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was most concerned about the price he had paid for her. There were too many other things to worry about.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though elves were relatively cheaper than humans, they were still too big a price for an ordinary person to pay.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's hard to believe that a seventeen-year-old boy would have enough money to buy several cheap houses, or even a mansion if he had to limit himself to just one, but it's hard to believe that a normal person would have the mental capacity to pay for it so easily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Slaves are originally bought by nobles who can afford it, as servants who can be used indefinitely once they are paid. A slave who is known to be able to do things at a high price is more efficient than hiring a normal human being, and more importantly, the fact that they can't go against their master was a good thing for that master to use. If you activate the slave crest, which is the sign of ownership, you can even make the slave comply with orders such as becoming a shield, regardless of the slave's will.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From Lilia's point of view, Mars' familiarity with the dungeon was also strange.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He didn't seem to be nervous at all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With all this information, it made the most sense to assume that Mars was a treader.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason Lilia didn't ask was that she thought that Mars would not want to tell her about it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm sorry I kept it from you, even from Lilia. I was afraid that you might change your mind about me. I also didn't want you to expect something from me. It's not always good to be special or stand out.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I understand. Foreigners will be ostracized. &#8213;&#8213;But please don't underestimate me. I won't change my mind about Master, no matter who Mars is. He is the one and only supreme master for me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two of them leaned in close to each other, creating an atmosphere as if they were about to start kissing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki intervened from the side and tore the space between them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;P-Please forgive me! I'm sorry for interrupting your good mood!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're still here, pervert woman. We're going to go back to our room and make love even more, so it would be nice if you could read the atmosphere and go somewhere else. How about in the ground there? The soil is soft and easy to dig in.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia threw the pickaxe she was holding towards Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike Malus, Lilia really had no reason to go help Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was insulted. First impressions were the worst.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Now that Lilia knew that Zerius was trying to snatch Mars' achievements, her second impression of Zerius was even worse.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rather than going to help such a person, it would obviously be more meaningful to go back to their room and make out with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-More importantly, if what you say is true, please come with me! We might still be able to bring him back now!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#8213;&#8213;More importantly? I don't want to hear those words. To us, that male is like a termite nesting in a tree. The world would be a much better place if he were gone. Right, Master?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I wouldn't go that far. ...... &#8213;&#8213;Say, Hazuki-chan, do you like that guy?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-that has something to do with it now. ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's motivation. It's not that I wouldn't help you if you liked him. This is this, that is that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's not that I have a tendency to want other people's things, but it was a factor that excited me a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;The fact that Hazuki was more lascivious than I thought was another factor that bothered me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I feel like I want to make her fall in love with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If you're going to make a friend, it's better to make them like you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;In addition to that, I also think that Hazuki should not be with Zerius</span>, thinking calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If she follows a man who is recklessly going forward without thinking about the future, she surely lose her life sooner or later. In fact, there was no denying the possibility that Zerius might even take her life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Regardless of how Hazuki answered, it was already certain that he would help her now that he had revealed himself, but he wanted to ask her a few questions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fact that Hazuki still followed Zerius after being beaten up so badly suggests that her feelings for Zerius were quite strong.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fact that they met in a local world without the internet is definitely a sign of fate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If that's the case, it's better for her to be with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even Mars knows that it's never a good idea to judge people's choices based on one's own criteria. But he still feels like he wants to stop a girl who is about to go down a bad path.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-there was a time when I thought I liked him a little bit, but now...... he beats me and kicks me every day,...... But I do have a little bit of feeling for him, and the thought of him dying,...... F-for the time being, we're in a relationship,......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Got it. But It's Hazuki-chan who I'll help. He's just a bonus. &#8213;&#8213;Is that okay with you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked down and grinned a little.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">That's just plain rude. ...... But it seems to work for this woman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Hazuki nodded with a big smile, Lilia felt a little depressed that she would have to teach her the hierarchy from now on. The best thing about Mars is that next to him is her place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;All right, let's go. &#8213;&#8213;But still, aren't the guards here too unmotivated? There's no one here. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The monsters from the lower layers might come up here. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;All they do is steal wages ...... Humans are foolish after all.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, let's just say it's convenient for us and go through with it. &#8213;&#8213;You might seriously die from here, so stay close to me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The three of them talked in secret by the one and only staircase to the lower layer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No one was around, and there was no reason to sneak around at all, but they were reading the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Normally, there would be soldiers guarding this place, but right now there were none.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In a dungeon, there is always one place where you can go down to the lower layers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Each time you go down, the number of monsters and their threat level increases.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars proceeded slowly forward, hitting the ground with his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dark stairs seemed to be trying to suck Mars and the others into the depths of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Worried&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A little ......, but if Master says it's okay, then it must be okay. I know you well enough to know that you were not a man who does reckless things.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The Mars that Lilia knows is the type of person who crosses over stone bridges. She knows that he has a character that seems to be appropriate but is quite detail-oriented.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, um, if Mars-san is a treader, does that mean you were very rich?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At Hazuki's words, both Mars and Lilia had a <span style="font-style: italic;">uwaa</span> look on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was slightly taken aback by Hazuki's boldness to ask something that even Lilia, who was accompanying him, had not asked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No? I've donated a lot of money. There are many places that don't benefit from the dungeon economy. Like the village where I grew up. I donated it to those places. It's no use for me to have so much. &#8213;&#8213;Are you disappointed?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-no.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki gives me a look of disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">This girl really...... has no restraint. I'm going to fuck you, you know?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I like that about you, Master. In the first place, there is no need to indulge in luxury. Just receiving the blessings of the forest and spending time peacefully with the one you love is more than enough for life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia felt this way from the bottom of her heart. If you have someone to walk with you, money is not always necessary. In the first place, the elves are from a different world than the human world, and capitalism, which is dominated by money, is not something they are familiar with.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We're supposed to be poor and pure. &#8213;&#8213;But I still buy clothes. I buy clothes because I like to dress up Lilia. It's already a hobby now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If that's what Lilia wants, I'll do whatever she wants.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars donated most of the money, leaving only a little money.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Not in cash, but mostly in the form of groceries, clothes, etc., which were sent directly to those who wanted to help. Otherwise, it would surely it will be hollowed out. The ethics of the modern world were the same as in his previous life, so I thought it would be even worse in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he bought things, he went to small merchants and bought things directly from economically weak areas, paying more than the market price.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Many of the families engaged in agricultural work were poor. Mars was born and raised in a poor family, and he knew the hardships they faced.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He thought it was a hypocritical activity, but it was a better use of the money than he had.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He used to poke fun at the act of donation, but now Mars doesn't make fun of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The gap between the rich and the poor is unusually large in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is no exaggeration to say that the world of the rich and the poor is different.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The first thing Mars did after conquering the dungeon was to do charity work. What he got was big, but there was nothing he wanted in it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Initially, he walked through the dungeon illuminated by torches, but halfway through, Lilia used magic to light the way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars can also use magic, but he relied on tools as much as possible to conserve his magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you doesn't have any greed...... I thought &#12304;Dungeon Adventurer&#12305; would be more lustful. ...... Everyone was making a fuss about money, money, treasure, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'm bare(?) with Lilia, though. That's what I want.&#12301;<span style="font-style: italic;">[リリアには剝き出しだけどね&#12290;俺が欲しいのは&#12289;そういうのなんだ]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-Is this mating ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Too straightforward ...... She's a pervert after all, isn't she?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was blushing sullenly, but her gaze was slightly downward, glancing at Mars' crotch area.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;What can I say ...... She's true to her instincts in many ways. ......</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Isn't she more pervert than me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-chan. You're lewd. Pervert. Even though you look so innocent.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-T-T-that's not true, okay!? I'm not interested in those hard things at all!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">She says it looks hard. ...... Is hard an important factor for women?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">Lilia often says she likes it hard, too. ...... Thank God, my things it's surprisingly hard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;"I want to mate with you, too," You were ranting and raving, weren't you? You were miserable and most unfortunate. &#8213;&#8213;Master made love to me very hard after that, though, didn't he? I was so happy and felt so good, you know? He told me he loved me, and I felt the most exquisite sexual sensations as my brain was melted. Humans, for example, should be able to shallowly pick at their genitals like that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is a little surprised by Lilia's sarcastic remark.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm getting a strong feeling that she's more possessive than I thought?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Li-Lilia? Don't you hate humans too much?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm jealous. ...... I wish I could have someone do that to me while telling me they love me. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With both hands between her cheeks, Hazuki said with a mellow look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You like cock too much, Hazuki-chan. If you say too much, I'll have to force it into you, all right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though it was a declaration of rape, Hazuki didn't look displeased at all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had been defending Hazuki, but now he realized how appropriate Lilia's word "pervert" was.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#8213;&#8213;Cock? What's a cock?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a male organ. A man is called a cock or dick, and a woman is called a pussy. Don't you know anything about that? You're a pervert woman, but you're stupid. No, you are stupid because you are a perverted woman.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I know what a pussy is because I heard it yesterday! In the first place, I-I was in an environment where I didn't know anything about such things, so it can't be helped. ......! The Tomb Guard's clan only knows the information around the canyon!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Sorry, both of you ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's my hobby, so it's not necessarily common, or maybe nobody knows about it in this world. ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I mean, Lilia, you're a casual know-it-all ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Now that I've revealed myself, let's show the two of you what's inside the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;. If there's anything you want, you can take it. Some of them aren't mine, so just give me a shout. I'd like to know what kind of stuff there is.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though it's Ma-Mars-san' magic, there are things that aren't yours?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. Maybe, but that thing has been used by someone before. It's a hand-me-down, so to speak.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;He-hee ......? I don't understand, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki put a finger to her lips and nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The magic that Mars has acquired, the &#12304;Treasure House of Dream&#12305;, is cloud storage that anyone with the access key of magic can access freely, Mars believes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At present, he is the only one using it. There are no signs of anyone else coming in or out lately.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There were mainly weapons and armor, but there were also some medicines.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As for the medicines, the creepy factor won out, so he left most of them there.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Also, the charge of embezzlement of found property came to Mars' mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He knew he shouldn't care now that he had brought the dungeon's treasure packed in the treasury, but he felt a little guilty about the items that clearly belonged to someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked at Mars and said seriously but in a cool voice.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The dungeon itself is a mystery. It's obviously an artifice of someone. I've heard that they've been around for a long time. And when the elves say a long time ago, they really mean a long time ago. The fact that the treasure is on the lowest layer is also very meaningful. It's as if they're trying to lure humans to them.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia, I'm sure you're right. Sorry to bring up &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;, but I couldn't find any of the party that was supposed to have gone down there before me.&nbsp;I think they're dead under the circumstances, but there were nobodies. I think they were eaten by a dungeon, not a monster. I don't know how to put it, but I think it's a creature called a dungeon, this here.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In Mars' perception, it's like a giant butterflyfish.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It feeds on treasure and lures people in to eat them. Mars thought that monsters were like parasites in a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's that, scary ......, t-then Zerius and the others are also ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If they were dead, they might have been eaten. The raw material for the treasure could be from dead adventurers. Normally, it would be in the possession of the guy who came in.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's better that way. If it's a treasure, at least the humans will appreciate it. It would be more meaningful than having those termites alive.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-You doesn't have to go so far as to say that ...... Zerius has some good points, too, all right? Of course, nowadays, swords and armor are more important than mine. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Where exactly? I have no idea.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's see... ...... his face ...... or something like that?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I wonder about that.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Zerius wasn't quite likable from the start, this is.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;No, is this what love is like for a girl this age?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;She's about a high school student, so is it any wonder that she's more concerned with looks than substance?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;As for the female mind, even after being reincarnated, I still don't understand it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's a bit unsympathetic, but maybe that's just the way it is</span>, and Mars stops thinking about it.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm a little bit like that myself.&nbsp;I can't help but notice the cute and erotic girls and want to help them even if they have nothing to offer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even his face is a face you can find anywhere.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia couldn't quite remember Zerius' face. She didn't even look at him. She had no interest in him at all. She could only grasp him as a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;H-He looked so cool at first, you know. But now I'm not so sure. ...... But other negative factors are too great.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My master, Mars is my favorite face. He is very cute with a little bit of youth in him. I especially like his face when he's having sex. I especially like the way he clings to me and is all throbbing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah, I know what you mean. Mars-san has a little bit of a cute face.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Don't do that, it's too complicated. First of all, let's go inside the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Cool is nice, but cute is subtle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;The fact that I have an adult perspective makes my face look young, but it's embarrassing when a third party says it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars opens the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305; and leads them inside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black hole with a vague edge made Hazuki look fearful, but Lilia entered easily. The difference in their level of trust in Mars had come to the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wooow ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Lilia and Hazuki saw was a square space that had the calm appearance of a library.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was about the size of a large apartment building, and except for three doors, there were no visible walls of shelves. Things are lined up here and there.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In this space, time doesn't move forward. Or, to be more precise, the time of things does not advance. I like the idea of food not deteriorating. But I'm scared. If time moves differently, it's no different than being in another world. Moreover, there are signs that someone has been using it. I don't feel very safe. I might not be able to get out.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-when you say that there is an unfathomable fear. ...... It's like being kicked out of the world, that kind of fear.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars came to this world through reincarnation, so he knows that there are other worlds. That is why his fear is greater than Lilia's.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">As long as I can come and go, it's fine. But what if I can't?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;The more I thought about it, the scarier I felt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars looked unusually serious, Lilia smiled in the opposite direction and took Mars' hand.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But if it's just you and me, you won't be lonely even if you can't leave. If worse comes to worst, we can both rot in here, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you sure? We don't have to die together, you know? Besides, if we're stuck here, we'll die of starvation. It'll probably be painful.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia replied without pause. There was nothing to hesitate about.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course. Still, I think it would be a better end than surviving alone.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then, I'll take your word for it. &#8213;&#8213;I'm so happy. I never thought I'd be happy. ...... I'm going to cry.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">There's no point in being scared, is there?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I've even been reincarnated. Maybe nothing will change.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And even if I die, I won't be alone this time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hoee. ...... Amazing, amazing ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She doesn't have a good vocabulary, does she, that pervert woman? Does she have ants in her brain?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She looks like she can study well. ...... Maybe it's just her looks. There is one person in the class who seems to be able to study very well but can't.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki may look plain, but she looks like a black-haired, neat, chairwoman-like girl who can study well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Mars knows that looks are not proportional to academic ability.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't know about that,...... but her level of magic seems to be high, and I guess she's not inherently stupid,...... though I don't want to admit it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Magic is a difficult thing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From Mars' perception, it's similar to memorizing a small mathematical formula and writing it from scratch yourself. And the numbers vary depending on the magic used.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If it is advanced, it is almost like trying to figure out what is called a mathematical conundrum, something that can be proven by multiple pages.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Magic in this world is magic, but it is science. It's just that its component, magic, was not present in his previous world, and it is fundamentally based on logic.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;C-Can I bring this with me, too!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh......Do you want that raggedy cloth ......? I-If you don't have money, do you want me to buy you a new cute outfit when we get out ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Hazuki brought from the shelf was a brown cloth that looked like rags.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was something that had been placed randomly in the corner of the shelf, almost unnoticed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">It was probably a cleaning product</span>, Mars thought. It was such a dirty brown rag.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I can't believe she wants something like this .......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I guess she grew up in a tough family,.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars narrowed his eyes and gave Hazuki a look of heartfelt pity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's with all the pity!? Y-you're wrong, geez! This is real magical armor! And it's extremely rare and expensive! It can't be made with today's technology!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;H-Hee.......What kind of garbage is that?&#12288;...... I can at least sew you a rag, okay? I've done it before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wh-What garbage! This is a &#12302;Robe of Flowing&#12303; that has been embedded with a wind technique. To be more specific, if you use this robe you can fly a little! I don't mean fly, but float!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">This brown rug is ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm curious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Seriously?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm really serious.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've heard of it. I mean, that's an elven invention. As that pervert woman said, it's also a lost technology. This is one of the weaknesses of elves, but because they live so long, they tend to neglect to pass on their skills. They tend to rely on the skills of one person.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I guess OOPArt exists in this world, too. [TLN: I think OOPArt is Out-of-place Artifact?]</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;In fact, there are more of them in this world?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's a world where transmission technology is analog. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you want it, fine. But can you use it? It's worn out.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I don't know. ...... I've never seen the real thing before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, whose knowledge is limited to what she hears in rumors, looks even more troubled than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia then took the &#12302;Robe of Flowing&#12303; from Hazuki's hand, observed it, and handed it back again, saying.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's no problem. If you have even a part of it, it will work. It doesn't matter what size it is. It looks like it's been cut off quite a bit, too. That's why the edges are so ragged.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hee, ...... it's kind of high-tech.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Is this itself a magic formula?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I've seen it as a magic weapon or something, but if you think about it, the basic structure is probably similar to having a CPU on board.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I thought it was a backward world of science, but maybe it's just progressing in a different vector than what I think it is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I should wear them?&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I-I'm wearing something embarrassing! It's clear and transparent!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm not talking about that one, I'm talking about this one. &#8213;&#8213;I knew it, you were a pervert, didn't you? Don't you need anything, Lilia?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars turned back to Lilia when he saw Hazuki blushing and holding her skirt from fluttering as if she misheard that she was wearing high-tech clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. Clothes and equipment that Master bought directly are more important than unknown things.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia clung to Mars and looked contemptuously at Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It-It's like I'm the bad guy for wanting something new. ......? I've been called a pervert many times. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's not true. But you know what? I think it's more pleasing for a man to have a reaction like Lilia's. It's cute. The fact that she is modest makes me want to give her more.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He doesn't know if there is such a thing in this world, but if there is such a thing as a cabaret club, Lilia is a gem that can reach the very top.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although she doesn't ask for anything, she responds very honestly and favorably to gifts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars wanted to see her face, so he gave her a gift.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In his previous life, he had also made fun of this behavior, but now Mars completely understood what it felt like to be a tribute man.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Just because you're cute doesn't mean you'll get tribute, Hazuki.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay. Then let's get out of here and quickly go to the lower layers. Make sure you don't get separated from me. I'll lead the way to avoid traps. Oh, also don't forget to use the &#12302;Body Strengthening&#12303; magic.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The most standard magic in this world is &#12302;Body Strengthening&#12303; magic.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Simply put, it's magic that uses magic power to raise your physical abilities, and it's low-grade magic that almost anyone can use.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-trap is it? I wonder what kind of traps are there ...... I just followed along, so I don't know much about them. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, yeah. There's a lot of stuff in the lower layers, like arrows that fly when you step on the trap and pits full of spears. Here, in the upper layer, all of the traps are almost completely destroyed.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From Mars' point of view, these traps are scarier than monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;You can deal with monsters, but if you're not careful with traps, it's over.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If it's just him, Lilia and Hazuki are still in danger, so Mars decides to lead the way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In that case, let's put this pervert woman in the lead. There is practically no damage.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia-san!? Don't you hate me too much!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's not that I hate you, it's that I hate humans. They have a short lifespan, and yet they dare to lay waste to this world with their own face.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's face had returned to the one she had when Mars had just met her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, she had turned her cold face and voice to Mars as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars could understand a little of how she felt. The human is a creature that did not change even if the world changed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master, may I have a word?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmm? What's up?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia spoke as if she remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think, given the fact that I'm a slave, doesn't this pervert woman have a higher standing than me? Even though she is a pervert woman. Regardless of our current situation, once we conquer the dungeon and get out, wouldn't we look like a party of elven slaves and men and women in society? Even though she is a pervert woman&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. ...... Lilia is right. Even though she is a pervert woman&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-You say "pervert" too much! Did you become addicted to saying "pervert" at the end of words!? M-Maybe I'm a little pervert, but!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">A little?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Mars both thought the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But it couldn't be helped, could it? At least I don't think of Lilia as a slave.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;R-right, even if you say that all of a sudden. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... You, become Master's slave. That will solve everything. I mean masters and their slaves. Also, I don't mind. Being a slaveholder's slave is another thing. Fortunately, I am familiar with slave magic. I learned it because it was used on me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pointing her finger firmly, Lilia pronounced with dignity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The look on Lilia's face when she turned to Hazuki was completely evil.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars wondered if he should stop her, but there was nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He doesn't feel like treating either Hazuki or Lilia as slaves. Besides, somewhere along the line, he had thought about taking Hazuki from Xerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was confident that he could make Hazuki happier than he was.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And slaves, although the word sounds unhealthy, are quite safe depending on their masters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-become a sex slave!? I-I don't want to!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't worry. I will continue to monopolize sexual services. In the first place, I did not ask you to be a sex slave. What do you expect? ...... Totally pervert, aren't you? All you do is take care of your surroundings, take care of all the miscellaneous hassle.&nbsp;You can be used as a shield for traps or to attract monsters. Also, let me think.......There is no specific meaning, but would you like to chain iron balls to your arms and legs and drag them?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd rather not do that! A-After all, m-maybe I don't mind serving so much ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She's pervert, I guess&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, she's pervert&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm not a pervert!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The three of them went down to the lower layer, asking and answering dirty questions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To the casual observer, there was not the slightest hint of tension.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the other hand, the person in the lower layer was different.</p>
