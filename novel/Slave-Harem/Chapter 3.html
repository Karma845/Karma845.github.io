<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;But still, there are no demons outside the village, are there? The forest in the village is more exciting than this.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the square, there are only people in a hurry. There are only a few demons to be encountered every once in a while, and even when they do appear, they are quickly vanquished and destroyed, so you are as safe as you can be.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The lower layers are often frequented by mercenary soldiers and adventurers. Are there that many demons in the area where Lilia lived?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. After all, elves live in the forest. There are many animals besides demons. That's one of the reasons why the elves have a certain level of fighting ability. But because of their longevity, many of them are more laid back than humans.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In the village I was in, it happened about two or three times a year. Mostly during the change of seasons.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fufu, it's like a cold, isn't it ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The demons they encountered after entering the dungeon were all things that could be considered small animals, even if they were monsters in the category. He didn't want to kill them, so he just drove them away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only thing they don't like is the giant worms that come out when they are digging in the walls. They are as thick as a human arm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The faction of demons known as dungeon worms is a subsistence species.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are not harmful, but they are simply disgusting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, with his modern values, was not comfortable with killing living things, even demons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He could only kill demons that were obviously too dangerous to be left alone or demons that looked like insects.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As the two of them were digging through the wall in their routine work, the silver-haired man from earlier, Zerius, spoke to them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hah! You've been talking so much bravado to me, and all you're doing is picking up rocks?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius still has the same arrogant attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was amazed at how hard he could be so strong when exposed to such an ugly attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Not again, Pudding-san. What are you doing here? I mean, I thought you were here to capture the dungeon. Why are you on the lower layers again?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pudding is ...... that demon!? That red, slimy stuff!? I don't want to be associated with that thing!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah, that's what it's called. ...... I always thought it was slime. It was so different from the one in the game that I was surprised. It's just too big.&#8213;&#8213;I'm talking about the pudding, the one with the jello friend.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The pudding that Zerius is talking about is a red, squishy, jelly-like monster that can be found between grass and rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They move slowly and look like strawberry-flavored jelly moving around.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Despite its appearance, it is a vicious, carnivorous monster that grows by dissolving the prey it takes into its body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you touch it unexpectedly, it will melt you, so even adventurers with a certain amount of experience are constantly being victimized.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;D-don't talk nonsense! Anyway, I'm asking if you're playing with rocks after making me look like a horse and a fool!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, you know. Our purpose today is to earn money for living in the lower layers. You're the one who came here to conquer dungeons, aren't you? &#12302;Thunder&#12303;-san, who conquered &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;? Did you sincerely apologize to that girl?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars said sarcastically.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The way the girl had been treated earlier came to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;H-Hmph! That's my woman, so it's none of your business! We'll see how it goes today!&#12288;I'm still a cautious person!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hou. You're really looking for a sponsor, aren't you? You're trying to make a good impression on the nobles here at the lower layers, and get them to give you the money and resources you need to dive to the bottom. But since you can't do much here, so you're bored and messing around with us. Isn't that right? Isn't that what you were promoting earlier, tangling with us?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-Th-Th-That's not true! I'm trying to conquer Ganymede, you know!? I have money! and I have an achievement, too!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;He's so flustered and confused. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius seemed to be a terrible liar, and he responded with a clear rasp in his voice, his eyes swimming.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was not uncommon for adventurers like Zerius to think they were relying on others for funds and manpower.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In order to complete a dungeon conquer that could take days to complete, a certain amount of supplies and manpower are needed. It is difficult for a single adventurer to have all of these things. That is the reality, and they have no choice but to ask those who have it to provide it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The aristocrats who fund the dungeons do not want to conquer the dungeons themselves. What they want is what they can get in the dungeon, and they will never risk their own lives for it. Even if the world is different, they all share the same idea that life is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why the aristocrats let others do it. They invest their money in those who have the ability and receive what they get. In addition to that, they can get some honor to talk about in social circles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The better the material you get, the more the rich want to invest in it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is how the "labyrinth city" was born.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even in a world where magic exists, it is no different from Mars' previous life in that people's greed drives the world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ze-Zerius. Stop, okay? Wh-Why are you going to make enemies like that? W-We're all adventurers, so why don't we just cooperate with each other?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black-haired girl called out as if it was very difficult to say, and grabbed Zerius' arm. She looked frightened as if she could not forget the beating she had just received.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She looked frightened, which made Mars feel even more unhappy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't you dare interrupt me, Hazuki! Do you want to get hit again!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm sorry. B-But&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I gave you special permission to accompany me because you wanted to go with me, the one who will be the one to break through dungeons. I've even given you the honor of being my woman. So don't interfere with what I do!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius drew his sword and thrust it at the black-haired girl called Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sword was electrified. It must hurt a lot just to touch it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The entire frustration of Zerius conversation with Mars was directed at the dark-haired girl, Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eeekk......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Come on, if you have something to say, say it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The wounds on the girl's face had been completely healed by the healing spell. There were no more traces of bleeding. But because Hazuki could heal herself, Zerius had lost his resistance to hitting Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius' mind was not at ease.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, he was certainly bored. He hadn't had much of a reason to set eyes on Mars, because he had an elf with him, an eye-catching presence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was just a good way to make his presence known. As Mars said, he wanted a noble sponsor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Mars didn't do what he wanted, and he was even humiliated.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No one wants your opinion! If you're going to say anything else, I'll cut you down in front of those monsters!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I got it! I-I'm not going to say anything more!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Once Hazuki is gone, they won't need as many supplies as Hazuki does. Zerius had an idea that the current supplies might be enough.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It takes money to conquer a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Weapons, equipment, food, torches, money for hiring companions, and other miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The basic premise is that funds are necessary for a reliable attack. It's impossible to prepare all of these things on your own. If he could, he wouldn't be an adventurer and would be living in luxury.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius is impatient. He wants to get the results of his attack as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This impatience became irritation, and it was directed at the people around him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki trembled with a frightened expression and dropped the small staff in her hand to the ground. Lilia stared at the fallen staff from behind Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's frightened demeanor intensified, and a pathetic look appeared on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's body knew exactly what to do when Zerius was angry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was not the way Mars wanted things to go, not when he was the one responsible for harming a strange woman.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't do that. That girl has nothing to do with this. Come on, I'm gonna be pissed too, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Huh! The kid's angry, so what?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're gonna die. You have no right to complain when I kill you in the dungeon. Well, you're dead, so you can't say. Dead men tell no tales.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Huh? What are you talking about? You're the one? Kill me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars put his hand on his sword with a straight face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The air was suddenly tense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was Lilia who made the first move on the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;*swoosh!*</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After the sound of the vines bursting and cutting the hollow, there was the sound of metal clashing with metal.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the sound of an arrow hitting the shoulder strap of Zerius' white armor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a straight line of scars on the top of the shoulder protection.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Termites. I won't allow you to wreak any more havoc. Next time, I'll shoot you in the neck. I'll tell you what, I won't miss unless I do it on purpose. &#8213;&#8213;I'm willing to overlook the worst of insults against me. But I will never allow you to insult my master.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The usual cute and cuddly expression of Lilia has changed, and there is an unmistakable hostility in her ice-blue eyes as she glares at Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Li-Lilia?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Tsk! &#8213;&#8213;Let's go, Hazuki!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;R-right! &#8213;&#8213;I'm sorry! He didn't mean any harm either!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;All right. It's not your fault, either way, so don't worry about it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who was walking behind Zerius, turned around and bowed to Mars and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;She's a very polite girl. She didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Handsome guy are not fair. I can't believe that girl can fall in love with a guy like that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm kind of tired......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right.........Why don't we take a break today? We've done more digging than we originally planned.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia said as she looked at the Magic Steel packed in her cloth sack bag.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There are enough for two bags here, so they can say that they have collected enough.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're right. We're going to be stuck in the dungeon until the evening tomorrow anyway, so we might as well take a break. Aren't you tired? At this pace, we'll be able to collect more tomorrow.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If that's the case, it's a little early, but let's have a quick dinner and "Get Along" until we're all tired and asleep. ......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a curious look on her face, Lilia traced her finger across her lower lip. Her pink lips and her white fingers are lustrous and dazzling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It feels good to be invited, Mars realized.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's an erotic way to put it. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've heard married women refer to their nightlife in that way. I read it in some book a long time ago.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After a brief battle, the blood flow in both of them had nowhere else to go, and the spiritual high led directly to sexual desire.</p>
<hr />
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They returned to their room at the inn, and as soon as they closed the door, they threw their bags on the floor and immediately began to embrace and kiss each other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When the tension left her body and the stiffness disappeared, she started to stick her tongue in, and they hugged each other tightly in the doorway.&nbsp;After a long, long kiss, they looked at each other, laughed a little, and decided to take a shower in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The shower was not big enough for both of them, so Lilia went in first, and after a while, she was switched with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' body was dirty with dirt and dust from digging in the walls.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;If you take a bath before you have sex, it's kind of exciting. ...... I've taken the trouble to prepare it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He glanced at the room from the bathroom and saw Lilia in her underwear, spreading out a new towel on the futon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since the inn was located in a dungeon, the facilities were basically a bit dirty. Lilia's maiden heart was beating out of her as she didn't want to use the same bedding as here.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia filled the entire room with the magic of estrus, without telling Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is magic that makes the body more sensitive and acute, and mentally exposes the true nature of the body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone in this space is like an animal in heat. If you have a partner, all you can think about is mating.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It feels great to have sex normally, but with this magic, it feels even better. In many cases, the climax is even accompanied by emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After trying it out, Lilia got a taste for it and began to use it from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though she was just waiting, Lilia's body was hot and her lower body was tingling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was looking forward to the return of Mars as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<i>I may be a little ...... immodest these days. But when Mars holds me, I feel ...... safe.</i></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's been a while since they started having intercourse, and their bodies have learned how to feel good after doing it every day.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As he sneaks a look at Lilia getting ready, Mars thinks it's even more erotic when there's a sense of life like this, and he hardens his crotch.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was on all fours with the towel spread out, and her plump, round buttocks occupied Mars' view.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was wearing a pair of underwear, but it was a very tight black string, and it cut into her cleft, revealing the lewd shape of her labia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black underwear looks great on her white skin.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<i>I knew it, the black underwear is suited Lilia very much........</i></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm glad I had it made, a T-Back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Only the upper part of her buttocks was covered, so most of her roundness was exposed and yielding. Mars learned after his reincarnation that sometimes it is more erotic to wear it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since then, he has been dressing Lilia in various outfits and shaking his hips like crazy. His young body quickly recovered from the fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars hurriedly washed up and wiped his body thoroughly with a towel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he knew that he would be sweaty afterward, he wanted the feel of his bare skin touching each other. The dampness of the water was just a hindrance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master, I'm ready ......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who was on all fours, turned around and met the eyes of Mars, who was peeking out from the bathroom while wiping his body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia waved her hips from side to side to appeal to Mars as if she were trying to provoke him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you're sp erotic......! I can do this all night long.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm also feeling excited today ...... &#9825; because Master was so cool during the day &#9825;&#12301;<br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars attacked Lilia on all fours and covered her, gently lifting and squeezing her breasts, which were wrapped in black underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The whole area is cool, but only the lower breast is moist, sweaty, and warm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even through her underwear, he can see the poke and protrusion at the tip of her breasts, which catches on his fingers and adds the perfect accent to his rubbing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;This is the ...... weight of this pointy thing, I can't get enough of it. ......!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What's in it!?</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Heavy marshmallow!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nnahh.....&#9825; You only touch my breast.........If you don't kiss me, I won't let you have intercourse, okay? &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With Mars covering her, Lilia rolled over, turned her head to the side, and grabbed Mars' face with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two of them again make an <span style="font-style: italic;">*slhp-slhp*</span> sound as they extend their tongues to each other in a moist exchange of saliva.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia seemed to like the completely supple kiss so much that she voluntarily extended her tongue and guided it so that it would be easy for Mars to intertwine it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had learned from his previous actions that Lilia's ears were particularly sensitive, so while kissing her, Mars supported his weight with both elbows and his fingers reached out and stroked her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's ears were long and pointed upward, but they were softer than they looked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They plump back to their original shape when he plays with his fingers, and they feel very smooth to the touch.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he let go of his mouth and blow in her ear, Lilia cowered and began to shake.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You know, it's a little embarrassing, but from now on, there are a few words I want you to say with my words. I also want you to do something for me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's voice became thin and high-pitched as her breasts were squeezed under the mars and her ears were stimulated.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Haah, haah.....&#9825; I'll do, nnhhh, anything, I can to, ahh, make you happy, be-because I'm Master's, ahh, sex slave, nnghh, Nnahh&#9825; Nnhhh......M-My ears,,,,!&#9825; Ahh, ahhh....&#9825;&#8213;&#8213;I-I'm gonna cum&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia sometimes utters words that sound like lewd words. But they were like words in a health textbook, and Mars thought they were not exciting enough.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had thought about her not saying it until the distance between them had shortened, but he decided it was time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was more of a light cumming than a real cumming, Mars thought.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This kind of light cumming is quite common.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's always the case that Lilia's hips slacken and she becomes exhausted after repeated light climaxes from caresses, leading to the insertion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he inserted it after making her cum, her pussy was covered in her love juices, and her loosened vaginal flesh was sucking on his cock.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It felt incredibly good to thrust his hips into the tight and slippery part of Mars' cock, pushing it back and forth without question or hesitation. It was so stimulating that when he was a little pent up, he would ejaculate just from penetration.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;*Twitch-twitch* As if to hide the shaking, red-faced Lilia from the world, Mars supported her weight with his elbow, secured the freedom of his hands, and stroked her head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Dropping her body, he could feel her breasts, which excited him. The soft, squishy, crushing touch is the best.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars supports his weight with one of his arms and puts one hand between Lilia's closed thighs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He stroked the cool, smooth, hairless flesh and slowly slid his hand down to the crotch so that Lilia could feel it well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he brought his fingers to her pussy, Lilia closes her knees as if to resist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But when he breathed into her ear, she reflexively opened her legs, and Mars took advantage of the opportunity to advance his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I want you to say "sex" instead of "intercourse" next time.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;O-Okay, ahh, ahhh!&#9825; Th-That's so lewd! &#9825; Aahhh, it's here, Mars' hand is on my vulva! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is a pussy, not a vulva. I think mine should be a cock or a penis.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aaahhhhh!&#9825; &#8213;&#8213;My pussy, my pussy was touched, aahhh! &#9825; Aahhhh!&#9825; Your fingers were rubbing my pussy ...... Aahhhh! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia became more and more excited as she was forced to say words that were probably obscene.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z8CfsM1/00011.jpg" alt="00011" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even just after the climax, her sensitivity is tremendous.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah, yeah, something like that. You're still in your underwear, you know? You really have an erotic body. ...... It's already wet&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The panties, which were almost a string, were slick with the liquid that had been stained from Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars pulls a short, clear string as he lets go of his finger to let it float.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Flattered by the feeling, Mars moved his fingers along the crack, and&nbsp;he delicately press and stroked her clitoris with his fingertips over her panties.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's sweet gasping gasps increased Mars' sexual desire to the extreme.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;More, please touch my pussy more ......&#9825; I want you to lick my pussy ......&#9825;.&#12301;</p>
