<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm tired. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's only been about three hours since we left the treasury. ...... Can't you try a little harder? We're going to be away from Zerius and the others again.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Once you learn the luxury, you can't go back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's response was a perfect example of this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki glanced at Mars, her flirtatious eyes clearly expecting to see her enter the treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia frowned, even though it was a place that could not exist if it were an original dungeon attack.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You can't stand everything to everything...........don't you feel a little bit of guilt about it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Inwardly, Lilia, who is the least physically fit, would like to be in the treasury, but she will not say so because the situation is what it is.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The main difference between Hazuki and Lilia was that Hazuki would or would not act to restrain herself so that Mars would not hate her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmmm ...... We're good for about thirty minutes. Next time we won't go in for a while. Or when you get hurt.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-yes!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Hey, hey, aren't you tired?&#12301;</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The more Mars wonders, the happier Hazuki jumps and is excited around.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master ...... are you not a little lenient to that pervert woman?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Maybe. But Lilia is tired too, right? I can see it in your face. This is better than being loud and stressful. Lack of composure is transmitted not only to the mind but also to the whole body. That can be fatal. Then it's okay to take a break. I'm a little hungry too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is awkward(?) to be in a death march. Mars hated it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The objective is a cheerful and enjoyable dungeon crawl.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As someone who ultimately aims for a slow life, he would not expose his true humanity in such extreme situations.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After entering the treasury, Hazuki rushed to the bed and began to sleep on her stomach without saying a word.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems that fatigue itself was a fact.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I guess her my pace is cute. ...... Being able to keep your own pace means you're mentally strong.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;maybe she's simply rude?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's harsh words were met with nothing but a smile from Mars, who rolled up Hazuki's skirt as she slept and smiled as he checked the extreme underwear inside.</p>
<p class="calibre"><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After waking up, the three of them proceeded again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then they went down another layer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was only one type of monster on the floor, a large lion that attacked in packs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmmm ...... It feels weird. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What? In your head?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars asks with a laugh as Hazuki's mind wanders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's not!&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The frequency of encounters with monsters has changed. Much more often than before, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I-is Xerius and the others still alive?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I shouldn't say anything random. &#8213;&#8213;It may be suspicious. If we were tired, we'd be in danger, too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The hurdles are different even against the same monsters between Mars and his party, who are progressing with a margin of safety in every aspect, and Zerius and his party, who are pushing forward with a gut feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although he did not tell Lilia or Hazuki, this situation was due to Mars' cold calculation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From the beginning, he had planned to go down there with a predecessor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He did not say so because he felt he would be blamed if he did.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the same when he conquered &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He checked on those who had gone before him, and then he waited for a while before going down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason, of course, was to reduce the burden on himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he was in perfect condition, he would not feel defeated by any monster, but if he was exhausted and there were multiple monsters and traps involved, it was a different story. In that regard, if there is a preceding situation, the burden is definitely reduced, at least as far as the monsters are concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is the canary against toxic gas in the mine.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had no intention of helping Zerius and was proceeding with a feeling close to that of a fisherman's profit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, a seventeen-year-old boy, would not think of such a thing, but the man, a twenty-nine-year-old modern man, had such a thought process.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This situation, in which he was as good as having Hazuki in his hands, was also close to being a piece of cake off the shelf.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whether viewed as a woman or as a force to be reckoned with, Hazuki's impression was not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was too free, which was a little flawed, but he thought it was cute.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I know it's not something I'd say after betraying him, but ...... I'm&nbsp;worried.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'm not saying he's okay, but I'm sure he's alive. You might want to think about a goodbye line. I'm hoping for a lewd one.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">If you go on, you'll see. If we don't run into him, it means he's dead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;My guess is he's not alive. Because you can't conquer a dungeon with just a little strength.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whatever the prediction, Mars thought it would be better to keep it a tease.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Until now, there had been dead monsters on every layer, but he haven't seen any since they came to this layer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius and the others may be in the belly of a roaming lion monster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars has no taste for scaring girls, so he doesn't say a word.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;L-Lewd lines ...... I don't like Zerius' ugly dick ...... something like that?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's it! That's the kind of thing I'm expecting. &#8213;&#8213;For now, you should keep your head full of lewd though. And I want you to have my baby eventually.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A slow life in a harem state is not a bad idea.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As long as Lilia can live happily without feeling lonely, that's all that matters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's lewd words ......You mean the words that would make Mars-sama want to mate with me. ......Mmm, that's a hard one to say. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If it's like when you masturbate, I bet I'll go into a heat&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is enough to be shown in a slutty way. And since a sense of immorality is added to it, even Mars, as expected, did not feel like he could overcome his sexual desire.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had to be careful not to do it live, but he wasn't sure he could.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The temptation to do it just once was already on his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-Master, I thought you were not going to have sex with this pervert woman? I understand that there will be such things in the future, as long as you make her your slaves, but......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's voice was filled with worry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if he had to do it someday, she would still want him to be her only master.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars shook.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The temptation to insert was quite strong when he caressed Hazuki. If Lilia had not asked for it and had fallen asleep first, he would have surely inserted it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Reason tells him he needs a condom, but the male instinct tells him to push his semen deep inside Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The thing that drives him most sexually is that he is still not rejected.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you are told that you can impregnate them, you will want to impregnate them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The body of a seventeen-year-old is not patient enough to reject sexual desire.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I intend to ...... be patient. But I am a little worried. I think she has a strange sex appeal, or maybe I'm excited to be able to do things that Lilia can't do,.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I want you to think of me as a sexual processing tool. ...... your heart is for me and me alone. ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's okay. The only one I spoil is Lilia. Because that's what I live for.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though she is older in this world, Hazuki feels younger in many ways and does not have the embracing power as Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was something about spoiling Lilia that was like spoiling a mother.</p>
<p class="calibre"><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Huh. Something's wrong! There's a big hole!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki makes a commotion alone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki points to a large hole where about ten people can fit side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I knew it was a dungeon of the same type as &#12302;Ganymede&#12303;. I told you, didn't I?&#12288;That's the way to the bottom layer, in other words....&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Do you mean the root of the apex ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia said in a frightened tone as she took a step back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh, so the dungeon is already over!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a look of joy and impatience on her face, Hazuki spoke up and closed the distance to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, no, no, it's rather the real show now. To tell you the truth, I think with a little preparation and some strength, we can make it here. But no one has stepped through this dungeon yet. And the reason for that lies ahead.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon itself, according to Mars, is a bit of a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you have the right countermeasures and the right number of people, you can make it to the bottom layer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But the bosses are a different story.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Simple strength is required.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why Mars was acting with a plan to put all his strength into the boss.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Come on, you two, brace yourselves. You are more likely to die here than ever before. If I die by mistake, hurry back the way you came. You hear?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both Lilia and Hazuki gasp at Mars' words as he walks away with his sword drawn from the start.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the first time Mars showed a serious face with no room to spare when dealing with monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As they were about to descend the stairs, a high metallic sound echoed in their ears.</p>
<div class="start-9em">
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What the hell is this guy!? No matter how many times I cut it, it regenerates right away!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the lowest layer, near the center of the vast, empty floor, Zerius, a man in white armor, was fighting alone against the deformed figure in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The size of the floor was something that Zerius of this world had nothing to compare with.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was slightly larger than the size of a dome stadium in modern times.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The ceiling was as high as outside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Soon after the battle began, Zerius' companions stopped moving after the monster's rush.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no time to check, but Zerius judged that they were probably dead. They were that motionless.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was more powerful than any monster he had ever encountered. Its size is off the charts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was also a monster whose true identity was unknown to Zerius, who was not familiar with monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The monster was dozens of times larger than Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If it was to use an analogy, it was as tall as three large horse-drawn carriages stacked vertically and as wide as ten horse-drawn carriages lined up side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On top of its body, which was round like a bun with four thick legs, were seven long necks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At the end of each neck is the head of a snake, each of which moves as if it had an independent will.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It looked strange as if multiple long snakeheads had sprouted from a giant elephant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">Their cry is unpleasant. First of all, snakes are not creatures that cry, all right!?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The roar echoes across the floor rattled Zerius's nerves as each head cries in its own way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius, a tantrum-prone man by nature, reacts more strongly than the other humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius combined his swordsmanship and magic to cut off several heads, but there was nothing he could do in the face of the monster, which kept regenerating whether he cut it or not.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He attacked the main part of the body, but it was covered with hard scales and his blade could not stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The figure of Zerius, wearing white armor and wielding a sword as if dancing, was elegant and graceful, regardless of his personality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a unique sword technique handed down in the Zerius family, a sword that mainly focuses on defense, parrying the enemy's attack, and using its power to attack.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm tired. What should I do? My strength is decreasing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And the smell of this monster's breath ...... this is probably poisonous. I inhale a little, but I feel a numbing sensation in my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I've already lost all of my companions. I've left it to the others to recover from the poison, so recovery is hopeless now. I'm not good at that kind of support magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;With the end of the dungeon right in front of me, right in front of me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius gazes at the huge door behind the monster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A gorgeous golden door like a treasure room. It was clear that there was something he was looking for.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He could not open the door without ignoring the monster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For all its sluggish appearance, the monster moved fast.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The movement itself is simple; it just rushes toward Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But even a simple movement is nothing more than a threat if there is a difference in strength and physique.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If it stepped on him, his whole armor would be crushed and become a part of the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Am I, am I going to die here!? In a place like this, alone, without becoming anything!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He tried to avoid the onrushing monster, but he couldn't move from the knees down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Conscious of death, Zerius shouted loudly. No one responded to his empty howl.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I'm going to die. What have I done this for, what on earth have I done this for!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I have to be a hero!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I have to be special or no one will recognize me. ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Despite Zerius' will, his body was reaching its limits from the long march and battle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Moreover, he was unknowingly being poisoned by the monster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The entire floor, filled with the exhalations of the monster, was already under its spell.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Just before colliding with the monster, Zerius desperately held his sword in front of him and used it as a shield, but his resistance was in vain as he was blown away against the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Blown away so easily that it was not much different from dust in the air, Zerius slammed into a wall and lost consciousness in severe pain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The last thing that vaguely flashed through Zerius' mind was the image of Hazuki, who had silently followed him no matter how roughly Zerius had handled the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Damn. Was I wrong ......?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sound of Zerius' sword and armor striking the monster reached the ears of Mars and the two others above.</p>
