<h3>Afterwords</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, thank you for picking up this book.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nice to meet you, my name is Akari Hino, the author.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I personally am the type of person who starts reading from the afterword, so I'll try not to mention the contents of the main story here.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is my second work to be published in book form, and I've already run out of things to write about in this afterword. So I thought I would write a little about myself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, I once gave up on becoming a novelist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If I say that, you might imagine that I have been writing for quite a long time and have had various setbacks and failures, but let me tell you in advance that there is no such thing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I think it was around the spring of my sophomore year in high school that I decided I wanted to become a novelist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Incidentally, the period during which I had my heart set on it was probably around a month at most. The number of words I wrote during that time was zero. "You're not aiming for it anymore!" This is the level of the "I'm not a fan of this". Not even a three-day monk.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At that time I kind of, really kind of, wanted to do something other than getting paid. It could have been a mangaka, it could have been a day trader, it could have been a yin-on-yang master.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In short, I wanted to be someone special, but unfortunately, even if I wanted to be, I couldn't draw, I couldn't read charts, and I couldn't understand the Yin-Yang path.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then I thought maybe I could become a novelist (I'm really sorry ......) and set my sights on becoming a novelist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But my youthful exuberance was easily shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because of my ambition, I was a reasonably good reader at the time. But I only read during my commute to school. I went to high school by bus and underground, so I had a bit of time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was during those days that I became obsessed with the works of a certain author.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At first, I started with the manga, but before I knew it, I had started to devote my small amount of pocket money to following the works .......The process is as follows.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When I came across one of these authors works, I was convinced that I would never become a novelist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the afterword of the book, it was written that the author had won an award and made his debut as a high school sophomore at the age of 17, the same age as I was at the time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I was astonished. I was shocked and astonished. I had never imagined that there was someone my age who had reached the place I was trying to reach.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I was reading the book thinking that it was an interesting setting and that it was amazing that someone could write something like this, so I was quite shocked. That's what it feels like to have your scaffolding shaken. There was no foothold to shake.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;So I gave up the path of a novelist without writing a single word.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then, for some unknown reason, I started writing a novel and was approached by Shueisha, a company I admired as a reader, and here I am, writing an afterword. Moreover, the aforementioned author's debut was also by Shueisha. So I feel very honored. To be honest, I jumped up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But it was the readers on the web and those who are reading this book now that gave me this opportunity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I'd also like to thank the editors at Dash-X Bunko for bringing it to the world in such a way at such a difficult time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To the illustrator Neibi, I was so happy when I saw the illustration that I squealed with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;So, finally, once again, thank you very much for your time up to this point.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I look forward to seeing you again in the next volume.</p>
<p class="calibre"><br /></p>
