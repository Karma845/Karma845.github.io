<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Boy Trapped in Chains</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A school built in the school city of Arcazam, where young people from all over the continent of Arkmill gather to study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a place where students who do not achieve a certain level of performance are dropped without mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu Bountis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is a second-year student at Solminati Academy and belongs to the 10th grade, the lowest level in the merit-based school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the chest of his white-colored uniform, he wears a black nameplate that indicates his lowest grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slumbering in the late afternoon sun, he remembers the time when he first came to this school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was two years ago that he came to this school. He came to this school with his best friend to support the dream of the person he was in love with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa Hounds and Ken Nortice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa Hounds and Ken Nortice were childhood friends who had spent time together since they were children in their hometowns, and Lisa Hounds was a sweetheart with whom he had shared feelings before coming to this school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They first met when she moved with her mother to her hometown village of Oile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The village where Nozomu was born and raised was on the frontier of a small country that had friendly relations with a major power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The land was relatively fertile, so there was no need to worry about eating, but it was an ordinary farming village with little change in its daily life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was fishing in the river that flowed through the village, a girl who had just moved to the village approached him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's nice to meet you," she said. Are you free right now? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">It all started when Nozomu turned to look back at the girl who had called out to him, her voice hoarse and at a loss for words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-12"></a>She was a beautiful girl with short reddish hair, dressed in a beautiful one-piece dress. Her eyes, which were filled with a winning temperament but trembled with nervousness, were like jewels that caught the young Nozomu's attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My own face gradually heated up, and my heart beat fast. It was completely love at first sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yeah, I'm free at ......, right? In case are you lose.....?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm so glad you're here. Well, let's have a little chat! I'm Lisa Hounds, nice to meet you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so begins an exchange between two young people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They exchanged words as they were surrounded by the murmuring of the stream flowing on the riverbank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  originally  traveled  with  her  adventurer  parents,  but  after  her  father  died,  she  apparently returned to this village, her mother's hometown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of her many travels, Lisa's communication skills were better than those of boys and girls her age. Nozomu talks about this village, and Lisa tells him where she has been and what she has done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So you're an adventurer. ...... What kind of places have you been? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adventurer. As the name implies, they are those who explore the unknown and open up uncharted lands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who lives in a peaceful village, has no connection to this story. However, as a young boy who yearned for tales of heroism and adventure, Lisa's story intrigued him greatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that the speaker was someone he had fallen in love with at first sight was also a reason why he was so absorbed in her story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so they lost track of time in their first encounter and talked until the sun went down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  relationship  began  as  young  friends.  It  was  around  the  time  when  they  both  reached  the second stage of adulthood that their relationship took a major turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu began to grow taller and Lisa's body was gradually approaching that of a woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to the Solminati Academy. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">She told me this with a hint of nervousness, just as she had done when we first met her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same as leaving the village where Nozomu and his friends had spent their lives. Nozomu was fascinated by the sight of the girl he had fallen in love with, but he was also frustrated by the fact that she, whom he had been attracted to since childhood, was leaving the village. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then i'm coming with you ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu found himself impulsively uttering such words. </p>

<a href="https://ibb.co/mXtbLw9"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/BrjcXxy/000003.jpg" alt="000003" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Hearing Nozomu's words, Lisa's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking about? Nozomu is going to live in this village, isn't he? Even uncles and aunts ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's family is a farmer, but he is the only child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Nozomu was a valuable and indispensable worker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His father, in particular, would be very much against it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If the girl I love wants to fulfill her dreams, I want to help her." </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-14"></a>whaa ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's wide-open eyes and face are filled with confusion, and she speaks out in bewilderment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, while her expression reflected her dismay, her cheeks were tinged with vermilion that could not be hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, is head-over-heels in love with her, having spoken of his long-held feelings, but he is determined to support her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,......, I'm so happy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa, perhaps moved to tears, gently pulls herself closer to Nozomu's chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They both put their hands behind each other's back, their lips naturally ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dream ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bell, signaling the end of lunch break, pulls Nozomu back from her dream to reality. Nozomu picks  himself  up,  brushes  the  grass  off  his  uniform,  and  heads  to  his  classroom  to  attend  his afternoon classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vow he once made to her. The fact that he can no longer fulfill it is forcibly dismissed from his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">- </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  meritocracy  of  the  Solminati  Academy,  differences  in  rank  are  a  clear  indicator  of  the difference between one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This academy was established with loans from the countries of the Ark Mill continent after the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Great Invasion" that occurred 20 years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless of birth or status, if a student is able to rise to a higher rank, they will be able to train in a suitable environment, and by the time they graduates, they is guaranteed to be a prosperous man or woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if one falls to a lower rank, they will receive criticism from those who were originally higher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to mention the treatment of those who were originally lower in rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In such a school, Nozomu belongs to the 10th grade, the lowest rank in the school year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he walked down the corridor, he was met with a nonchalant, inorganic gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The hell, that dropout is still here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surprisingly, I thought he already left school long ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words of mindless, dry indifference directed at me. In this academy, where competition is fierce, students have no time to pay attention to those who are lower than themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-15"></a>Even if they did, their voices and gazes would be tinged with unconscious contempt and ridicule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this is still better than nothing. When Nozomu entered the classroom, the air felt clammy and sticky on his skin. A dark, amused gaze is directed at him. Ignoring the stares, Nozomu went to his seat, where malicious words had been carved with a knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Get out!, A disgrace to the school. A loser and a lesser shit.’ </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu glanced around, some of the students turned to look at him with a smirk on their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the looks on their faces, it was obvious who had ripped up Nozomu's desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They giggled and chuckled as they watched Nozomu shush and sit in his tattered seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tenth-grade students have no position in this school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it is not as if they are lazy; they are talented young people who would be called prodigies back in their home, and they have worked hard to deserve it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in this academy, where the best and brightest from all over the continent are gathered, their brilliance is overshadowed by the brilliance of others who are stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solminati Academy's class-based system is designed to stimulate students' competitive spirit and encourage their growth to a higher level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this system that expects total achievement also has its downsides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below a certain level, students are completely demoralized and drop out without mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because competition is so intense, people expect rewards and compliments from others, and those who make it to the top gain some kind of special sense of superiority. Conversely, those who fall to the bottom lose confidence and suffer from a sense of inferiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hierarchical system of teaching, which is designed to lead those at the top to higher positions, naturally creates a tendency for those at the top to look down on those at the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But let me remind you of something. The lower-ranked people were also talented children who were  called  prodigies  in  their  birthplace.  And  because  they  are  such  children,  they  have  little experience of being treated with contempt and are not accustomed to being looked down upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stress they are under is greater than they can imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  are  unable  to  overcome  barriers  no  matter  how  hard  they  try,  they  are  praised  as  gifted children, but they are buried in the lowest class, and they feel a sense of depression that is building up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And those who can no longer endure such a situation turn their eyes to those who are even inferior to  them.  An  outlet  for  their  accumulated  inferiority  complex.  At  the  bottom  of  the  pile  was Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-16"></a>"I wish he would just give up on the futility of it all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's putting us on the same level as him, and it's a real nuisance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conversation was full of malice and contempt, whispered in a whisper, but at a volume that Nozomu could surely hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu covers his ears to hear the venom seeping into them, but his heart is aching with a dull ache. He bites his back teeth and endures the dull pain, a blank expression plastered on his face as he looks down at his battered desk. It is an act of simply enduring the storm as it passes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even if Nozomu himself tries to ignore it, the malice is coming from the other side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yo, useless trash, you come to class again for no reason?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A low, mocking tone of voice is directed at Nozomu. He looks up to see three boys standing in front of his desk, looking down at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who spoke to him was a particularly large male student standing in the middle of the three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a young man with a worn-out uniform and short blond hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars Dickens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is a student who is considered one of the most problematic students not only in this tenth grade, but also in the second grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars is a student who should be in a higher class, but because of his belligerent personality and bad behavior, he is stuck in the tenth grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite Mars' provocative words and gaze, Nozomu remained face down and his expression did not  move  a  muscle.  Mars  distorted  his  expression  and  revealed  his  displeasure  at  the  sight  of Nozomu, who did not respond at all and proceeded to prepare for class in a nonchalant manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look," he said. "He can't even talk back. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I agree. Well, even your childhood friend, Red Hair Princess, abandoned you. Maybe it's time for you to stop dreaming. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars looks down at him and Nozomu is silent. Seeing the two, the cronies on either side of Mars raise their voices. As if in sync with their voices, the students around them begin to laugh as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abandoned. At these words, Nozomu bit his back teeth with a grit ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, what the hell are you ignoring!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu's consciousness sank past, one of his cronies, mistakenly believing that he was being ignored, kicked Nozomu's desk, raising his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  body  was  thrown  to  the  wooden  floor  along  with  his  tattered  desk,  and  his  fallen textbook made a rustling sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-17"></a>Mars's cronies, who thought they were being ignored, raised their fists in the air as Nozomu silently began to put his desk back in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before his fist could swing down on Nozomu, the classroom door rattled open and a tall man entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh, Caskell-sensei. ....... No, no, I was just teaching this dim-witted guy a few things." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell Matthiart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  is  a  second  year,  tenth  grade  homeroom  teacher,  a  teacher  who  has  been  Nozomu  and  his classmates' tenth grade homeroom teacher since freshman year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is a male teacher in his late twenties, dressed in crisp black clothing, and has a well-groomed appearance, but he has a nervous look in his eyes, as if he looks down on others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a wrinkle on his forehead, Caskell took one look at Nozomu, who was putting back the fallen desk with Mars' cronies, and realized what had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah...... Do it after class. Don't bother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, yes. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Caskell did not question or condemn Mars' cronies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To this male teacher, Nozomu and the others were students unworthy of his teaching, like stones on the side of the road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said, "Take your seats and open your textbooks, you scrappy stones. Don't waste my time. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a heavy, menacing voice, the other students rush to their seats and unfold their textbooks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The end of the second school year is now approaching, and soon there will be final exams. If they do not  get  the required  grades  here, they  will be expelled without question. Even if they  could advance to the next grade, they would be in the lowest class again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the homeroom teacher's opinion also plays a role in the grades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But while the other students were returning to their seats, Mars was the only one who did not move from in front of Nozomu's desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars, get your ass back to your seat. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up, lowly teacher. I can hear you without your yelling. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lowly, you say. ...... You are the Student of the school, and I am the teacher of the school. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph. ....... I'm sure you can guess that just by being in charge of a scrapyard." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars snickered at Caskell's anger and returned to his seat with a glance at Nozomu, who remained prone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-18"></a>Caskelll flushed at Mars' attitude and was about to release his anger, but before he could do so, the first bell of the school day rang in the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tsk...... Mars, come to my place after school, okay! " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell seemed to have no choice but to say just that to Mars, opened his textbook, and began class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to know is that magic is a technique that uses one's own mental power to raise the magical elements in the body and manifest various phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lecture that Caskell began with was mainly magic-related. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The history and geopolitics of the countries of the continent are also taught at the academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we use large-scale magic, we often use magical elements from the outside world. This is called ceremonial magic, which originally originated from rituals to offer prayers to spirits and native deities. Ritual magic is also the source of the two deployment methods in today's magic: the chanting method and the formation method. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Caskell  has  a  bias  against  people  of  the  tenth  class,  he  is  a  teacher  at  the  Solminati Academy at a young age, and his lessons are lean and very easy to listen to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students dutifully transcribe the written notes on the blackboard. For Nozomu, in particular, the written exam is the one in which he gets the most points out of the regular exams, so he takes it very seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For one reason or another, he is hopelessly inept at practical tests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tomorrow, we will be experimenting with ritual magic and the effects of the presence or absence and  superiority  of  catalysts.  Ah  yes,  Nozomu  Bountis,  you  don't  have  to  participate.  You  are nothing if not just the best trash." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll join ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flat-tongued reply that could be either inertia or resignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Nozomu's powerless words, Caskell does not seem to be bothered by them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. Then stay at the edge. Don't get in the way." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Caskell's dismissive words, some of the class members let out a chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't make a fuss, you garbage stones. From my point of view, there is no difference between you all and him. You black mold stained nameplate bearers. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Caskell's mocking words, those who had been laughing at Nozomu were silenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Solminati Academy, the rank to which each student belongs can be easily identified at a glance by his or her nameplate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the black nameplates are only for the lowest, tenth grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-19"></a>For the students in this class, this black nameplate was an abomination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell nods as silence returns to the class and resumes his lecture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's thoughts were buried in the past as the class continued in the cold air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red Haired Princess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the nickname given to Nozomu's childhood friend and lover, Lisa, at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She showed her talent immediately after entering the school and quickly rose to the top of her class in no time at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Nozomu's grades were not so good. He was not originally a studious student, nor did he have any experience with a sword. Nor did he have the same talent as Lissa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a miracle that he was able to enter Solminati Academy, and it was no surprise that his grades were not as high as they should have been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  so,  Nozomu  did  not  give  up,  and  he  devoted  himself  to  his  classes  every  day,  and  Lisa supported him earnestly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had friends who helped him, and Nozomu struggled to live up to her supportive expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if he couldn't make it now, he would grow someday. With faint hopes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But those hopes were shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Due to "an incident" that happened to Nozomu, he was unable to improve his abilities any further, and in fact, he found himself in a hopeless situation where he was at an even greater disadvantage than before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His lowly performance dropped dramatically, and he literally fell to the bottom of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally,  the  wind  around  him  grew  stronger  by  the  day,  and  with  it,  some  people  started  to directly bully him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his girlfriend, Lisa, would not leave him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They spent more time together and worked out together to reduce any ill will directed at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were not always together because the dormitory was divided by gender, but she always took Nozomu's side, and he was even more inspired by her feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, their relationship came to an abrupt end one day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good-bye." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the summer of the first school  year, Nozomu was abruptly told by Lisa that she was leaving him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-20"></a>Although  she  always  supported  Nozomu,  whose  grades  had  not  been  good,  without  showing  a single disgusted expression on her face, she was not happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't understand. His mind is spinning, and everything is as vague and unreal as a hallucination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned her icy gaze away from Nozomu and walked away without looking back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From then on, she would look at Nozomu as if she were looking at a piece of filth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was stunned by the abrupt parting. Without his realizing it, word of their separation spread throughout the school, and he was blamed for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa dumped Nozomu because he had betrayed her and was looking for another woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself had no recollection of this and immediately denied the rumor, but those around him refused to believe it at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa  is  an  honor  student  who  is  called  the  Red-haired  Princess  because  of  her  appearance  and ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  who  had  been  dating  Lisa,  was  originally  the  object  of  jealousy  because  of  her  poor grades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every single one of Nozomu's friends left, and some of them joined those who had been taunting him for some time and began cursing him in even worse terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  went  to  talk  to  Lisa,  but  she  merely  returned  a  curt  stare  and  would  not  answer  Nozomu's desperate questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was completely rejected by Lisa. Still, he continued his desperate efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  took  his  classes  seriously  at  the  academy,  and  he  subjected  himself  to  even  more  rigorous training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew that if he continued to keep his vow, she would one day be able to ............. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that thought, too, was shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that you can't just take a chance on a new person and expect them to be happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was smiling next to a man with light-pigmented blond hair, whom Nozomu knew very well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken Nortice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is one of Nozomu's childhood friends and confidants from the same hometown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Nozomu, who did not get good grades, he was one of the top students in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was personable and gentle in temperament, and like Lisa, he was someone who joined her and helped Nozomu with his training. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-21"></a>From what I have heard, Ken, another childhood friend, comforted the heartbroken Lisa and they began dating just after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, Nozomu could not believe it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  seeing  the  two  of  them  smiling  next  to  their  best  friend,  and  working  together  so  well  in practice that they outshone the other pair, Nozomu was forced to understand that he no longer had a place next to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">- </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the classroom lecture, the next class was practical training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  grounds  of  this  solminati  academy  are  vast,  and  in  one  of  the  multiple  training  grounds, practical training for the tenth grade was being conducted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The content of the training is anti-personnel training. In the training hall where the class was being held, each student was wielding his or her own weapon while facing a wooden scarecrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, the students are paired up for a mock battle. We will decide the pairings. You can use qijutsu and magic as you wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both qi-jutsu and magic are techniques that exist in this world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu is the general term for techniques that use life energy called qi. Magic is also a generic term for techniques that use mental energy called mana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  are secret  techniques that have been handed  down in  various forms, including  rituals  and folklore, throughout the continent of Ark Mill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Arcazam, these techniques have been discovered, accumulated, compiled, and systematized, and are now being passed on to students in the form of education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the words of their supervisor, Caskell, the students of the second year tenth class confirmed their opponents for the mock battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, the pairs were chosen, and the opponent Nozomu’s chosen....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pairing was decided one by one, and Nozomu's opponent. "Hey there, useless trash. sorry to hear that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Mars, who had been involved before the earlier classroom lecture. He was wearing simple leather and metal armor over his school uniform and gauntlets that covered his upper arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The student uniforms of Solminati Academy are originally designed to be sturdy for combat, but some students, like Mars, wear armor on top of them to protect themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pulls out the large sword on his back with his right hand, and as if to show off his strength, he flashes it with a "Boom! " He swung it loudly. The wind pressure generated shook Nozomu's hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars is a rough man, but his fighting ability is quite impressive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-22"></a>Nozomu exhaled heavily and drew the mock sword at his waist as if he was ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His weapon is called a katana, a sword unique to the island nation on the Far East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a curved sword, which is specialized for cutting and thrusting, is said to easily cut through even steel when used by a swordmaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, because of the high level of skill required to handle it and the rarity of the sword itself, it is not widely used on the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  for  Nozomu,  who  for  some  reason  has  difficulty  relying  on  physical  strength,  ki,  or magic, it is the most suitable weapon, and the only one with which he might be able to find a way to make use of in a fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's get on with it, it's a waste of time dealing with the useless bottom. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thick sword of the sword which is thicker than Nozomu's sword, though made of wood, still showers those who face it with a considerable sense of intimidation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, then, begin. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a nonchalant signal from Caskell, the mock battle begins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, with his great sword at the ready, stepped toward Nozomu at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With spirit, Mars swings down his great sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to parry the large swinging attack with his sword, but the moment the two swords collide, he is stopped by a powerful force that presses down on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gugu...... this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stepped on both feet and swept Mars' slash to the side, slamming the great sword that had caught him to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was, he stepped forward, sliding the mock sword into the fleshy sword that dropped to the ground, and attempted to cleave Mars' torso. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Too late!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mars was faster than Nozomu could strike the  sword, and with one hand off the hilt of his great sword, he repelled Nozomu's slash with his gauntlet. Mars took another step forward and struck Nozomu in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly lowered his head to avoid the oncoming fist strike, but Mars did not care that he had lost his fist and forcefully drew his great sword with his remaining one hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-23"></a>Because of the close distance between them, the great sword did not carry enough momentum, but Mars forced Nozomu away with his own monstrous strength. The two sides opened up the gap between them and partitioned off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Zei ei ei!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great swords and mock swords crossed each other countless times with a high-pitched sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars tries to smash them down with his great spacing and arm strength, and Nozomu tries to slip into the distance where his sword can reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while, the attack and defense unfolded using only swordsmanship and physical prowess, but then the two sides opened the gap again as they were both bounced away by the reaped great sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Enough, let's me crush you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Mars  muttered  a  few  words,  a  shimmering  chi  flame  rose  from  his  body,  and  the  sense  of intimidation that emanated from him swelled up at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is  a technique originated in the eastern part of the continent, in which a person's life force is raised and various phenomena are manifested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, with the Qi-inflammation rising, stepped toward Nozomu at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His speed was incomparable to anything he had ever done before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  benefit  of  physical  reinforcement  by  Qi-jutsu.  Mars  caught  Nozomu  in  his  sword  range  at once and swung his great sword at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also quickly used Qi-jutsu and jumped to the side to avoid Mars' great sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword swung down with a roar, rolling up the ground and scattering earth and sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, did i just miss it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars was not happy that he could not decide with a single blow, he said venomously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars pulled out his great sword, which had dug into the ground, and slashed at Nozomu again as it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, facing Mars, also exerted all his chi and intercepted him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used his Qi-jutsu to strengthen his body to deal with the large sword that was roaring at him from above, below, left, and right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mars' Qi-jutsu body reinforcement was far more effective than Nozomu's. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-24"></a>Every time Mars' great sword struck, Gong! Gun! The impact was so strong that it resonated to the core of the body, and Nozomu's body was swept from side to side, dizzying him and driving him backward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, Nozomu gritted his teeth and managed to bite back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He manages to regain his balance with his enhanced physical strength, and just before it becomes impossible, he manages to hold on and continues to pass on the impact, daring to step backwards with his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Enough of this! " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because his opponent, whom he thought he could crush immediately, resisted more than he expected, Mars' frustration grew, and he became more energetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' slashes accelerated, and a storm of intense sword fights with increased momentum struck Nozomu.  Then,  with  a  snarl,  Mars'  cleaving  blow  was  followed  by  a  whammy!  The  body  of Nozomu was sent flying backward with a loud "bang" sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gap between Nozomu and Mars was further widened by the Qi-jutsu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who boasts of his originally blessed physique and quantity of energy, is now the only one who is able to use Qi-jutsu. On the other hand, Nozomu was inferior to Mars in terms of strength, and the effect of the physical reinforcement he was able to exert was not as good as that of the qi he was consuming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, Nozomu swung his mock sword in an attempt to bite back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried to read Mars's sword line, which was becoming monotonous due to his frustration, and to somehow pass the impact by aligning his mock sword with the cutting line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a resistance worthy of being called a mantis' axe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he could only manage to handle it, and there was no room for Nozomu to counterattack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if he could not fight back, he knew exactly what would come next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, the limit came. Unable to handle Mars' hard blow, his stance collapsed, and without time to regain his collapsed position, a returning sword struck Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fuck you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly placed his own mock sword between Mars' great sword and his own body, but was unable to stop his opponent's enhanced slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BAKIN!  With  a  "Slash"  sound,  the  mock  sword  is  shattered,  and  Mars'  great  sword  catches Nozomu's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's body was blown wide open and slammed against the wall of the training hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact on his chest choked him, and his vision faded to black in his agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-25"></a>"Damn you, you maggot. You're wasting your time for resisting me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu lost consciousness as he heard Mars' words as if he was going to spit them out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">- </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pitch-black vision and the consciousness drifting vaguely in the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What wake me up was an intense pain, as if countless needles were pricking me from the inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ow! It hurts, It hurts …." </p>
<p class="calibre1">His whole body shakes involuntarily, and he shrinks back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he sat up, Nozomu finally realized where he was. He was in the school infirmary, on a bed for the sick. On a small table beside the bed were Nozomu's jacket, neatly folded, and his sword, his weapon of choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, did you wake up?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if prompted by a cool voice, Nozomu shook his head and saw a woman in white sitting on a chair in front of the office desk in the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A young woman with long, narrow framed glasses. She has a quill pen in her hand, and an ink bottle and a sheet of paper on her desk hand, as if she was writing something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her name is Norn Alteina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is the school's infirmary doctor, and the word "intelligent and beautiful" fits her perfectly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Nozomu had been brought to this infirmary after passing out in a mock battle class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You was brought to the infirmary after passing out in the simulation class. Are you feeling pain anywhere else?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I have a little back and chest pain, and I'm a little lightheaded, but other than that, not much else." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  understand.  I  have  already  put  medicine  on  your  back  and  chest,  but  if  you  feel  discomfort anywhere else, or if the pain persists, you can always come to me. It would be even worse if you just put up with it and it gets worse. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  has  been  a  regular  customer  of  the  infirmary  since  he  was  originally  a  student  with  a constant stream of fresh injuries. Naturally, he also knows Norn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you for taking care of me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't worry about it. It is my duty to treat students' injuries and illnesses. However, your attitude has not changed. You could be a little more open-minded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a smile on his sharp good looks, Norn put his hand on Nozomu's shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was not the slightest hint of disdain for the inferior Nozomu in that smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>Unlike Caskell, Norn was one of the few people who treated Nozomu, the lowest student in the second grade, with no disrespect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, that ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Norn, who has a more open attitude, Nozomu's gaze drifts in the air, as if he is lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn smiled at Nozomu, who was clearly not relaxed. It is usual for this student to display such an attitude of detachment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, loud footsteps came slamming from outside the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Norn~~, how is Nozomu-kun ～～～～" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a pause, someone opens the door of the infirmary vigorously and enters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a female teacher in her early twenties with long brown hair in gentle waves, soft eyes, and neat appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brown-haired beauty looked around the infirmary to check on Nozomu, who was on the bed, and ran up to him with a smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  smiled  and  ran  over  to  him.  "This  is  a  school.  Even  if  you're  talking  to  me,  you  must  use honorific titles when you call me. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehhhh, there's no one here, it's fine. ～～～～" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hora~hora </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn, pointing at Nozomu, rebukes the beautiful woman for calling him by his name as soon as he enters, but the important thing is that she does not seem to mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri Var. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is a teacher working at Solminati Academy and currently assists each class teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri Var is a popular teacher among her students because of her beautiful face, but the main reason for her popularity is her personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she was inexperienced as a teacher, she was a kind woman who never lost her sincere attitude toward her students, even those in the lowest 10th class, not dismissing them as useless like Caskell did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri was still young and her job was to assist the class teacher, but despite her gentle tone, her straightforward behavior earned her a great deal of trust from the students, regardless of rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I were to mention her shortcomings, I would say that she has a tendency to use language that seems to have a few screws missing from her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the fact that she was chosen as a teacher at this school when she was only in her 20s was proof that her abilities were not based on her loose language and behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-27"></a>I'm really embarrassed by Anri's attitude," she said. Well, it's always been that way. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn puts his hand on his forehead as if complaining of a headache and lets out a sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri and Norn. They are both from this Solminati Academy and have been best friends since their school days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They hit it off when they first entered the school and have been friends ever since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had also heard about them. And he envied them for having such a relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friendship and love. The two of them had a different form, but their solid bond was too dazzling for Nozomu, who had fallen into loneliness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, are you okay~? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes, I'm fine now. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Anri looks into Nozomu's face with concern, Nozomu stifles the emotion that almost wells up in his chest and averts his gaze to cover it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's view was filled with Anri's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sweet scent of her eyes, which reminded him of a mature woman's fruit, made his heart skip a beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman's eyes are moist with the sweet scent of an adult woman's fruit, and Nosom's heart leaps. "Please move a little away from me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, but~~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu involuntarily backed off on the bed, but Anri, who is merely concerned about Nozomu's injuries, closed the distance without hesitation, zui, zui. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to move away from the approaching Anri by moving to the edge of the bed. He was suddenly approached by a beautiful woman, but the awkwardness caused by the petty jealousy he had just harbored was making him sit up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Norn sighs heavily again at the sight of his best friend approaching a student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah ....... Norn, he'll be fine. He had some bruising on his chest and back, and a mild concussion, but the pain will subside soon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also nodded in affirmation of Norn's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really~?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ho, it's true. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his narrowed eyes, there was a will to see through Nozomu's condition and an equal amount of concern for his well-being. Anri looked at Nozomu for a while, but finally, perhaps believing his best friend's diagnosis, he quickly moved away from Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>She said, "I was ...... worried. I'm worried about you, Nozomu-kun, because if something were to happen to you, I'd be in trouble. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's all right, Anri. He won't done on this much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, God, Norn is cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm telling you this because I know he's in good hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu is a regular in the infirmary, Norn is well aware of his condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He simply stated that there was no problem, but the important thing was that Anri didn't like Norn's tone and puffed up his cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the bell rang to announce the end of the school day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it after school already? ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu peeked out the window of the infirmary, he saw that the students who had finished their day's classes were heading home one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, he had been sleeping in the infirmary for quite some time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gets off the bed, puts on his jacket, and puts his own gains back on his waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Norn-sensei and Anri-sensei, for all your help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd like to check, Nozomu-kun, are you still go to the Spasim Forest?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ye, yeah. In case......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's words brought a difficult look to Anri's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Spasim  Forest  is  a  deep  forest  that  surrounds  Arcazam,  the  city  that  houses  the  Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  wide  variety  of  plants  and  animals  grow  in  this  forest,  and  there  are  students  and  ordinary citizens who earn their living by hunting and gathering in the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the reason for the establishment of the Solminati Academy, it is also a useful forest for gaining experience in actual combat against demonic beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, while rich forests are a blessing to the people, they are also home to powerful demonic beasts, and many people die or go missing every year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu,  you have been in  this  town for almost two  years now, so  you  know that the Spasim forest is very dangerous in some places. Especially deep in the forest, there are many monsters and beasts that even experienced adventurers and knights are afraid of. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Yes, I know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why - I think you should form a party. I understand that it's difficult for Nozomu to party with other students, but ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-29"></a>"I'm sorry, Anri-Sensei," she said. I'm fine for now, and I'm in a hurry, so see you later......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without hearing Anri's last words, Nozomu left the infirmary as if to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri's hand was extended to Nozomu, and his hand was swinging in the air as if he had no where to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's gone, isn't he? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh my God~, please hear me out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn smiles wryly at Anri, who is preening and indignant and his shoulders are angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But neither Anri nor Nozomu-kun have changed. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even Norn is selfish ...... mo." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't blame you. Do you know how many times this exchange has been repeated since Anri met him? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn and Nozomu met when he was in his second grade, but Anri met Nozomu about six months ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It all started when Anri came to visit Nozomu, who was covered in bandages in the infirmary after being injured in a mock battle, during a break, and was worried about him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the beginning, Nozomu didn't listen to Anri at all. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He still doesn't listen to me! I'm worried about him and I'm telling him to make party with me~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the beginning, Nozomu only responded to Anri's call for concern with curt replies such as, "I'm fine," "I'm used to it," and so on. This has not changed much to this day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However,  I understand  Anri's  concern for  Nozomu-kun, but  isn't  it difficult for him to  form  a party because of his characteristics?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn's tone of voice, on the other hand, was somewhat resigned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is completely isolated from the rest of the world due to rumors circulating in the past and his performance at the bottom of his class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this meritocratic school, no one would be crazy enough to party with such a student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aside from the conflict with his girlfriend, there was another reason why Nozomu had fallen to the bottom of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was due to "abilities" that he developed in the first grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abilities are a general term for abilities that can be expressed regardless of race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fundamental cause of why they are manifested regardless of race is not known, but it is said that when they are manifested, the person can receive various benefits depending on the ability, and there are countless types of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-30"></a>And Nozomu's ability is called "ability suppression". </p>
<p class="calibre1">When expressed, it suppresses the person's abilities and prevents  them from  growing beyond a certain level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the effects of items, magic, and Qi-jutsu on suppressed abilities are clearly inferior to those brought to ordinary people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is an extremely rare ability, it does not benefit the individual at all, but rather drags him or her down. In the case of Nozomu, three abilities (physical, magical, and qi) are suppressed, which is a great disadvantage in practical skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This "ability suppression" further weakened Nozomu's already poor performance, and in practical skills he ranked last among his peers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was only able to advance to the second grade because of the results of the written exam, but even so, he had to take two supplementary examinations during the exam for advancement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No student would party with such a slow and unpromising person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, but~~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri, on the other hand, looks like he is not ready to give up and is anxiously shaking his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a kind-hearted girl, she probably wants Nozomu to join her party at any cost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Besides, he still avoids strangers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Norn's point, Anri also falls silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was about a year ago that she was assigned as a health doctor, but since that time, Nozomu's condition had been terrible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The physical injuries were often terrible, but more than that, his mind was dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He would answer accurately about his injuries and pain, but he would not answer any questions about his mind, such as the problems he was having. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even when I made simple small talk with him, I would only get a mute response. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once  the  treatment  was  over,  he  would  return  to  training  unobtrusively,  and  then  visit  the infirmary again with his injuries. Sometimes he would visit the infirmary early in the morning, so when I asked him what he had done, he said he had gone into the spasim forest alone. Moreover, when I asked him how long he had been doing this, he replied that he had been doing it almost every day since the first grade. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This behavior was indeed a crisis, and Norn interviewed him several times to warn him, but the results were not good. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-31"></a>"Anri has been somewhat more forthcoming with him," Norn said. "But it's not enough, and most importantly, his behavior hasn't changed at all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was largely due to Anri's efforts that Nozomu began to talk normally, if only a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn's best friend, who does not care about personal space, has been able to shorten the distance between  him  and  Nozomu,  who  had  been  rejecting  others,  with  his  natural  cheerfulness  and kindness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to this, they are now able to make small talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there has been no progress beyond that. He refuses to talk about any of his worries or anxieties, and he won't stop going into the forest by himself. Silence passes between Norn and Anri. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But if i try, I'm sure he'll be able to do it~. Nozomu-kun, he certainly have a lot of bad things to say about, but if everyone get to know about him, they'll see that he’s not the boy that the rumor say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn nodded in agreement with these words of Anri. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  has  been called a lot of derogatory names,  but  if  you  get  to  know him,  you will soon realize that he is not a cruel person as rumors say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And not only the students, but also the teachers say that Nozomu doesn't have any buds, but I don't think that's true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you have any evidence?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can't do anything about his original qi or magic power, but I can hone his skills~~. I don't think his skill with a sword is something to be discarded. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Certainly,  I  think  we  can  hone  techniques  that  don't  rely  on  simple  qi  or  magic,  such  as swordsmanship and spearmanship. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teachers are indifferent to Nozomu because of the "ability suppression". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teachers at  this  school  do not  have enough time to  continue teaching  students  who are not expected to grow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you can't, just quit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the stance of most teachers at this school, and teachers like Anri are rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, when asked if there is no room for growth at all, Anri says that this is by no means the case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He can learn techniques such as swordsmanship and spearmanship, and even if his total amount of qi and magic power does not increase, his skill in handling it does not matter. It is the 'upper limit' of his abilities that is being suppressed, not his skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, how is Nozomu-kun skill in swordsmanship? " </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-32"></a>"I've seen it before during Caskell's classes - I'm not an expert in swordsmanship, so I don't know much about some of it either. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been a little afraid of it," she said. " Because he who has a hopeless ability gap in qi-jutsu and magic' was not even close enough to bite the opponent ~?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even at the tenth grade, the students of this school are more highly trained than the regular soldiers of any other country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the third  grade, most  of the students  are ranked C, and some students  of the fifth  grade and above have reached B rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rank C is equivalent to a skilled soldier. Even among adventurers, this is the rank of those who are reasonably skilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the physical abilities of such people, enhanced by qijutsu and magic, are unmatched by ordinary people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was surprising to Norn that he was able to bite such an existence almost in the flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought his body was well-trained, but not that well. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, it made sense. Norn is not an expert in martial arts or swordsmanship, but as a physician, she has examined the bodies of such warriors many times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  impression  of  Nozomu's  body  was  that  of  a  "masterful  sword  that  forged  by  a  skilled blacksmith who works tirelessly and without sleep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A well-proportioned body with no unnecessary flab or fat. A body that, despite the heavy fetters of suppressed abilities, has overcome pain over and over again in an effort to break those fetters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body was not the result of natural talent, but just like the sword used by Nozomu, his body had been trained to the utmost, without waste, through training that was so severe that it was almost mind-boggling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, it was the countless scars on his body that caught her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only lacerations and bruises, but even brand new stitches that Norn could not remember, were numerous on Nozomu's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So I say to him, i think you should consider quitting" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Norns say things like that too ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm just saying, as an opinion. As a doctor, I just don't want to see more needless live wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know what I mean? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, silence passes between the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn  and  Anri  looked  at  each  other  for  a  while,  but  then,  suddenly,  Anri's  gaze  turned  to  the window of the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn and  Anri  looked at each other for a moment,  but  then Anri's  gaze suddenly turned to  the window of the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, I think so too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lured by Anri's gaze, Norn also looked out the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There, he saw Nozomu running out of the school building at a run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But is it possible to acquire that much physical strength and swordsmanship on one's own? ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Norn watched Nozomu run out the other side of the main gate, a question suddenly popped into his mind. </p>
