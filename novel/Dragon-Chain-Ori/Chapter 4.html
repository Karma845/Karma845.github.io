<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Awareness of Running Away, and The First Step</h3>

<p class="calibre1">After  afternoon  classes  and  a  workout  at  the  Shino  hut,  Nozomu  was  running  through  the Spasim Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While run throught along the roadless road, Nozomu's mind was still occupied with the events of the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, he was unable to concentrate during training and received countless slur from Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as he moves his body in this way, Nozomu's mind is rattled with a sense of agitation and fear, as if he is being chased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, in order to forget the pain in his heart, he just keep running in the dark, even now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though it was his own wish, the days of being constantly drilled in one swordsmanship technique  and  fighting  style  after  another,  Nozomu's  life  was  filled  with  training  and swordsmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, Nozomu himself could no longer stand the days of constant denial of his innocence, no matter how much he appealed for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This leads to an escape that he himself unconsciously turns away from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Nozomu has lost sight of his goal of supporting the dream of his childhood familiarity, and  is  in  a  state  of  running  away  from  a  reality  he  does  not  want  to  see  by  repeating  life-destroying workouts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the desire to commit suicide due to desperation has disappeared, the fact that he is escaping remains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words in the central park and his encounter with Lisa were a relentless confrontation with a fact that he had turned his back on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, ha, ha. .......Here's ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, Nozomu kept running to shake off the past, but before he knew it, he was deep in the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even more inconveniently, fog had also begun to appear, gradually increasing its density. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is quite dangerous to encounter dense fog in the forest. The possibility of losing one's sense of direction and location increases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu decided to return to Shino's hut immediately, but the fog quickly became so bad that he could not see more than a few meters ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not good. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu mumbles to himself and takes out his compass, which he always has with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-106"></a>He always carries a compass when entering the forest so that he does not lose his bearings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the needle, which would normally point north in the forest with no problem, spins around and does not point in a certain direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What happen, this is ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are indeed many demonic beasts in this forest, but there has never been anything that could make a compass go haywire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu takes a few deep breaths to calm his impatience with the unforeseen situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Checking  the  surroundings  again,  he  sharpen  his  senses  for  any  sign  or  trace  of  a  demonic beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many demonic beasts search for prey using their sense of smell and hearing other than sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place where he is now is overgrown with trees, and although he can hide himself for the time being, it is hardly a safe zone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For now, I guess i'll just have to build a shelter or climb a tree to see which direction i'm going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">...... hmm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was wondering whether to wait for the fog to clear or to continue on,  checking his direction, when he noticed a bright light leaking through a gap in the trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What on earth is in there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  pondering  for  a  while,  Nozomu  decided  to  check  the  source  of  the  light  and  slowly weaved his way through the trees toward the light leaking out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, however, the light that had been shining like sunlight through the trees burst into large flashes, and Nozomu's field of vision was filled with a flash of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huahh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intense light made Nozomu involuntarily hold out his hand and squint his eyes. When the flash of light subsided and his vision, which had been painted white, returned, he saw a scene he had not expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell is this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What leapt into his view was barren land as far as the eye could see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounded by desolate rocky mountains, there was no sign of any living creature, unlike the forest he must have been in earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world ....... This isn't the Arcazam neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination i know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, a huge shadow covered him as he was confused by the incomprehensible event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looks up to see what it is and exclaims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge black creature was glaring at Nozomu from the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-107"></a>A huge body covered in jet-black scales. Each scale is as large and thick as a tower shield, and its massiveness seems to symbolize the seemingly endless years it has lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From its back, a pair of red-scarlet, azure sky, green, and ochre-colored wings, and a pair of jet-black wings identical to those on its body, spread out and flap powerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The darkness hidden in it eyes is intimidating to all who see them, and it evoke an instinctive fear from deep within the soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dragon ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A manifestation of absolute power that spreads an overwhelming presure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of an existence beyond his imagination, Nozomu's mouth spontaneously murmured its name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dragon is a spirit species, supposed to have already disappeared into history and legend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  standing  there  with  a  stunned  look  on  his  face.  He  could  not  understand  his situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you think about it normally, it is impossible to encounter a legendary dragon right under your nose in the town where you live, no matter how much it was in a forest where demonic beasts appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  while  Nozomu  was  in  a  doumb  state,  the  eyes  of  the  giant  dragon  had  caught  him completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon's eyes, looking down at Nozomu, are filled with pure joy and amusement at having found it first catch in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, the jet-black dragon folded its wings and descended in a straight line toward Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly put his whole body on alert and kicked the ground to get away from the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, a giant dragon descended with a roaring sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon's own weight and the impact of its descent cause the ground to flip up and scatter it around like a bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  caught  in  the  shockwave  and  was  blown  away  and  knocked  to  the  ground, squirming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuahh ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reflexively, he rounded his body and took a passive stance to escape the impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, he did not suffer any serious injuries that would impede his movement, but flying stones and rock fragments cut him here and there on his uniform, and blood began to ooze from the ripped cuts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-108"></a>Nozomu immediately decided to withdraw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaching into a pouch at his waist, he pulled out several gray spherical blobs, each large enough to fit in the palm of his hand, and slammed them all to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, "Pang!" A great deal of smoke is scattered around the area with a bursting sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This gray mass, called a smokescreen ball, was, as you can see, a tool for blinding opponents by generating a smoke screen, a tool that he kept with him at all times, as he often had to flee from demonic beasts in the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu ran on and on, blending in with the smokescreen that had been created. His goal is the light that he saw when he wandered into this place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you look  closely,  you  can see the white light  you saw in  the fog spilling out  through the smoke screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he can get there, he may be able to return to the spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he wasn't thinking straight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"GUUUUUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu ran behind the smoke screen, a powerful shock wave hit him from behind with a deafening roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  roar,  which  seemed  to  echo  to  the  heavens,  blew  away  not  only  the  smoke  screen  that Nozomu had lit, but also his body like a leaf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huaaahhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was astonished at the dragon's power to blow people away with a simple roar, the giant dragon opened its mouth wide and began to focus a giant flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its flame is a mixture of various colors, a mixtures of black an others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu obeys the greatest alarm his instincts sound, and as soon as he lands on the ground, he leaves the scene with a blink of his legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  after  Nozomu  activates  his  flash  step,  a  giant  flame  is  ejected  from  the  Giant Dragon's mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant flame passed by him and landed on a hill far away. The next moment, sound vanished from the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu found himself flying in the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt as if his situation was someone else's, but a few seconds later, he hit the ground, forcing his consciousness back to reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-109"></a>Whipping his body, which aches from the impact of the fall, he pulls a potion from his pouch and drinks it down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  immensely  excited  to  see  the  direction  where  the  forest  had  been  as  He  felt  the restorative healing his body rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bullshit, you're kidding, right? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hill  where the giant dragon's  breath  landed disappeared, leaving a crater so  deep that it could have contained the Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The inside of the crater was stained red with molten rock at extremely high temperatures, and a thick cloud of black smoke was billowing out of the crater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The edges of the huge hole emitting black smoke are covered with molten rock, some of which is vitrified, giving it the appearance of a sword mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Nozomu  turned  around  with  a  stunned  expression,  the  jet-black  dragon  spread  its  five-colored six-wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There, countless light balls in five colors appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Spirit Magic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic used by the spirit species known as the world's genus itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike other magic used by non-spirit species, magic that does not require chanting or other processes that interfere with the outside world is activated the moment the spirit decides to use it, enabling an overwhelmingly fast attack compared to other magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu once again follows the alarm bells sounded by his instincts and applies the physical reinforcement of his qi with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless  light  balls  attacked,  followed  by  tails  of  light.  The  amount  of  light  was  so extraordinary that it filled most of his field of vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, while evacuating as fast as he could, used his sword to slash away the light balls and resisted with all his might to avoid a fatal wound, but he was unable to handle the sheer number of them and was quickly swallowed by the swarm of light balls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when the rain  of light  stopped,  Nozomu,  who had been pierced  all  over his  body, was lying there like a ragged piece of cloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu frantically moves one slightly moving arm to retrieve the potion from the pouch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  all  the  bottles  containing  the  potions  were  broken,  and  only  the  gushy,  wet,  wet feeling returned to his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having no choice, he removes the pouch, squeezes out with one hand the chemical solution that has soaked into the fabric, and swallows it down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-110"></a>As he groaned and groaned at the sensation of his body being forcibly healed, he looked up to see the giant dragon approaching at a leisurely pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, hah, hah. ............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With trembling hands, Nozomu raised himself up and limped away from the giant dragon, but there was no way he could escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrl......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaahh......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant dragon, perhaps amused by the sight of Nozomu scrambling on his feet, slows down and chases after him with a guttural sound in his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes, just for fun, the dragon would lightly poke Nozomu's body with it paw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a light poke from the giant dragon's paw, Nozomu's body bounces and rolls like a ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it watched, the giant dragon's throaty voice growled with even more enjoyment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon continues to play with the little creature in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a child playfully picking at an ant's leg, or a cat playing with a mouse it has killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only despair for Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is nothing in the techniques and tools at hand that can compete with a giant dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was running out of energy, and his body was already falling apart inside and out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the limit comes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact of being blown up and slammed to the ground hit his head, and his consciousness became clouded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing death from which there is no escape, Nozomu's hazy vision recalls everything that has happened up to this point as if it were a running light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scenery of his hometown where he was born and the smiling faces of his parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He met Lisa in a peaceful village and fell in love with her, attracted to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  want  to  support  Lisa's  dream.  With  that  vow  in  his  mind,  He  knocked  on  the  door  of Solminati Academy with only his thoughts and feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's parents were against him going to Arcazam, and they ended up fighting or splitting up, but they still did not regret it at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was anxious about going to an unfamiliar place, but this was outweighed by his desire to support Lisa's dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But reality was ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ability and grades are not growing as he expected. The people he love and his best friends are moving on without him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-111"></a>He grew impatient and struggled to get his footing, but the onset of ability suppression blocked his path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, out of the blue, Lisa broke up with him, and without knowing why, his love affair fell apart. He was completely isolated from the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I want to support Lisa's dream. I wished I did, but ...... I still. ............) What went wrong and why did it happen? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just thinking about it causes pain in Nozomu's chest and his heart to squeal with a creak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is as if the rings of a rusty chain are rubbing against each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of such despair, he met Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their meeting was not a good one, with both starting with ignorance and dislike, but as a result, Nozomu was able to gain a mentor in the midst of his isolation at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'm glad I met shisho. She's a stubborn, but definitely a good person.) Although he was pushed around a lot and had to go through hellish training days, she definitely took care of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first she was going to ignore him, but then she complained and helped him when he was attacked by a wild dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking back, Nozomu was back to his old self in front of Shino. He was himself when he was honestly laughing and honestly angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And recently, someone has been talking to him a lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henri Var and Norn Alteina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those teachers were the first to care about him, as he was treated as a complete non-entity at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They talked to him, paying no attention to the rumors about Nozomu that everyone in the school should have known about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite being the daughters of a great aristocrat, they are unusual sisters, who are not afraid to talk about dogs and cats without being seen by others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  Nozomu,  who  had  been  left  behind  in  heated  discussions  with  those  sisters  but  he  was neither completely ignored or scorned, it was the first normal time she had spent with people her own age in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu turned his back on her when she tried to tell him that she doesn't judge people based on rumors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a regret that weighs on his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, for the first time in almost a year, he talked to Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-112"></a>He tried again to clear up the misunderstanding, but in front of her, he couldn't put any of the important things into words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It's always the same. I can't do anything when it matters. ......) Words of self-denial. The chains  that bounding  Nozomu's heart have always kept  him from looking ahead and prevented him from taking a step forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant dragon raises its huge, tower-like paws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment that leg swung down, Nozomu would be crushed to death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu closes his eyes, unaware that he is trapped in a sense of resignation in the face of his own death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the giant dragon's paw swung down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the giant dragon's paws closed in on Nozomu, a shadow suddenly leaped out from the side of his body, grabbed him by the scruff, and instantly broke away from the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  after,  the  giant  dragon's  paw  slams  into  the  ground,  creating  a  roar  and  a shockwave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell are you doing, you stupid disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh, Shisho......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What caught Nozomu's eye amidst the cloud of dirt and smoke scattered by the shockwave was his master, who was supposed to be waiting for him in the hut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino always watches him from a distance while Nozomu is running around, but when Nozomu suddenly disappeared shortly after the fog, she was in a hurry to find him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she jumped into the strange light, which was not possible in the fog, and saw the sight of his disciple being toyed with by the monster in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Suddenly, I lost you in the fog, and when I looked for you, I saw that you were in a terrible mess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With wrinkles etched on her forehead, Shino looks up at the giant dragon in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Five-colored, six-wings, and jet-black body. The legendary Dragon King of Destruction, no doubt. Good grief, I never thought that at my age I would have to deal with such a mythical monster. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Dragon King of Destruction ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, the name is Tiamat, a abominable black dragon who devoured it own race 5,000 years ago and was supposed to be sealed away by it own race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat, the Dragon King </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-113"></a>The most heretic among the heretics, it devoured even it own race and was feared by all living beings.  Tiamat  is  a  legendary  dragon  that  was  sealed  more  than  5,000  years  ago  and  was supposed to have disappeared from the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's really bad luck for me to come face to face with such a monster after my disciples have gone into hiding. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho ...... Goho Goho!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu sobbed, red blood danced in his cough and cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a high possibility that the internal organs are damaged. The condition of the disciple is worse than expected, and Shino grits his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, listen to me. I will distract that monster, and you must escape." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That, but Shisho is ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In any case, if we stay stuck together, you won't be able to get away with ......ck!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring the questioning master and disciple, Tiamat's paw slams into the ground right next to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino leaps as quickly as she can, pulling Nozomu's body with her. At the same time, she pulls out the sword and sheath from her waist and with a flash of her sword, cuts away the incoming shockwave and debris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, go! Run for your lives and don't look back!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho, agggh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing Nozomu far away as soon as she landed, Sino stepped directly toward Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blink of an eye, triggered without a beat, Shino's accelerates her body at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, who had closed the distance in a moment, put all his strength into the sword and pulled it  out  without  hesitation,  but  the  released  Phantom  was  blocked  by  the  massive  scales,  and poof! The explosion was accompanied by a "fizzle" sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew it, but not even a scratch!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the uninjured Tiamat, Shino unintentionally be marked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  in  the  face  of  Sino's  resistance,  Tiamat's  gaze  shifted  from  Nozomu  to  her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Tiamat was more interested in the live toy </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrl......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a gleeful guttural sound, Tiamat spreads her wings and deploys countless light bullets, firing them en masse at Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deployed light bullets move organically like a school of fish, rushing in from all directions at their prey, the shino. The number of them is more than a hundred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-114"></a>Pouring qi into the sword, Shino continues to deal with the swarms of light bullets that come at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her swordsmanship is truly worthy of being called expert, and she unleashed a barrage of blows that would have been unthinkable from an old woman's slender frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a single flash, she slashes through more than five bullets, shatters ten bullets with a burst of his qi-sword, and then uses the aftermath of the shattered bullets to chain-explode more than 20 bullets. If that were not enough, she even wields his scabbard like a sword and continues to knock down swarms of over a hundred light bullets that are approaching in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuooooooo ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the swarms of light bullets do not stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant dragon continues to shoot light bullets, letting its inexhaustible power take care of the second wave when the first wave is cut down, and the third wave when the second wave is shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat was clearly playing. Even humanity's foremost swordsman was not even a threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat mouth is  contorted into a dark smile, and Tiamat is  sprinkled with  innocent  malice, wondering how much more the toy in front of it eyes can take. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even in the face of Tiamat's never-ending wave of attacks, Shino continues to slash, slam down, and shatter the oncoming light bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  power  of  the  light  bullets  themselves  being  shot  out  was  also  gradually increasing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  number  of  light  bullets  that  had  slashed  through  more  than  five  in  a  single  blow  was gradually reduced to four, three, two, and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  last,  the  situation  had  reached  a  point  where  even  with  all  of  Shino's  strength,  he  could barely slice through one of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can barely hit it, you monster!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under  the  increasing  pressure  of  the  light  bullets,  Shino  continued  to  intercept  them, intentionally  pushing  her  physical  limits,  but  the  effects  of  the  rapid  drain  on  his  qi  were beginning to appear on her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The muscles in both arms begin to cramp, and she loses control of her torso. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I, the old me, would never have made it ....... Even in my prime, i don't see any way i can win.) The legs that had been holding on begin to lose strength, and an intense sense of fatigue sets in, as if all the blood in the body has been drained from the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-115"></a>Shino bit her lip as her body was becoming less mobile than she would like. The taste of rusty iron spreads in her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, this is what I get for being so shriveled up deep in the forest!" I am no better than my poor disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Severe fatigue eventually leads to loss of sensation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  of  all,  the  senses  of  taste  and  smell  disappeared.  The  taste  of  rusty  iron  that  had  been spreading in the mouth was no longer present, and the burnt smell scattered by the aftermath of the light bullets was also lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then came the loss of hearing and the sense of touch. As if paralyzed, the sensations in the skin and the hand holding the sword become fuzzy, and the sound of light bombs exploding at close range disappears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the vision gradually darkens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, Shino continues to wield her sword. If she is killed, Nozomu will be the next target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this death ....... But now my idiot disciples have escaped. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While accepting her own death, Shino strangely found her heart remained calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ah, I see. I myself enjoyed life with that idiot disciple more than I thought I would. ......) At first, she was disgusted by the gloomy Nozomu, as if she were looking at her past self, but before long, he had become a big part of Shino's life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If she were able to protect him like that, well, its okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as she was about to accept her own death, a voice that crushed her wishes came vividly to her ears, which should have been deafening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, the disciple's shouts make Shino's dying face turn even paler and whiter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Shino involuntarily looked in the direction of the voice, she saw that her disciple, whom she should have told to run away and thrown far away, was still there, contrary to her wishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You idiot, get the hell out of here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrl......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  face  of  Shino's  pleading,  Tiamat's  gaze  turned  again  to  Nozomu,  and  countless  light bullets rushed toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crap!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu now has wounds all over his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with the remaining strenght, he has no way to resist Tiamat's attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-116"></a>Shino concentrates all the qi she has into her right fist. Then she slammed her right arm, which was compressed to the utmost limit and shining brightly, into the ground with all her might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">qi-jutsu, nemitsu koushitsu (annihilation light). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A qi-jutsu in which qi launched into the ground is released at the feet of the enemy, launching it into the air and destroying it with a torrent of qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a qi-jutsu specialized for annihilation and destruction, with the greatest range of effect and power of any qi-jutsu possessed by Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light she released created a huge wall of light between Nozomu and the bullets, catching the swarm of bullets squarely in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Tiamat's light bullets quickly devour Shino's perishable impulses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino  pours  out  even  her  remaining  qi,  literally  burning  even  her  life,  as  she  desperately struggles to hold off the light bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But reality was ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several light bullets pierced through the gap in the torrent of qi, which had been slightly slowed by the sudden depletion of qi, and penetrated the perishable light bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a tail of light trailing, the voracious light bullets bares its fangs at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, stop ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Shino's face was  stained with despair, the  light bullet struck the motionless Nozomu, blowing his body away like a leaf from a tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  body  was  thrown  into  the  air  by  a  direct  hit  from  a  light  bullet,  and  after  a  few seconds in the air, he slammed to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gg, aggghh......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to even let out a scream from the extreme pain, Nozomu writhed around, letting out a bitter cry of agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  light  bullet  that  hit  him,  pierced  through  Nozomu's  body,  and  blood  continued  to  flow unceasingly from the wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body rapidly loses heat, and instead a dense, deadly atmosphere envelops his entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  felt  the  presence  of  death  when  he  was  attacked  by  the  wild  dogs,  but  this  time  it  was incomparably thicker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The massive blood loss had severely impaired Nozomu's brain function, depriving him of the ability to even think about running away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Die ......I'm ...gonna…. die) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-117"></a>Nozomu's mind is filled with the reality that will surely befall him in the next moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A conviction of death so intense that it cannot be compared to anything he have ever  tasted before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(No......I hate it. ......)  </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that sickened him was the rejection of the reality that confronted in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  strong  presence  of  death  and  the  rejection  of  his  bare  instincts  that  normally  hidden, instantly  shattering  the  ice  in  the  heart  that  had  been  stagnant  due  to  the  conflict  and  cold treatment from his childhood friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I don't want to die.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once all excuses and escapes from the reality that is not good enough have been erased, the next thing that springs up is a crazed thirst for life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intense urge and energy for life rages like an active volcano, burning the last of the life within him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I don't want to give up!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light is increases as the light is extinguished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong will to live was emitted like a flash of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stands up with a scream that is hard to believe to be human, and then he rushes to the giant dragon that is messing up with his lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  tormented  light  in  Tiamat's  eyes  grows  stronger.  Tiamat  senses  that  this  is  the  last resistance  that  Nozomu  can  make,  and  the  giant  dragon  is  taking  pleasure  in  imagining  to crushing that resistance with all it might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five-colored flames lit up the mouth cavity of the giant dragon. It was about to breathe out a breath of extreme flame that created the huge crater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  running  toward  Tiamat,  but  while  he  was  unable  to  close  even  a  tenth  of  the distance to the giant dragon, a breath of extreme fire was released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(slow ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of the approaching extreme flames, Nozomu's concentration is at its highest limit, stretching his sensory time many times over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the stagnant time, he was frustrated by his own slow movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why am I so slow?!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-118"></a>It was always the case. This dullness, this weight as if his whole body were bound by chains, has always refused Nozomu's attempts to move forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And even now, this is how it binds and prevents Nozomu's entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no way to avoid the huge flame of death that looms before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu looked down at his body in impatience, he saw chains that he had never seen before entangled all over his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible  chains  that  holding  a  pale  light.  Chains,  which  do  not  appear  to  be  heavy  at  first glance, bind Nozomu's body firmly, as if they are trying to not let the sinner escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It's your fault!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinctively convinced that these chains are his fetters this entire time, Nozomu puts his hands on the chains that bind his entire body, trying to tear them off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  normal  course  of  events,  it  would  not  be  easy  to  shred  a  chain  with  one's  hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the sudden  appearance of the  glowing chains  would be considered some kind of hallucination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, for some reason, Nozomu was certain that the chains was definitely there, and that chains could be torn off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Don't get in my way ...... Aaaaaahhh!) </p>

 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/LZ3ShN6/000007.jpg" alt="000007" border="0"></a>
 
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-120"></a>When  Nozomu  pulled  the  chain  with  force,  it  made  a  crumbling  sound  and  the  chain  loop popped off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shredded invisible chains fly through the air and disappear like powder snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next  thing he knew, he was  accelerating in  an instant  and ducking under the oncoming Tiamat's breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary  to  the  unstoppable  bleeding,  Nozomu's  body  is  filled  with  more  energy  than  ever before and instantly responds to his thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The acceleration was so great that Tiamat lost sight of Nozomu for a moment. He put all his strength into that one-thousandth opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sheathes his sword as he runs under the extreme flames. He then sends all his energy into the sword and compresses it to extreme sword. He pulls out the sword  that compressed with qi from his scabbard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu-Phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The qi, thinner than hair and sharply compressed, flew at the same speed as the drawn sword and landed on Tiamat's left eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuooooooooooooooo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat  roared  at  the  counterattack,  which  Tiamat  had  not  even  considered,  and  reflexively lifted it head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's phantom landed in Tiamat's left eye, but unfortunately, it did not even slice through Tiamat cornea of the eyeball. The legendary  Dragon King of Destruction is an opponent on different scale of existence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the attack on the eyeballs upset Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although dragons are a type of spirit species, they have a physical body, have a mass of source elements, and have a biological aspect as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, they also take reflexive defensive actions that humans and other animals take, such as sheltering a sensory organ that has been strongly stimulated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guo-Guo-Guuuooooo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat, who was unexpectedly struck back by the delicate sensory organ in the eye, lifted it paw and stomped on the ground in a tantrum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huge paws pound the ground over and over again, each time causing a localized earthquake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rushes to get out of Tiamat's way, but the tremors are so strong that he is caught flat-footed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is stuck in that situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the next moment, the ground caved in, and Tiamat's huge body entered the hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-121"></a>"Gwuaaauwuwww!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Tiamat stepped through a cavity that existed in the underground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat struggles to get out of the hole, but the huge body slows the dragon down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barrage of claw strikes stopped, and Nozomu stepped in to close the distance again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, the walls on the giant dragon is thick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment Tiamat's right eye caught sight of Nozomu, a swarm of light bullets formed at a speed of less than a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are more than a thousand of them. The king of spirits, who wields the supernatural power of spirit magic, commands the wives and children to defeat the insolent humans while Nozomu takes three steps forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A thousand light bullet swarms shot out. There is no time to avoid them, no time to intercept either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Excessive force directed at a single person rushes in to tear Nozomu's body apart at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I won't let you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the forces charge was stopped by an unexpected figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, Nozomu's master, slams her qi-filled right arm into the ground again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu, annihilation light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, a torrent of qi erupted from the ground, obliterating the first of the light clusters that had rushed to Nozomu and crushing the following ones after the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, Shino's "annihilation light" flexibly changes its emanation point in accordance with Nozomu's  sprint,  precisely  piercing  a  swarm  of  light  bullets  and  creating  a  path  between Nozomu and Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu runs on that path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had removed the fetters of his ability suppression, was running faster than even his master, Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ggaaaaaaahhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it still does not reach Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu ran through the swarm of light bullets, the figure of Tiamat, who had created a huge flame in its oral cavity, right in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragon's  Breath,  too,  is  essentially  spirit  magic.  The  spirit  simply  wishes  for  it,  and  it  will manifests itself as an event without chanting or magic circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-122"></a>And Tiamat's was completely being counterattacked, out of frustration with the resistance of the diminutive little human being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat pours it power into the five-colored giant flame that the dragon has previously created, as if want to blow up the world itself, in which Tiamat is enclosed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the cause of the Giant Dragon's defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the giant flame of Tiamat emitted a single strong glow, thud! then the whole world trembled like a beating heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, the desolate earth began to glow white, and a huge magic circle was drawn that seemed to cover the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Shino was confused, the magic circle painted in the sky emitted a pulsating white light, and a ray of light shot out from the center of the circle toward the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the pillar of light falling from the heavens was Tiamat, a giant dragon with five colors and six wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuuuuhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A stifled anguish comes from Tiamat's mouth. The huge flame that had been produced in his oral cavity then instantly loses its power and becomes smaller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sense  of  intimidation  that  had  overflowed  from  his  entire  body  faded,  and  his  massive scales lost their luster and power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it possible, the world itself is blocking Tiamat power!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to affirm Shino's yell, Tiamat's power is significantly lost with each beating pillar of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the world created to seal Tiamat. It was only natural that there would be a function to suppress the power of the giant dragon when it out of control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this moment, Tiamat, weakened by the sealing function, had been reduced in strength to the rank of S in terms of human rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go on, you stupid disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rushes at the opportunity of an one thousand chances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, the sword is retracted, and qi is sent in for extreme compression. When the time is up, he pulls out his sword and flashes it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The released qi-jutsu phantom slashes through the weakened scales at Tiamat's throat, and the compressed  qi  explodes  inside.  The  burst  of  qi  blasted  the  jet-black  scales  from  the  inside, exposing the soft skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuoohhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-123"></a>Nozomu's follow-up shot is released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if tracing the trajectory of the previous unannounced strike in reverse, the returning flash of the sword turns on the exposed skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat's neck is slashed deeply, and a large amount of blood gushes out like hot water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaahhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat screams from the intense pain of a deep throat wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  even  a  wound  that  would  be  fatal  to  an  ordinary  demonic  beast  is  not  enough  to defeat the jet-black dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  uses  the  momentum  of  the  return  blow  to  turn  his  body  around.  Combining  the momentum of his leap, he thrusts into the wound on the neck that he had just slashed open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword thrusts deep into the neck of the giant dragon, the sword completely buried in the flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Nozomu  charged  so  vigorously  that  he  ended  up  dangling  in  mid-air,  supported  by  the sword he had thrust in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gguuuuuuuuuuuuuuuoooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, the dragon does not fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It roared so loudly that it shook the earth and went on a rampage in an attempt to shake Nozomu off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword is buried in the flesh and cannot be pushed or pulled. At this rate, it will be shaken off, and a bloody red flower will bloom on the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, using the last of his strength, secured himself with his legs and the hilt of his sword, which was firmly embedded in his body, and concentrated all of his remaining qi in his right arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's over!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raises his right fist and slams it into the hilt of the sword, releasing the qi that had been concentrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next moment, the qi-jutsu, Annihilation light, is released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dazzling light,  a huge qi  explosion rushes out.  The burst of qi,  comparable to  upper level magic, passed through the sword of the sword and blew off all bundle of nerves from the flesh of Tiamat's neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon's huge body falls to the ground, and the impact throws Nozomu's body off to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-124"></a>Tiamat's body is moving slightly, though a great deal of blood is flowing from his neck, but the eyes is no longer have a spark of life in them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, the dragon's massive body collapses, becoming a particle of light that soars like a tidal wave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looks up with a stunned expression at the particles of light soaring into the heavens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu lost a lot of blood. His body also can no longer move a single finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wounded all over. His limbs are fortunately attached to his body, but not a single part of his body is intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Particles of light shot up to the heavens, gathered above Nozomu, and fell upon him with a fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wounded all over and unable to move, he is swallowed by the oncoming torrent of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, you idiot disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the voice of his teacher calling in the distance in his ears, Nozomu, who had been pushing his limits, finally lost consciousness and fell into the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is dreaming. Nozomu had no idea where he was, but at least he guessed he was in dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A pitch-dark space with no way to see around. He is the only one standing alone in the middle of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  no  feeling  of  the  ground,  and  the  ripples  rising  from  both  feet  helped  Nozomu understand the unusual state of being standing on the surface of water all alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The darkness that fills his vision goes on forever, and not even the wind is blowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is nothing but ripples spreading out, just a world of silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, Nozomu checked himself and noticed invisible chains entangling his entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chain that he torn off when he faced Tiamat in the sealed world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, one end of the chain dives beneath the surface of the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">he looked down at his feet and peeked at the end of the chain extending below the surface of the water and saw a huge shadow crouching at the bottom of the dark lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge, jet-black frame body and five-color and six-wings. It was undoubtedly Tiamat, the Dragon King of destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noticing Nozomu looking down, the giant dragon stares at him, looking up at the surface of the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible  chains  extending  from  Nozomu's  body  were  entangled  in  the  dragon  huge  frame, restraining it entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat's gaze looking up collides with Nozomu's, and the giant dragon's eyes turn to strong color of vindictiveness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-125"></a>Tiamat says nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, through the connected chains, a freezing chill runs through Nozomu's entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is as if he is climbing up a precipice with a single untied rope. The chains that bind Tiamat through his body. It is undeniably convinced that this is the lifeline that has been broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu  and Tiamat looked at  each other in  silence, the surroundings  gradually became brighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The time to wake up is near. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, a little relieved that he is still alive, shifts his gaze to the dragon again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dragon is still staring at Nozomu, but he still has a dark vindictive light in those eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, a single strong white light shines on the dark lakeside, enveloping one person and one dragon in a soft glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  awoke  from  his  dream,  surrounded  by  white  light,  with  a  touch  of  anxiety  about Tiamat, who was chained to him with the same chains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, you're awake." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu woke up, the first thing that caught his eye was a close-up of a wrinkled old woman's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, peering at him from a close distance with hollow, glazed eyes, involuntarily screams and jumps off the futon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uwahhh, monster!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's you calling monster? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In next moment, a powerful fist strike slammed into Nozomu's face. He was blown away by the impact and slammed against the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was in such intense pain throughout his body that he sprawled on the spot, unable to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"ughh, Shisho, you're the worse. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which  one  of  us  is  worse!  I  went  to  the  trouble  of  bringing  you  back  from  the  forest  and nursing youfor three days!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  words  "three  days,"  Nozomu's  eyes  widened  involuntarily.  He  was  told  that  in reality, a considerable amount of time had passed, though it had been less than three days in his dreaming senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprised, then he look  around. A hut built  of wood. A simple interior  with minimal  living facilities. It was definitely the inside of hut. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-126"></a>Nozomu looks down at the body and sees that the whole body is bandaged and there is a strong medicinal scent in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Shisho. Thank you very much for treating me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, indeed! You're making me worry about something I don't need to worry about. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's  cheeks  are  still  puffed  out  in  frustration,  but  her  mouth  is  relaxed  with  relief  that Nozomu is safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, felt his own heart warm slightly at her mentor's clumsy smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  Nozomu  was  concerned  about  Shino's  physical  condition.  She,  too,  must have  been  considerably  worn  out  from  fighting  the  giant  dragon,  and  she  might  have  been injured in some unknown way, he thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is Shisho okay, injured or otherwise?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I was a little over reckless, but it's all right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the way Shino waved her hand in a light, platonic tone, she did not appear to be seriously injured. Nozomu lets out a small breath of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now,  you've  been  unconscious  for  three  days.  I  have  a  lot  to  tell  you  about  your  current condition. ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere in Shino changes drastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu naturally straightened his back in the atmosphere of a master who had reached the ultimate level of mastery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... got it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, let's start with the whole story. You defeated Tiamat in that sealed world." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sealed World?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The world that created by the Dragon Tribe to sealed away the Dragon King of Destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  existence  of  Tiamat  itself  already  only  in  the  legend,  and  the  sealed  world  has  been unknown. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How did we get into a place like that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. If you are of the dragon tribe, you may understand, but if you are not a spirit, you wouldn't know what it is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying this, Shino shrugs her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  defeated  Tiamat  and  took  its  power  and  became  the  Dragon  Slayer.  A genuinedragonslayer who has not been seen in hundreds of years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dragon Slayer ....... I'm......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Shino's words, Nozomu is consumed by a whirlwind of bewilderment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-127"></a>"Of  course.  Dragon  slayers  are  legend.  Even  the  most  recent  dragonslayer  lived  several hundred years ago." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  last  time  it  is  clearly  inscribed  in  history  is  when  it  appeared  at  the  founding  of  the Cremazzone Empire three hundred years ago, and it does not exist at the present time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest inheritor. The embodiment of immense power. Some use magic that cannot be explained  by  nowadays  existing  magic,  and  others  have  awakened  to  inexplicable  powers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are the kind of beings that only appear in such fairy tales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One more thing to make sure of...... take it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a pop, she tossed Nozomu's favorite sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally taht is one of Shino's own swords, it has been his favorite item since he became her apprentice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My sword? uwahh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment Nozomu received the thrown sword, Shino suddenly drew her sword and slashed at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to catch the swinging sword with his sword, which he has pulled halfway out of its scabbard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just as he was about to pull the sword out of its sheath, pain shot through both of Nozomu's arms, which had been injured in a monstrous way, and his reaction was delayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As his master's sword looms over his head, Nozomu sees that he is clearly not going to make it in time, as both of his arms freeze for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, however, contrary to Nozomu's expectations, with a high-pitched metallic sound, he had caught Shino's slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"as i thought." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu lets out a distracted sound, Shino, with a satisfied expression, returns the drawn sword to its sheath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean, Master?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  bewildered voice echoed through the small  hut.  The  abilities restricted by  ability suppression greatly affect spur of the moment actions. In Nozomu's case, he lacks instantaneous muscular power and his air capacity is also limited, so simple movements often fail to prevent him from being struck unexpectedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Being the Dragon Slayer has increased your physical capabilities." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-128"></a>Normally, he would have been cut down in time, but somehow he was able to prevent it. The reason for this was simply that his ability, which should not have increased, did increased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But I..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is true that  your physical abilities have not improved because of the suppression of your abilities. she said. "I had no choice but to use walking and breathing techniques, but it is said that a dragon slayer inherits the dragon's power and becomes even stronger. It is quite possible that this will happen to you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  Shino's  words,  Nozomu  looks  at  his  hands,  holding  and  opening  them  as  if  to  check something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ability  that  should  not  have  been  increased  was  increased.  Nozomu  was  beginning  to realize that he had become a dragonslayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Though it doesn't seem to be much ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu's elation was doused with cold water by his master's continued words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looks even more puzzled by Shino's statement, which could negate the legend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The effect of the suppression of abilities must have been very significant. It seems that even the increased ability is firmly suppressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Shino, Nozomu's abilities, which have been raised to a higher level, are being suppressed by his ability suppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, she says, the increase in physical capacity is not as great as she expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see, that you were able to release your ability suppression during the battle with Tiamat, can you do it now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The master's words brought back to Nozomu's mind the battle with Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, at that time, Nozomu recognized the chains that bound him and tore them off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steel wedge is released, and the feeling of freedom is so great that it seems as if you could go anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering  that  moment,  Nozomu  imagined  the  chains  that  bind  him.  Then,  the  chains wrapped around his body appeared in his vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">."Huahh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu yelps at the clearly visible invisible chains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It looks like you can do it. I've never heard of such a thing as release of ability suppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Convinced that Nozomu could release his ability suppression, Shino nodded his head in a small way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-129"></a>"So, what are you going to do now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What am i going to do?" ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is at a loss for an answer to this abrupt question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  power  in  the  outer  world  is  extraordinary.  Strong  power  attracts  many  things.  Status, honor, power, jealousy, and evil demons. The list is endless. ...... I ask you again, what are you going to do now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is stifled by the heavy pressure of Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He never thought about the future until now. He only thought about the present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, He can't even see the 'present'. He is still trapped, in the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just because he have released the chains of the body does not mean he has released the chains of the mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of his disciple, who was silent, Shino took the opportunity to speak the words he had been suppressing in the back of his mind for a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've thought about it for a long time," she said. "You have no reason to be any stronger." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not ............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For  your  lover?  That  girl  is  not  your  lover  anymore.  Even  if  you  want  to  support  her,  she doesn't think so. There is no reason for you to be strong. You knew that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu stammered and tried to find a way to escape, Shino assured him with a stern attitude and expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Furthermore, you didn't use any of the techniques I taught you at the academy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that's ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It cannot be used because it is too deadly. Before Nozomu could make such a statement, Shino put in a word for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is no need to use it against other people. If you use Phantom to target a wooden doll, any man can understand that you have a tricky technique. Besides, the sword art I taught you is very rare on this continent. If you were a master of it, at least you would not have fallen to the bottom of the tier." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teachers at the school ranked Nozomu as the lowest, partly because of ability suppression, but also because Nozomu never took any positive action to demonstrate his swordsmanship skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is only one reason why you have fallen to the bottom. It is because you ran away from facing reality and gave up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The underlying reason is escapism. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-130"></a>With relentless, straightforward words, Shino forces Nozomu to face what he has kept a lid on and unconsciously refused to think about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  couldn't  say  anything  back,  but  could  only  look  down.  He  could  not  say  anything back, but could only look down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, indeed, Nozomu also tried to resist those around him who denied him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the isolated environment somehow distorted his reasons for being strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, he broke his own vow himself and replaced it with a reason for escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he remained in the school, saying it was for Lisa's sake, but only trained with his sword and never went to see the person who was supposed to be at the center of the matter, was proof of this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it's impossible to make a decision on what to do right away," she said. " For now, you must concentrate on healing your wounds. You will have to make a choice eventually. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino says one last thing, nails it, stands up, and turns her back on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sure you can't go back to the city with that injury," she said. You can stay in this hut again today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu remains silent as he looks sideways at Shino, who has removed the sword from her waist and is putting it back on the sword hanger at the end of the hut. Confronted with his self-contradiction, his expression remained clouded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah right, I didn't tell you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She forgot something. Such lightly toned words echoed in the heavy air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  more  could  they  possibly  have  to  say  about  this?  As  Nozomu  looked  up  with  such  a feeling emanating from  his entire body, he suddenly felt his body being pulled away with a jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What's it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sudden force on the body, followed by a ton of ...... and a soft touch on Nozomu's cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked up and saw a smiling face of Shino in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome back ....... Good job." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's hand, holding Nozomu's body, slowly rubs Nozomu's back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked happy, really happy, her face was tearing up. A light of heartfelt relief flashed in her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as Nozomu could tell, Shino had not slept well after several days of all-night treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes were dark and her breathing was slightly erratic, showing the color of fatigue that she could not hide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took care of him and nursed him throughout the entire time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-131"></a>Her deep love gently melts his frozen heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's vision is distorted by the heartfelt affection he feels for the first time in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's ............ and ......hicks" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice fades and eventually becomes a sob, echoing through the empty forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino just kept holding him gently as he sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, his voice silenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rubbing Nozomu's back as he sobs in front of her, Shino continues to soothe him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shivering in her arms, he looked like a small child, so weak that it was hard to believe that he was the first dragon slayer to appear in hundreds of years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The breathing that hits the chest becomes gradually calmer and more regular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"take a sleep. It's okay. Your body and mind need rest. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tear trails remain around Nozomu's eyes as he sleeps peacefully. As she gently wipes away the glistening tears, Shino thinks of her sleeping disciple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I wondered how much my heart had been constricted and exhausted as I struggled on.) Shino is not originally from a country belonging to the continent of Arkmill, but from an island nation in the far east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her birth family, Mikagura, is one of the most prestigious swordsmith families in the Far East, and Shino was born as the second daughter of the family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, she quickly became absorbed in the art of swordsmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some people made fun of her for wielding a sword as a woman, but her father trained her as her wished, and her sister and mother agreed with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her sister was especially fond of Shino and always took her side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  best  environment  of  the  Mikagura-sword  style,  Shino  was  able  to  learn  the  art  of swordsmanship from an early age, and she quickly showed her talent for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  the  time  she  was  over  ten  years  old,  there  was  no  one  to  beat  her,  and  by  the  time  she reached adulthood, she was the best swordsman in the Far East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had fought in many battles, won them all, and was praised by all for her brilliant war record and personally praised and rewarded by the noblest person in the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  time,  Shino  also  experienced  an  outpouring  of  love  with  a  young  man  who  was introduced to her as a disciple by her beloved sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as a result of confirming their feelings for each other, they are bound together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-132"></a>He  is  a  member  of  a  distinguished  family,  and  has  the  ability  and  honor  of  an  ancient  and unparalleled person. He also experienced love, and was blessed with a good match with the person with whom he fell in love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was truly the height of happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this happiness was fragile and crumbled at the marriage, which was supposed to be the most glamorous time of the year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the wedding ceremony, Shino and the groom exchange a wedding cup, but Shino is accused of unjustified adultery, and the festivities are thrown into chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, false evidence broke off the marriage proposal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, Shino pleaded her innocence. But no one was willing to listen to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A year later, Shino learns the real culprit behind her downfall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was her sister, whom she adored, who brought Shino down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  older  sister  had  an  unrequited  love  for  a  man  who  was  in  love  with  Shino,  and  out  of jealousy she tricked the younger sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her sister mutters vindictive words in her sister's ear as she grabs up a stunned Shino by the hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I heard about your marriage to him, I made up my mind. I decided that I would never forgive you! I'm going to take away everything you have! I will undermine your position, your honor, everything  you have, and  I will make sure that  you  will never be  happy  as a human being again!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sister piles on further. "There is no place for you in this house anymore. No one will protect you, no one will help you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, she strikes words of despair with a sneer as she beats her battered sister to the tatami mats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"see you later, Shino. Don't worry, I'll be with him for the rest of my life." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She brushed off her sister's hair, which was torn off and tangled in her fingers, with a look of deep depression, and then she turned on her heel  and left  the room without  looking back at Shino, who had collapsed on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having lost everything, and having exhausted his mind and body over the course of a  year, Shino could do nothing but cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three days later, Shino left the Mikagura house without telling anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  story  was  known  throughout  the  country,  and  she  continued  to  drift  away,  never  to  be found anywhere else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She left the city, left the country, crossed the sea, and arrived at this spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-133"></a>A  foreign  land,  untouched  by  living  being.  She  settled  there  and  continued  to  live  without communicating with anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Y(ou and me are remarkably similar) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rubbing  the  back  of  his  sleeping  disciple,  Shino  spoke  to  herself  with  a  deeply  moved expression on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">they are both similarly abandoned and cast down. At first, she saw her past selves in her disciple and loathed it, but now he were irreplaceable and unique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The expression on the face of the sleeping disciple is calm and filled with relief, as if he has found his lost place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such an expression on her disciple's face made Shino's face break out, too, ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ughh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain that suddenly hit Shino painted a gentle smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her vision was distorted and her head was so foggy thatsheI almost couldn't stay conscious. A sense of dread enveloped her entire body, as if she had been submerged in a lake of ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ughh, you clunky body ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a strong effort, she somehow manages to connect with his consciousness, which is about to disappear. The distorted vision gradually regained its outline, but Shino's expression showed a color of fatigue that could not be hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I can't recover my depleted qi. On the contrary, it is lost as if being scraped by a planing saw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">...... Sleeping death?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sleeping death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A disease in  which the  qi  of the afflicted person gradually  declines  and leads  to  death.  The cause is  said  to  be the use of qi  beyond its  limits,  which causes serious damage to  the very foundation of the body that sustains life force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is only one reason why Shino suffered from sleeping sickness. When she fought Tiamat, she used excessive qi to protect her disciple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I thought i was healed, but my body was more broken. Truly, the world is a slippery slope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  have  been  only  a  few  cases  of  sleeping  sickness  being  cured,  and  no  cure  has  been identified. If this continues, the qi, the source of life, will drain from Shino's body, and she will eventually die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there is no fear of death on Shino's face; what comes to mind is regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I wish I had more time to talk to you. I teach you swordsmanship ......, as is typical of me.) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-134"></a>Looking at Nozomu sleeping in her chest, she smiles at the warmth coming from her disciple's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(There is one last thing I want to tell you and I want to tell you. At that time ...... all the best </p>
<p class="calibre1">......You must) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last thing left to her after losing everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While making his decision in front of him, Shino gently continued to stroke the back of her sleeping diciple. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">One week after the battle with Tiamat. Nozomu was treated by his master and was somehow able to go about his daily life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The medicine that Shino used to treat Nozomu was her original, and while it does not have the rapid recovery power of commercially available potions, it does increase the body's ability to heal itself without strain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been used in the training with Shino up to now, and Nozomu has been quite taken care of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, what puzzled Nozomu was Shino's attitude. Whenever he complained, he was  met  with  a  barrage  of  abusive  epithets  and  the  finest  martial  arts  in  the  name  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">"chastisement," but the words now had a strange wavering quality to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also began to show an oddly anxious attitude, and even began to act in ways she had never shown before, such as accompanying Nozomu, now able to walk, to town when he returned to Arcazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho, we have arrived at Arcazam." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shino pause when they come to the front of the city gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ummm, well ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, thank you for the escort." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, well. I am your master. It is natural to worry about an injured disciple." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino nods in a good mood at her disciple's auspicious bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But then again, it's still a big city when you look at it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino mutters as she looks up at the gates of Arcazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gate where Nozomu and his group are now is one of several  gates on the outer wall of Arcazam, and in terms of size, it is half as small as the main gate on the south side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the gate, nearly ten meters high, is majestic enough to interest even a once well-placed person like Sino. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-135"></a>"Shisho never entered Arcazam ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. I didn't want to go near this city when it was being built or after it was built. ...... Maybe it was wasting my time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho, would you like me to show you around the city for a bit?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's...... No good. You have school, too, don't you? You've been absent without notice for over a week. Isn't that causing all kinds of problems?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It may well have been ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't it? go, go, go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... got it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following Shino, who entered the city first, Nozomu also went under the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They walked together along the path leading from the gate to the central park and then to the Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun was already rising and many stores were noisily starting their day's business on the streets leading to the central park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the store, shoppers negotiate prices with the owner in front of an array of products. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, what's that bright red powder? This one is from ....... It looks like a cat's claw. I wonder what kind of seeds they are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's gaze turns this way and that with interest as she looks at the goods displayed in the stall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  surprised  by  this  unexpected  reaction,  but  at  the  same  time,  he  felt  nostalgic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he first came to this town, he, too, had been struck by the array of never-before-seen items on display in the stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two walk along the street, admiring the stores that line the streets, and eventually reach the central park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the green-covered park, the huge white building of Solminati Academy peeked out from the trees,  and looking around the vast park, one could see glimpses of students on their way to school, dressed in white uniforms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, this is as far as I'll go. Nozomu, I am returning to the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. Thank you, Shisho." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu bows to his master who drove him here, Shino shrugs her shoulders as if she doesn't mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  moment,  the  bell  in  the  steeple  tower,  the  tallest  building  in  the  school  and  clearly visible  from  where  Nozomu  and  his  friends  are  standing,  rumbled!  and  began  to  play throughout the city. It was time for the morning assembly to begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-136"></a>"Oh no, I'm going to be late!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the bell ring to start the morning assembly, a look of frustration comes over Nozomu's face. His grades are originally at the very bottom of the class, and he does not want to receive any negative marks for his attitude toward life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think you need to worry about it now since you've already been Absent for almost a week. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as Shino said, Nozomu has already been absent without leave for a week, so there is no doubt that he has a very bad reputation in terms of his classroom attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this case, he either reopened his mind that his reputation would be at its worst anyway, or he still persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was about to run toward the school building to avoid any more negative points when he heard his master talking nonsensically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyway! I'm going now. Shisho, then ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yes. After class today, come back to my hut. We still have a lot to talk about. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The end-of-year examinations at Soluminati Academy are important in determining the ranks to which students will belong in the following year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students are examined based on the results of two main tests: a practical test and a written test.  Since  this  test  determines  the  next  year's  treatment,  all  the  students  take  the  test  very seriously and give it their all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even students in the higher ranks are dropped to the lower ranks if their grades are poor, and if they do not meet the predetermined grades, they are flunked without question, or in the worst case, expelled from the school. This is a big problem for Nozomu, whose grades have been stagnant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, He's not sure that he should ignore the offer of a master who has been a great help to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Nozomu, it is certain that he cannot ignore his master's words, and more than anything else, he really feels that the two of them now have a kind of solidarity that he cannot ignore without insulting it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's ...... to talk about? Do you still want to talk about it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll tell you later. Look, the bell has rung. I think we're running out of time, don't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I thought it was Shisho who stopped me! Oh, God!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Nozomu shakes off his master and runs toward the school building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After watching his disciple disappear behind the school's main gate, Shino begins to turn back the way she just came. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-137"></a>"A new, foreign city. I'm not happy cause I don't have my disiciple to guide me, but let's walk around a bit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">For starters, she enjoyed walking the streets for the first time in decades, peering into the nearby stalls for a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's unexcused absences were ruled unexcused because his homeroom teacher, Caskell, did not specifically ask him the reason for his absences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally,  the  teacher  had  no  interest  in  tenth-grade  students,  but  he  completely  neglected Nozomu, and he began his morning class after finishing filling out the attendance sheet in a non chalant manner, without even asking why he was absent at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other students did not ask Caskell, and the other students are the ones he despises as the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't want to be noticed as a sarcastic teacher as a result of raising his voice, so he seemed to have taken the liberty of assuming that it wasn't a great reason anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The morning class ended in this manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the classroom,  all were able to fool him into believing that it were not, but Nozomu was subjected to relentless pursuit outside of the classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun,  you  are  hiding  something,  right?.  It  is  indeed  unusual  for  you  to  be  absent without permission for a week~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one person who didn't fooled was Anri Var, an assistant classroom teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she learned that Nozomu was coming to school for the first time in a week, she called him to the staff room during lunch break and began questioning him directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It’s okay, it's nothing serious," he said. "I was simply attacked by a Demonic Beast when I entered the forest and was injured. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It must be a big deal! What kind of Demonic Beast attacked  you~? It  is true that powerful Demonic Beasts are unlikely to appear near the roads, but even so, it is not absolute! We need to know where and what kind of Demonic Beasts attacked you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think it was Mad Bear ......? The location, I don't remember exactly, but it was roughly east of Spasim Forest, I think. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that three brothers?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" Yes, it is. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tried his best to make things right, but the suspicion in Anri's eyes gradually deepened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How about your wound?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-138"></a>"I had a fever that put me in bed, but I'm fine now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to ask you one more question, why did you go absent? Nozomu lives in a dormitory, so you can contact the school, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  fever  was  worse  than  I  thought,  and  I  couldn't  move,"  he  said.  "And  I  don't  have  any classmates at this school who care about me. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself said this line himself, which made he sad, but it was completely true, because in reality, Nozomu is literally at the bottom of the pile between the two year, and he is not even in the party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also feels guilty about lying to Anri, but he cannot tell the truth. He tries to cover up the guilt that is tingling inside of him and somehow manages to get away with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Uhhhh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, suddenly, Anri started crying. Nozomu's voice was filled with bewilderment at this sudden turn of events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"what's going on all of a sudden?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huahhhh! Nozomu-kun doesn't believe me~! I don't care about this unreliable half-breed~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? No, it's not. Why are you talking like that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Because you won't tell me the truth~! The three mad bears were defeated by Irisdina about ten days ago, and although I can't see it clearly, your bodies move as if you were wounded, and the scent of the medicine used to treat you is not one that is available in this town~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Anri pointed this out, Nozomu involuntarily paled. Although the wound was closed, the effects of the injury still left a subtle discomfort in Nozomu's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri had noticed Nozomu's unconscious action of protecting his wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, she had noticed by smell alone that the drugs used to treat Nozomu were not the kind commonly available on the market. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, it was impossible to begin with, since Nozomu's lies are also quite full of holes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  he  still  could  not  tell  her  the  truth.  The  battle  between  Nozomu,  who  tries  to somehow cover it up, and Anri, who cries and tries to question Nozomu, continues for a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, let's talk ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri looks at Nozomu with tears in her kind eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little older, a stunningly beautiful woman, pressed close to him, and Nozomu couldn't help but say, "Ugh ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  the sight  of a beautiful woman desperately  and sincerely  concerned  about  her students' </p>
<p class="calibre1">well being attracts all men and women, young and old. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-139"></a>The face was so dangerously attractive that a man, especially a young man of his age, would do anything she said if he saw it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(She is the type of person who make men loses naturally, and she doesn't even know it!) Nozomu was no exception, and Anri's fascinating and bewitching gaze stirred a sense of guilt that smoldered deep in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun,............, won't you talk to me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, That ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, Anri's teary-eyed attack in the name of questioning ended with the bell for the start of class. Nozomu left the staff room as if to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was being pursued by Anri, Irisdina was having lunch in the central park with her  best  friend,  Tima,  and  her  sister.  The  three  of  them  were  at  a  bench  in  the  grass  area, overlooking all the stalls in the park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Onee-sama, have you and Nozom-san cleared up your misunderstanding?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Misunderstanding? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I met Nozomu-kun here a little while ago and we had a little chat, you know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina gave a brief explanation to Tima, who tilted her head at Somia's statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While looking for Somia in Central Park to have lunch together, she ran into Nozomu who was talking with her sister. After talking to her, she told Irisdina that he had helped Somia catch a cat she was looking for a while ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through this connection, they decided to have lunch together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Irisdina also spoke about the unintentional remarks she had made to Nozomu at that time. Even as she was explaining, Irisdina's eyes were glancing at the stalls lined up in the central park. Apparently, she is wondering if Nozomu will come out to buy lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that why Ai has been missing from lunch and after school lately? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  thought  it  would  be  bad  to  suddenly  barge  into  class,  so  I  waited  at  the  main  gate,  but  I couldn't meet him. It seems he has been absent from the school for a while. I wonder if he is here today. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While she is still chiming in on her best friend's story, Irisdina is checking out the faces of the people lined up in front of the stalls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was inwardly surprised by this. As far as she knew, Irisdina had never shown such interest in a single male student. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-140"></a>In the end, however, Nozomu never emerges from the main gate, and lunch break is over. As Irisdina puts away her lunch bag with a slumped shoulder, Somia suddenly makes a proposal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Onee-sama, would you invite Nozomu-san to my upcoming birthday party?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was taken aback by her sister's sudden mention. The birthday party originally planned for  Somia  was  a  private  affair,  and  the  only  guests  invited  were  Ecross'  friends  who  were particularly close to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san is  a friend of mine. He helped me  get  back this ornament that my onee-sama gave me. That's why I've wanted to thank you for so long." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia. ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san, even when he smile, he look somewhat lonely. I don't know what happened to him, but I, my friend, want him to smile a little. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia also knows about the rumors of Nozomu that are spreading in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But regardless of that, she wanted Nozomu to laugh heartily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I guess so. I want my friends to laugh. That's right. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The innocence of such a younger sister pushes Irisdina to the forefront. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina does  not  know about  Nozomu's past.  She can only imagine how  much he has  been driven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, he was only a person of interest. However, Irisdina, sensing a glimpse of the hard work he has accumulated, has also unknowingly come to sympathize with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  is  why  ahe  am  becoming  seething  at  the  fact  that  her  misunderstanding  has  not  been cleared up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia, I will talk to him and clear up the misunderstanding. Then I will invite him to your birthday party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! Thank you, Onee-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The interest and sympathy that had been building up in the back of her mind. And at the urging of  her  beloved  sister,  Irisdina  promised  to  invite  him  to  a  party  for  celebrating  her  beloved sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu managed to escape from Anri's pursuit during the lunch break and went straight to his afternoon practical class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While unwinding on the training ground, he let the condescending Caskell's words sink in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-141"></a>But Nozomu was chilled to the bone by the stares directed at him from the edge of the training ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"stare~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was Anri, who was assisting Caskell in a practical class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  an  assistant  classroom  teacher,  she  sometimes  participates  in  classes  in  this  way,  often directly assisting the homeroom teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in the tenth grade, there is at most one assistant instructor assigned to a class. There are not as many as in the first class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, on the other hand, let out a deep sigh so as not to be noticed by Anri, who stared at him so intently that he thought he could hear onomatopoeia. The class itself went on without a hitch, leaving these two aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students will demonstrate the ritual magic performed in the previous day's class, among other things, and finally, a mock battle will take place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  opponent  in  the  mock  battle  was,  of  all  people,  Mars,  another  tenth-grade troublemaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're out of luck, too. Well, you can't win no matter who you play against, so why should I worry about it? Hahahahahahahahaha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring Mars, who continues to provoke him, Nozomu picks up a mock sword at the edge of the training area and checks his own condition as he regulates his breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(my  Injuries  are  fine.  Even  though  there  is  some  residual  discomfort,  my  body  does  what  i wants to do.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took a swing of the mock sword in his hand. The feel of the sword on his arm is not so different from that of his own beloved sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the biggest concern. he look down at his own bodies and stare into his own eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible chains wrapped around the body rise into view, and if you reach out and grasp them, they return a jarring and certain feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Release it, i could ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of having ripped off the invisible chains that entangled his body in that sealed world still lingers clearly in Nozomu's arms. He was convinced that if he wished, he could unleash everything that had been suppressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But I'm not relesae it now ...... shouldn't be) </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even if that were possible, Nozomu was determined not to break these chains here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Tiamat, I dreamed of and a touch of anxiety I felt at the time. I had a feeling that something in me might be broken if I released it.)  </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-142"></a>These factors made him hesitate to release his wedge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(After that, it's this or ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering in his heart, Nozomu glances at his beloved sword, which he has placed at the edge of the training ground instead of a mock sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  comes  to  mind  is  his  master's  words,  "If  you  want  to  get  out  of  the  bottom  line,  you should use the techniques you have learned properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Shino said, Nozomu had never used the qijutsu he had learned in the academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Should i use it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hesitation arises in his mind, and a myriad of reasons for affirming and denying it overtake him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his homeroom teacher, Caskell, did not wait for Nozomu to clear his doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then begin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simultaneously with Caskell's call, the mock battle begins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a pause, Mars stepped in, and at the same time the ground beneath his feet popped with a burst of sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, using his flash step, approaches Nozomu with an acceleration that is hard to believe that he is carrying a large, heavy sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, from the very beginning, he probably wanted to crush Nozomu. He had already used qijutsu to strengthen his body as well as his flash step, and even from the side, his whole body was covered with a remarkable amount of ki. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu exhales a small huff ...... in front of the onrushing Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The jumbled thoughts clear in an instant, and consciousness is replaced with a snap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu found himself with his whole body in a state of alertness and readiness to intercept at an astonishing speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go fuck yourself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars swung a large sword from the upper level, which immediately transformed into a side cleave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strike is mixed with feints, appearing to be from above and cleaving from the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  uses  his  enhanced  physical  abilities  to  the  fullest,  spinning  his  body  to  gain momentum and launch the reaped great sword from below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The raised sword strikes the belly of Mars' great sword, and the reaction force from the earth, transmitted through both feet, deflects Mars' sword line upward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mwah...what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars frowns for a moment at the flowing, brilliant reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-143"></a>But he, too, responded immediately to Nozomu's interception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He corrects the trajectory of the great sword, which is bounced up, and this time he swings it down at Nozomu's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the great sword being swung down with all his might, Nozomu turns his wrist and holds his sword at an angle to the line of Mars' sword, and at the same time relaxes his right leg to catch the impact of the downward strike in a diagonal downward direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strike that was supposed to have the most power on Nozomu was passed over, and Mars' </p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes widened in astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A blow that until now has been too much influenced by ability suppression to deal with even if reinforced with qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, his physical capabilities, which had increased slightly after becoming a dragonslayer, enabled Nozomu to parry Marus's fiery blows without losing his stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, Nozomu is now beginning to use the skills he learned under Shino, albeit gradually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having finally found a refuge, his consciousness in the mock battle was no longer that of the school life he had spent like a puppet until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a clear sign of change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little by little, but surely, Nozomu's consciousness was beginning to change, as if a seed that had been sleeping under the ground for years and years had broken through the frozen earth and sprouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' mouth twists into a smile as Nozomu steps inside the greatsword's range, having passed the great sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu jumps into the pocket and flashes his sword at Mars' torso. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing that there was no time to draw back his greatsword, Mars repelled Nozomu's slashes with his gauntlets, just as he had done during the previous mock battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu has already anticipated this. The moment the slash is bounced off the gauntlet, he takes one more step, switches bodies, and strikes a powerful elbow strike to Mars' abdomen, one of the vital points of the human body, the water spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' face contorted in anguish and his body snapped back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An  impact  that  runs  into  the  diaphragm,  which  controls  breathing,  interferes  with  normal breathing and slows down the movement itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu holds the back of Mars' head as he drops his body and kneecaps him in the face. The feel of his nose bone runs into his knee, and Mars staggers back, his nose gushing blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-144"></a>Nozomu tries to follow up further on Mars, who steps on ground and falls back, but ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're so dead, bastard!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Mars' exclamation, a large amount of qi erupted. Nozomu was temporarily pushed out of the way by the forceful outpouring of ki. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, how much more plentiful qi did he have ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Nozomu  complained  about  his  opponent's  endowed  temperament,  Mars  glared  at Nozomu with an indignant expression on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is completely pissed off after receiving an unexpected counterattack from the weak who should have just crawled away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perish! You son of a bitch, I will tear you to shreds and crush you like a piece of dust trash!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, in a rage, began to send qi into the great sword. The qi that had been gushing out swirled around with the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Qi-jutsu?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the wind-bearing qi is poured into the great sword, it turns into a sword of furious wind and clings to the thick sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi jutsu, dust, wind, and sword dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  qi-jutsu  technique clings  a sword of wind around the body of the sword to  slice up an approaching object. The densely compressed wind is accompanied by a powerful pressure that unilaterally blows away poor defenses and attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the wind that surrounds it accelerates the speed of their slashes, further contributing to their increased power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To prevent this, he must have the physical strength to withstand both the sword of the wind and the slash of the great sword, as well as a strong defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' great sword, wielded in a kesake-sakagake (a kind of "sword-style") stance, closes in on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu avoids the weapon with its sword of wind by stepping backward to see its trajectory, but Mars steps in to close the gap between the two and unleashes a series of blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swords of wind attacked without a moment to catch their breath. Nozomu continues to dodge the oncoming barrage of blows as he slithers backwards and forwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has not been able to find an opportunity to counterattack in the face of Mars' slash, which, thanks to the qijutsu dust sword, has accelerated not only his sword speed but also his cutting ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now that he is in  control of his  anger, Mars's swordsmanship is more monotonous than during the previous mock battle, and he has no trouble reading two or three moves ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-145"></a>His slightly improved physical abilities have also greatly broadened Nozomu's fighting style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was beginning to prepare for his next move, feeling a certain growth in the fact that he could now see five moves ahead of his opponent's sword fight and the way he thought he could fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars was sounding puzzled and indignant in the face of the fact that his sword was not hitting at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What happening......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The slashes of Mars cut through the air with all the precision of Nozomu's bodywork, which was clearly different from the previous ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why can't my attack hit him!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had never been able to move as much as this before. He staggered when he was hit by a  sword,  and  his  evasive  maneuvers  only  resulted  in  him  rolling  on  the  ground  in  an unceremonious manner. Even if by chance he could have dealt a few blows, the result would have been the same, and he would have eventually fallen down in a heap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mars could not see such a result in Nozomu's movements now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The movement itself is slow, but the evasion is extremely precise. He is so sharp that it seems as if he can see not only the line of the sword but also each sword of the wind he wears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars not only had an abundance of qi, but also a particularly high aptitude for wind-associated chi techniques and magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  ability,  called  "Blessing  of  the  Wind  Spirit,"  is  limited  to  the  wind  attribute  and  greatly increases the power and accuracy of magic and qijutsu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the power and sword speed of the slash by the dust and wind sword should not have been ignored, even by an opponent of the same rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Mars' vision happened to catch the face of his opponent in front of him. There was no trace of impatience in his expression. Mars was convinced. He was sure that this man had completely seen through his own sword, which was supposed to have been strengthened by the dusty wind sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is imposible ......, imposible, imposible!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is at the bottom of the second grade. Mars, on the other hand, is at the top of his class in practical skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ranked B, he was confident that his sword would work even at the highest rank, the first grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-146"></a>At that moment, Mars suddenly remembered, once again, the abilities of the opponent in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ability suppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An ability that limits the person's abilities below a certain level. The man in front of me was supposedly limited by it to a certain amount of strength, energy, and magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder how much ability this man, who is able to see through his own sword while wearing such shackles, would have originally acquired. And how much training did this man have to go through in order to break through the barrier, even with such shackles on his back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">(............ I ain't gonna admit it. I ain't gonna admit it!) A man's ability to be invisible until now. Emotion painted over the warnings of reason, which had calmly judged it. The pride Mars had in his own power clouded his own eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was finally knocked slightly out of position by the continuous slashes of Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who had been impatient  before Nozomu's struggle, took  the opportunity to  swing his sword down with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was a trap set by Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the great sword was swung down, Nozomu instantly regained his stance and leapt backward. Mars' sword struck the ground with great force, and the sword of wind that had been wrapped around the sword raised up dirt around him, blocking his view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fuck you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impatiently, Mars releases the sword of wind that had been clinging to his sword, pointing it in the direction where he believes Nozomu was just now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">qijutsu, Ripped Dust-ram slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">qijutsu derived from dust sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword of wind released from the sword body become a mass and rush forward in a straight line like a battering ram. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mass of wind that was going straight ahead gouged the ground deeply and blew away the dust and smoke that had rolled up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But beyond the clear vision of Mars, there was no sign of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shit, where's him ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong chill runs through Mars' entire body, driven by impatience to find out where he has gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars slid his  gaze to  the right  side  and saw  Nozomu,  his  sword sheathed and poised at his waist, leaping into the fray. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-147"></a>The moment the cloud of dust from the Ripped Dust-ram covered his vision, Nozomu instantly put his qi into his feet and kicked the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with his whole body, he bent the trajectory of his flash step, which could only move in a straight line, and in an instant he was around the side of Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flash step - curved style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A technique that allows for complex curved movement on straight flash step At close range, their gazes  cross. Nozomu  is already in  a position to draw his  sword, while Mars is left exposed to a large gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars finds it impossible to evade. He quickly tries to defend himself with his gauntlets, but before his body can move, Nozomu's sword cuts him in the mouth with its compressed carp-like edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place where a wild storm was blowing, a quiet and tranquil tone echoed with the sound of the kin ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Mars' mind, he could clearly see the silver flash that passed from his right side to his left shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu's sword, which had been compressed, was never unleashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bell rang immediately afterward, signaling the end of the class, and the training hall rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The simulation is over. The final exams are coming up, so this is the end of today's class." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Caskell's order, the classmates exhaled loudly, released from the tension of the class, put away their respective gains, and returned to their classrooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, sheathes his half-drawn sword and turns on his heel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, I need to have a word with you. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, Anri-sensei, excuse me, I have some business to attend to today!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  being  stopped  by  Henri,  Nozomu  retrieves  his  beloved  sword  from  the  edge  of  the training ground and leaves the training ground at a run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars just watched his back without saying a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(He is definitely getting stronger. No, he was strong to begin with and we just didn't notice?) Suddenly, I felt heat caged in my nose and wiped it with my finger, and found blood on my palm, which had flowed out when my knee was struck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blood  that  flowed  out  of  the  body  once  again  made  Mars  realize  the  truth  of  what  had happened in front of his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What's with this fuzzy feeling? ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel unsettled. Anger wells up from deep within my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-148"></a>(Why? That he was hiding his abilities?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, it isn't. At least Mars did not feel anger toward Nozomu now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then to whom is this irritation directed? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yeah, against myself. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' mouth, lost in thought, naturally uttered such words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If there is no anger against Nozomu here, then there is only one other target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars had never been so angry with himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took pride in his strength. At the very least, he strongly disliked those who were weak and unable to do anything but sneak around behind his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  more  than  that,  it  was  the  ones  who  would  not  resist  and  accept  being  tortured  that  he despised the most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is exactly what Nozomu's attitude has been up to now. Even when treated as the bottom of the class, he accepted it without changing a single expression on his face. This is precisely the kind of existence that Mars detests the most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what was the reality? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and the others just didn't realize it, but Nozomu was more defiant than anyone else. He was trying to be strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he was now reminded that the effort was at a level that Mars could not even imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have never heard of anyone with ability suppression going beyond their limitations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To a man who was making such an effort, all he has done is to shout and ridicule me out of melancholy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mars. How was the dropout today?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's doing okay today, by the looks of it. Mars, I think you cut too many corners, no matter how much trouble it is for you to deal with him!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of his cronies approaching from behind make gibbering, grating sounds of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mars doesn't even look at them as they fuss behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While his cronies shrugged their shoulders and looked at each other at the unusual appearance of Mars, Mars continued to stare at the exit of the training hall where Nozomu had disappeared, feeling a strong sense of resentment toward himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the bell, Iris Dina runs swiftly through the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose is to find a male student who has not been to the school for the past week or so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No one here. Is the tenth grade have practical exercise?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-149"></a>After checking the empty tenth-grade classrooms from the hallway, Iris Dina headed for the main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because as long as they are not in the classroom, that is where they are most likely to meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is looking for Nozomu to clear up a misunderstanding in Central Park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rest of the time, I was also going to apologize for my rudeness in stepping into areas he did not want to be touched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's eyes catch sight of the school's large main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Solminati Academy is divided into various facilities, including student and faculty buildings where students take classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  she  exited  the  student  building  onto  the  street  leading  to  the  main  gate,  she  saw  a  male student running out from the street leading to the training area on the other side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A student carrying a very rare, eastern sword at his waist. It was definitely the person she was looking for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Nozomu-kun, can you just ...... me for a minute, please?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina raises her hand and calls out to him, but Nozomu is oblivious to her call and walks out of the school building through the main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why was he in such a hurry for?" Before the question even crossed her mind, a crumpled and dejected expression passed over Irisdina's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We couldn't talk again ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she lowered her raised hand, she let out a disappointed voice as she realized that she had missed her chance to apologize. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">After class, Nozomu immediately ran back to the shino hut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was really concerned about the end-of-year exams, and he didn't want Anri to pursue the matter any further, but I was also a little concerned about the state of Shino, who had told him to be sure to return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was concerned that the fight with Tiamat might have some effect on Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that she had never tried to approach Arcazam before, but had followed him to the city, saying she was there to escort him, was also stuck in Nozomu mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu arrived at Shino's hut, she was enjoying tea on the porch of the hut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a plate beside a teapot filled with tea are cookies made of flour, which are not particularly rare in the continent, as a tea snack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh~oh~, you comes Nozomu." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-150"></a>Shino, noticing Nozomu's return, waves her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been inwardly concerned about her health, was taken aback by the sight of Shino with a cup of tea in one hand and her cheeks puffed out like a squirrel with a cookie in the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's going on, Shisho? As he said in the morning, the final exams are coming up soon, and he have to catch up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not going to say it like that. Come with me today. you are not a man if you don't accept an invitation from such a beautiful woman." </p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1">
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's expression of bewilderment stiffens at his master's sudden line. His mouth tightened into a straight line, and he turned his gaze toward Shino as if he were staring at something that reeked of something fishy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Shisho. Are you drinking in the daytime?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think so. You know it when you see it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's mouth is twisted in dissatisfaction at Nozomu's words, but the edges of his words are strangely wavering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tilting his head at her master's words and actions, which were like a small boat bobbing in the waves, Nozomu picked up one of the cookies she was making for tea and sniffed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  smell  of  dark  alcohol  wafted  from  the  cookies,  which  had  dried  fruit  kneaded  into  the dough. If you look closely at Shino's face, you will see that his wrinkled face has turned slightly red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shiso, what's wrong with these cookies?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Oh, I bought it when I was in town because I saw it at a stall. It was hard to find such nectarous sweets in my hometown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This thing is the source. Shiso, you were weak on alcohol. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sake is inseparable from confectionery in terms of preserving, flavoring, and seasoning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even if it does contain alcohol, the amount is basically not enough to get you drunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's expression is indescribable at his master's other weaknesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Shino, drunk and in a good mood, took Nozomu's hand and tried to sit next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on, why don't you sit down next to me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aita ta ta ta! Shiso, don't pull the joint, it will break!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A scream of agonizing pain rises from Nozomu's mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it was an instinctive action, but Shino's arms were covered with a phosphorescent glow caused by her qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, arm strength enhanced with chi can easily destroy a person's joints. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-151"></a>Despite this, the fact that he was able to instinctively adjust the force to the point where it was exquisite, whether or not Nozomu's joints would break, was a testament to his skill and how much he was accustomed to hurting Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"ugh ...... Shiso you're terrible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Also, you may address such words to your mentor at ....... Do you not have more respect for your teacher?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, forced to sit down, is teary-eyed as he strokes his aching wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, on the other hand, was not happy with her apprentice, who was complaining and puffing his cheeks out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, looks miffed at Shino's lack of apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  it  was  because  after  the  fight  with  Tiamat,  she  cried  in  front  of  him,  exposing  her emotions  with  all  her  might.  The  distance  between  the  two,  who  had  only  been  master  and disciple, had definitely grown closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a very delicate distance, neither friend nor family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, they  had lost  a certain  reserve,  and  were able to  speak more directly  to  the other person. This is a way of being between people that both Nozomu and Shino had lost for a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I respect you. If only Shiso hadn't said something so vicious and fraudulent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute, who's vicisious and fraudulent? And when did I say that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shiso, you're lying when you say you're a beautiful woman. You are a former beauty!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is by no means a good idea to be unreserved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since they are both communicators to begin with,  an off-the-cuff word can touch the other's scales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............There's again,  my stupid disciple." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino puts on a devilish expression and puts her hand on the sword that was propped up on the porch. At the same time, a visibly deadly atmosphere rose from her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wild birds of the forest let out a cry that resembles a scream and flap their wings in unison, trying to get as far away from the scene as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm scared to death. With these thoughts in his mind, Nozomu was sweating cold sweat in front of his master's form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her hair stands on end, and her appearance is rightly that of a man-eating ogre. Considering her homeland, you should say night and forked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But, but i can't lose forever!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-152"></a>Nozomu, who has become less reserved now that they are closer to each other, is also aroused, remembering the torture he has undergone in the name of training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is always beaten up by the slightest joke, and even her joke is met with an instant death technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She can adjust her force to kill or not to kill, but she is completely unable to adjust her hand to the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  goodness  sake,  we  need  to  teach  those  who  are  fighting  against  this  law  of  equivalent exchange what it means to take it easy. Otherwise, they will never get out of the stupid state of fainting on a daily basis in their daily lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, I can't just bow down to an unreasonable Shisho forever either. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before he could finish his declaration of war, kin! With a sound of a air being cut, a sword is thrust into his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the....?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......You haven't even been to do it, The hindrance is clear, isn't it?~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of the kaha~ and the master spewing flames, Nozomu was  even sealed off from declaring war and surrendered wholeheartedly, raising his hands in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gut! And a fist bone is swung at Nozomu's brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You utterly don't know woman's heart. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oy, Shishou, what did you mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's nothing. Well, come with me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  a  beat  from  their  little  quarrel,  Shino  abruptly  began  to  talk  about  something inconsequential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The country of one's home. About her family. About what Shino have been doing since she came to this continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also wants to hear about Nozomu's story, and although he is still little lost, he begins to tell her a potpourri of his old stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His life in his home village, his parents, the events at the school, his heartbreak and fall, his meeting with his master and his training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the stories Shino already knew, but she still wanted to hear them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  nodded  and  continued  to  listen  happily  to  what  seemed  to  have  been  told  to  her  many times. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-153"></a>Shino exchange a few words with her disciple, as if she were to inscribe it on herself, as if she would never forget it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stories are very common. Where is your hometown? How is your family? What do you like? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such an ordinary conversation. They had never exchanged even such an ordinary conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the sword that teaches, and it is the sword that speaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swords, swords, swords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's all Shino had taught him, and that's all Nozomu wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A relationship that would make others a little sad if they heard it. However, Shino thought it was most like them and smiled wryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps that is why. Walking through the streets of Arcazam as a chaperone and just having a normal conversation like this was very refreshing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, she was happy to see her disciplel's colossal change of expression after hearing her story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She thought she would never again exchange words with people with this kind of feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, they were intentionally avoiding it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Nozomu unconsciously ran away from "desperate training" because he was "dumped by his lover" and "felt trapped in his current situation," Shino also ran away and turned away from "getting involved with others" because she was "betrayed by her family." </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This make me doesn't qualify to say anything to my disciple ......) Shino smiles self-mockingly, saying that she is a fool indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, she could not be more grateful to the disciple who adored such an ill-qualified teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite what she says with her mouth, even the unsuspecting Shino could tell that Nozomu trusts her. This disciple is also a person who, like Shino, is hungry for human connection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(If I had been born a few decades later, if my body had not been sick, ...... I would have wished to live with you.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A desire that Shino wished from the bottom of her heart. However, the bond that exists between them is not that of lovers, but that of teacher and student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was a little disappointing to her, but still, it is the last thing that can be left in Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's fine. That was enough. There was very little time left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'll give your place next ...... to someone who can walk with you.) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-154"></a>Shino look up at her diciple sitting next to her, pushing down the slight ache tingling in the pit of her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My discilpe, whom I thought was inexperienced, was much taller than I was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun is already setting and the landscape around the hut is turning red before long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then. Shall we begin your last training?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took one regretful glance at the sun disappearing behind the trees, and said those words as if she were going with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last Training. Nozomu looks puzzled, not quite understanding the meaning of the word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, Shishou that. The last one ............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's like I said. This is the last training I can give you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, despite his disciple's bewilderment, Shino's condition is the same as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an air of aloofness, she hopped down from the porch and staggered to the garden of the hut where they had always practiced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steps are the same as usual. However, Nozomu feels  an inexpressible uneasiness in his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll tell you why! What do you mean by last? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The last training is to kill ............ we will kill each other for real." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu could not understand what his master was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The unacceptable words in his head about who and who is going to kill each other are spinning like pulleys that have lost their gears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? Shishou, you're joking too far. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring  the  questions  of  his  disciple,  who  could  not  hide  his  agitation,  Shino  stood  in  the center of the garden and slowly held the sword in its sheath at her waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  eyes,  which  should  have  been  relaxed  by  the  idle  talk  just  a  moment  ago,  are  already hardened and her body is radiating a heavy high energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shishou, answer me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not going to say anything. Oh, my dear, what's the point of asking person who really wants to kill you to give a reason?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shishou!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu still continues to ask his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a nozomu who has trained so well that it is ridiculous to count that as shino training. It is easy to see that she is serious in the face of her supremacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-155"></a>But that didn't make it any less acceptable to the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Answer me! What do you mean, "last"? And what were you thinking, killing each other!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She doesn't say anything. Instead, she has demonstrated that intention with clear actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if Shino's body had momentarily blurred, a ferocious killing intense slammed into Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  moment,  she  was  already  right  in  front  of  Nozomu.  The  sword  sheathed  in  her scabbard is drawn, and she is coming at Nozomu's neck at a speed that does not even allow her to be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pssst!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defensive instincts, no longer rubbed into the core of his body, made Nozomu respond to the divine speed of the unannounced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reflexively, he bends down and rolls on the ground as if to escape from the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's slash cuts through the air, but she uses the momentum of her sword swing to unleash a spinning kick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly raised his right arm to receive the kick, but the kick, enhanced with qi, was so heavy that he was blown away and slammed into a tree growing at the edge of the open area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuaahh ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu frowned at the pain in his back, but biting his lip, he jumped back and drew his sword to avoid the follow-up attack. He bites his lip and jumps away from the spot to avoid the follow-up attack, and while holding his sword, he raises his voice again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shishou, what on earth do you want!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His master still says nothing, but simply and quietly points the tip of her sword at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her lips were closed in a straight line, but her eyes declared loudly, "I have nothing to say." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu bristles at the sight of Shino, who says nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His teacher was always like this. She never allowed Nozomu to ask questions during training, but always made one-sided declarations, and if he objected in any way, she would make him do twice as much training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even Nozomu, who had experienced such training, was clearly uncomfortable with the way Shino was looking now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This is Strange. Shishou has done things that 'could kill', but he has never tried to 'kill' me) But now she is directing her dense killing intense at Nozomu, and the earlier unannounced shot was also aimed at his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was confused and holding up his sword, suddenly Shino's presence faded away and her figure blurred again. Immediately afterward, a powerful killing intent is released from the left side of the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-156"></a>"Crap." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively raises his qi, applies physical reinforcement, and raises his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, there was an ear-piercing crash of metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu miraculously prevents Shino's slash, but she continues to unleash a barrage of blows in rapid succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right cleave, left cleave, right slash up, left slash up. A storm of extremely precise slashes is launched with fluid and lean movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps Shino is also strengthening her body, and the storm of slashes gives Nozomu's arm an impact that is hard to believe was released from the old woman's slender arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu intercepted the deadly sword, retreating little by little to escape the pressure of the slashes that came in succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  interlocks  his  knees,  hips,  arms,  and  all  of  his  body  without  wasting  time  to  catch  his master's sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  Nozomu  was  still  overwhelmed.  Although  they  are  both  users  of  the  same technique  of  swordsmanship,  Shino  is  superior  in  terms  of  skill,  physical  ability,  and experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaagh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was hit by a strong hit, and he was unable to resist and broke away with his flash step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shino also immediately activated her flash step. She caught up Nozomu, who quickly broke away and gave chase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One, two, three blows are delivered to each other as they move at high speeds, clashing their sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As twilight faded and darkness began to envelop the surroundings, only the trails of the swords, illuminated by the full moon, reflected their presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha...ha...ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Phew!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their movements, which had been linear, had somehow changed to curving, wrapping around each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu "Flash step-Curved Style" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A development of the qijutsu "flash step". It is an extremely difficult technique that requires a good  sense  of  balance  to  completely  control  the  momentum  of  the  flash  step  and  delicate physical manipulation to link all the body movements without waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-157"></a>The technique enables the user which can only move in a straight line, to move in complex curves, but because it changes the direction of movement while moving at high speed, if it loses its balance, it will slam into the ground with great force and cause serious injury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shino use such advanced techniques without difficulty and continue to collide with each other while drawing spirals in the darkness of the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shino was also the better user of flash step-curved style As with flah step and goes curved, the speed of movement is still proportional to the ability of the person using it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  it  was  only  natural  that  Shino's  flash  step-curved  style  were  superior  to  those  of Nozomu, who was under the suppression of his abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gradually falling behind, they were finally stopped in their tracks by Shino, who was ahead of them on the move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, Nozomu was forced into a situation where he and Shino stopped to strike each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino also removes the scabbard from her waist and holds it in her left hand, becoming a two-sword wielder and attacking Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crap!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aiming for an opening to deal with the next slash, Shino swings her left-hand sheath through the air, aiming for the torso. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu backs up and avoid to the side cleave. The sheath had been strenghtened with qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's  swordsmanship  emphasizes  actual  combat.  It  is  a  comprehensive  fighting  technique that incorporates not only swordsmanship, but also sheath and body techniques. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases, they use whatever is available, whether it is a rock or a branch that has fallen around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the sheath, strengthened by qijutsu, can easily snap a person's bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, who now wields both sword and scabbard, is able to attack more intensely than before, although each blow is less powerful, and the sword and scabbard she wields are like the jaws of a wolf, closing in to bite Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also reflexively removes his scabbard from the sword belt at his waist and changes to a two-sword style with the scabbard. He handles the stormy of his master's attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, they are still being pushed around due to the difference in their original abilities and skills. And the interception by the two swords was not enough, and the blow by the scabbard caught Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-158"></a>"Guuhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dull thud, Shino's scabbard catches Nozomu's left arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively tried to limit the damage as much as possible by focusing his attention on the point of impact, but the impact of Shino's blow was so tremendous that his left arm became numb and useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not missing an opportunity to take advantage of Nozomu's sluggish movement, Shino flashes his right-hand sword into a horizontal cleave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intercepting  with  a  sword  is  not  possible in  time.  Nozomu  was  forced  to  turn  his  body  and somehow managed to avoid the slash, but this time Shino's kick flew at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu decides he can't avoid it and leaps backwards, attempting to kill the force of her kick, even if only slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gosh ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A jolt to the abdomen that turns his internal organs upside down, combined with the fact that he had originally jumped backward, causes Nozomu's body to be blown wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation is like a rehash of the first bout. But in fact, it is not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Nozomu volunteered to be sent away. Therefore, he was quick to move on to the next action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gliding along the ground, he cracks the whip on his aching arm and sheathes his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment his back is slammed to the ground, he takes a passive stance and sends his qi to the sword as he leaps backward, leaping backward and sending his qi to the sword for extreme compression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-hearted techniques would not work on Shino. Although the number of times he could use it was limited due to the amount of energy he had, Nozomu put his hope in his most reliable technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kijutsu/phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  extremely  compressed  qii  sword  fly  at  high  speed.  Before  you  can  blink,  it  lands  on Shino,......, as it should. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"what the...!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, reality went above Nozomu's expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment Nozomu released his phantom, there was a bursting sound like burning coals popping at the exact midpoint between him and Shino. The extremely compressed qi diffused and dispersed into the surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-159"></a>Upon closer inspection, he saw that before he knew it, Shino was swinging her sword in the same stance of the Battoujutsu (sword drawing technique) as Nozomu. She easily intercepted Nozomu's phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was stunned by the unbelievable situation. There was no way she could have missed such an opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"shi......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino  rushes  in  with  a  blink  of  an  eye.  Nozomu  hurriedly  tries  to  pull  back  his  sword,  but clearly doesn't make it in time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the sword, imbued with qi, took the opposite trajectory from the earlier unannounced strike and slashed through Nozomu's body in an overhanded manner. Fresh blood gushed from the wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ...... Gu!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu kneels on the ground, unable to get strength in his legs due to so much pain and the loss of blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Shino did was quite simple. He canceled out Nozomu's phantom power with the same phantom power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was an extraordinary feat that would not have been out of the ordinary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Phantom is a qi-jutsu that is extremely difficult to see because it compresses qi so thin that it is almost a hair long and also flies at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to intercept with the same Genmoku, the qi-sword must be released precisely, without any deviation, on the same trajectory as the phantom released by Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was able to do something far more difficult than threading such a needle without difficulty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  difference  in  ability  between  Nozomu  and  Shino  was  obvious.  Skill,  ability,  and experience.  She  was  superior  in  every  way,  and  there  was  not  a  single  element  in  which Nozomu could win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can't win, you know it, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stuck in these thoughts, Nozomu's master's words rang in his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, release your suppression." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At those words, Nozomu forgot the pain in his chest and said, "What?" He let out a stunned voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know what I mean. The only way to beat me is to release the suppression." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While holding a wound in his chest that was causing him intense pain, Nozomu agreed with his master's words, his thoughts dulled by the pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-160"></a>'Indeed, it is the only way to win. i immediately understood that it was the only possibility I had.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">'At the same time, however, i had that dream in my mind. Tiamat in the bottom of the lake and the strong anxiety I felt at that time. In my dream, I saw the chained eyes of the Dragon King, with it firm will and gut-wrenching vindictiveness.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is this a characteristic of the spirit species? Perhaps the body dies, but the soul remains intact and survives in nozomu soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And doesn't the suppression of his abilities coincidentally suppress that dragon soul as well as it power? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looks down at his own body, stained with his own blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'If I strained my eyes, I could see the invisible chains wrapped around the bright red body. My body remembers well the feeling of tearing off this chain.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was confident that even if his arm had lost its strength due to blood loss, he would somehow be able to break it apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, ha, ha. ..............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  Nozomu's  hand did  not  move. He could  only  continue to  stare at  his bloodstained arm, unable to make a decision while breathing roughly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only way to win over a serious fight with his master is to tear this chain to shreds. But if doing so it will free Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you still lost it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino again slashes at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, on his knees, raises his sword, somehow preventing only a direct slash, but she takes the opportunity to begin mercilessly striking Nozomu with blows and kicks from her scabbard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guh, ha,... ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  intense  pain  throughout  his  body,  combined  with  the  unstoppable  bleeding,  rapidly whittled away Nozomu's consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'My vision becomes blurry and my hearing becomes distant. The sensation in my limbs fades, as if I have fallen into a cold sea.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Here, will I die?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it is because the other side is Shino. The strong survival instinct that had overflowed in Nozomu's mind during the battle with Tiamat did not well up, and a sense of resignation began to spread, as if to say, "If it's Shishou, then it fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, in Nozomu's rubbing vision, Shino's face appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-161"></a>Her vision was narrowed by blood loss, and although he could not see clearly, his master's face appeared to him to be contorted in anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as if she were repenting, as if she was stifling her regrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why do you look like that?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">'When such a question popped into my head, with a face that looked as if she was about to cry, she told me.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, I am dying. I don't have much time left." </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'm sorry) </p>
<p class="calibre1">but Shino launches an attack on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I'm sorry for doing this out of the blue. I'm sorry for hurting you like this. But this is the last time, and it's my last selfishness.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">The concern that remained in her mind as death was imminent due to sleeping sickness. She was worried that her disciple, who had become a dragon slayer, would be crushed by his own power. In order to remove this concern, it was necessary for her disciple to release his power once, with his own volition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'It was necessary for my disciple himself to face the power of the giant dragon that he had taken in.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, although Shino was able to impart her skills to her disciple, he was unable to train his mind due to his own escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The time she has left is short, and she can no longer fully restore her weakened disciple's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cursing her own foolishness in not having been taught how to train her mind as a master, and her  clumsiness  in  being  able  to  formulate  her  feelings  only  with  a  sword,  Shino  wields  her power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Even if I cannot save him, I hope that I can at least leave a "light and a fire" that can be a guide for my lost and beloved disciple.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then her eyes suddenly caught the expression of child with no concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes did not have the intense will to "live" that he had when he defeated the Dragon King, but rather he looked like an enlightened old man who had accepted the death that was to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of Nozomu's expression, Shino spilled a tear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'No, it's not it! I don't want you to look me in the eye like that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had something to say. I had a thought that I wanted to be accepted.' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-162"></a>However, the sincere wishes are not conveyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm at ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I bite my back teeth so hard I think they will shatter, and push out my scraping voice.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, I am dying. I don't have much time left." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The disciple in front of me opened his eyes wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">At these words, Nozomu's thoughts stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgetting the pain of the laceration running through his chest and the dull ache that should have been echoing throughout his body, he simply stared up at the face of his teacher, who had spoken these unexpected words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Dying? Who? Why?' As if to answer Nozomu's question, Shino opens his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a sleeping sickness. It is a disease that gradually drains the body of its vital energy, and in the end, the body runs out of energy and dies." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu knows about sleeping sickness itself. As a person who deals with qi, he must keep this in his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps the fight against Tiamat opened a hole in my body. Maybe one more night is all I have." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Excessive use of qi, which is believed to be the cause of sleeping sickness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he were a young man, full of life and vitality, he would have been a great success, but Shino has already reached the age of old age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it is an area where skill is required, such as chi control, the fundamental vitality of the body itself is declining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he had controlled his chi a little better, he might still be somewhat alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why don't you! Maybe if we had a little time we could do something about it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shishou!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring Nozomu's frantic voice, Shino proceeds with her story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was furious with his master, who refused to listen to him, but the next words out of her mouth completely silenced him as she raised her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I came here because my family betrayed me. ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, .......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My  own  sister  set  me  up,  my  parents  abandoned  me,  people  insult  me,  so  I  fled  to  this continent." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-163"></a>Then Shino told him a personal story about her that Nozomu had never heard before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu could not hide his astonishment at the story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier, when Shino was talking about her family, she didn't even bother to mention that such a serious thing had happened to her. She was just happy to talk about her family and said she loved them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me and you are remarkably similar. Betrayed by people we care, insult by others, we fled." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's words fell smoothly and naturally into Nozomu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu fled to training to turn away from the reality of being dumped by Lisa, and she actually fled the country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't want to see anyone anymore. I was fine with dying alone. That's why I fled here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino just quietly reveals her thoughts to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu listened silently to her quiet confession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have nothing left. I have spent many years in this forest in vain. Then I met you. At first I was annoyed because I felt like I saw my ownself, but you, unlike me, did not give up on life in the end. I felt something in you that I did not feel in myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cutting off his words, Shino draws his sword and quietly steps back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, this is my last selfishness. ............ I, who have been running away, have one last thing to say. I have something to tell you because it's you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said this and pleaded with Nozomu with a tearful look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please, my last wish. Will you accept it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu wakes up at Shino's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had long since decided on her own path, with her own end in sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is easy to put words in her mouth here and convince her to live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But isn't that twisting her will? She said she had something she wanted to tell me even if it meant cutting her last hours short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... I'll admit it, I've been on the run my whole life. From everything that surrounded me at that school) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Running away, running away, and running away from the fact that you already ran away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(but ............) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gazes straight into her master's face from the front. Her eyes were almost brimming with tears, as if she were lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-164"></a>Nozomu puts his hand on the chains that bind him. He is convinced that if he releases his ability suppression, he will be devoured by the jet-black dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(If I run away from Shishou wish here, I will never be able to face her again. Above all, I don't want Shishou to look at me like that!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  puts  all  his  strength  into  his  arms,  and  with  all  his  might,  he  rips  off  the  invisible chains that bind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A ring of shattered chains danced in the air and disappeared as a residue of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this time, Nozomu finally released his true self with determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the next moment, his consciousness went dark and disappeared into the pitch blackness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu found himself standing by the lakeside where he had dreamed. In front of his eyes, a huge black figure, which should have been at the bottom of the lake, was glaring at him with eyes of hair-raising hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat, the dragon king of destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a vindictive roar, Tiamat raises it paw and attempts to trample the diminutive human who has trapped the dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly jumped backward to avoid the swinging paw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was able to get down on the ground and get past the shockwave that was scattered with a roar, but soon after, the tail of the dragon who had been reared sideways was right in front of him, scraping the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to duck, the huge tail strikes directly and blasts Nozomu's body like a pebble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaahhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  thrown  into  the  air,  knocked  unconscious  by  the  intense  pain,  and  as  far  as  he  was concerned, hit the ground without even being able to catch himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shock brings him back to consciousness, but he cannot feel anything, as if his entire body's sense of pain has been paralyzed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  closer  inspection,  the  right  side  of  the  body  was  covered  in  blood,  broken  bones  had broken through the body, and the body looked like a sea urchin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a single blow, Nozomu's body became completely dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  his  entire  body  paralyzed,  he  somehow  manages  to  stand  up,  straining  his  trembling muscles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat opens it huge palate and creates a chaos-tainted flame in front of Nozomu, who stands before him with a rag-like body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-165"></a>Unlike when they met by chance in the sealed world, this time the giant dragon had  come to kill Nozomu from the beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a yell of joy, Nozomu lunges toward Tiamat! </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Considering the difference in ability between that Dragon and myself, i  can't take the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't have time to deal with you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Nozomu had no eye on Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge breath is released from the mouth of the giant dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the blink of an eye, Nozomu tried to duck by twisting himself in front of the huge flame, but there  was  no  way  he  could  avoid  it  with  his  battered  body,  and  the  right  half  of  his  body disappeared when it came into contact with the flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, he leapt with his left foot. With the sound of the explosion and shockwave echoing behind him, he plunged into tiamat, but  at  the end of his leap, he found the open mouth of a  giant dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu jumps in and instantly his mouth closes, and fangs reminiscent of great swords of steel tear his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lower half of his body is severed and half his head is gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's entire body was pierced by Tiamat fangs, and his body was reduced to a bloody mass of flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, perhaps because he was in the spiritual world, even though he was injured and should have been dead, Nozomu's consciousness, like that of a mantis, was still connected to the world, albeit fleeting and fragile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His whole body was smashed up, and the vision was stained blood red. In the depths of his vision, he saw a small light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A small but extremely powerful ball of light, colored black, red, blue, green, and yellow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment Nozomu saw the photosphere, he had a gut feeling. This was the power of Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He reach out to touch the light. The lower half of his body is already lost and his internal organs are dripping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His right arm is missing, and his left arm is gouged out and half shredded by his fangs. His consciousness is dazed, and his mouth is only full of blood, and he can only moan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, he reaches out his hand. When his battered hand touched the light, the light spilled out and Nozomu's vision went dark again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-166"></a>† </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the light subsided, Nozomu's consciousness returned to the garden of Shino's hut from the black lakeside where he had confronted Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuooooooo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Power overflows from his entire body. The force is so great that it scrapes away at Nozomu's soul and body as if it were using a rough file. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his soul and body being whittled away, Nozomu realized that time was running out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'The power of Tiamat, which is so mighty, cannot be drawn out for a long time. If prolonged, I will be consumed by this power and die, or worse, my body will be torn apart and Tiamat will be resurrected.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, his master's face breaks into a happy smile as she looks at her disciple, who has removed his own fetters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu readies his sword once more. Blood was still flowing from the wound on his chest where he had been cut, but he didn't care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I will accept everything she has to wish.' With this determination, Nozomu once again faced his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm coming!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come, you idiot disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Releasing more qi than ever before, Shino also readies her sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Zeeeyaaaa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shino again invoke their flash step-curved style drawing intricate curves in the dark night, and their sword flashes begin to sparkle in the moonlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sparks from the clashing swords popped like stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their speed had reached a realm where even the best warriors could no longer follow them with their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene of the two sides striking each other in an entwining manner was no different from the previous one. However, their superiority was clearly different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blow that Nozomu unleashes paralyzes Shino's arm, and her slash is conversely blocked and repelled by Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Shino had the advantage in terms of skill, he clearly outperformed her in the abilities he had freed by releasing his ability supression and in the power he had gained by becoming a dragon slayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino is gradually being outnumbered. She complains unintentionally. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-167"></a>"Guhh, why don't you be a little nicer to maiden, you stupid disciple!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about, at least there are no frail maiden i have to be nice to in front of me! For goodness sake, think of your age and your competence!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A maiden is a maiden no matter how old she is! You don't know the heart of a woman, and that's why your lover abandon you, you lunkhead!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? I don't need to be told by a hermit hiding deep in the forest like this! If you're a slacker, you're probably a slacker, too, you naive little shit!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a insolent! How dare you speak like that to your master! Get back there! They're going to knock your guts out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Great! I've had enough of your tantrums for one day! You put a qi jutsu to me just for a joke! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you know how many times I've almost died!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I took it easy on you so you wouldn't die! Luckly, just barely enough to make you back!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not the point! Why should I die just for a lucky break!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry about every little detail! It's all right that you're back!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not good!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They clashed swords with each other as they talked nonsense to each other. An exchange of extremely sophisticated techniques and an extremely trivial war of tongues were going on at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's go!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's expression is distorted in frustration as her full-body sword technique is rebuffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih, we can't end this if we don't do this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, you just said end! You're killing me, you old hag!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course not, I said so at the beginning! You will be sorry in hell for the crime of gouging out the heart of a maiden!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino  compresses  her  qi  with  both  hands  on  her  hips.  When  she  thrust  her  hands  out,  the compressed chi was released forward at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi jutsu/shockwave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a qijutsu in which compressed qi is released in one direction to blow away the opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino gives chase to Nozomu, who is blown away by the wave cannon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Screw you, enemy of the maidens!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dusky tone far from that of a maiden, Shino unleashes a move she has been preparing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kijutsu/phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-168"></a>Extremely  compressed  qi  was  released  toward  Nozomu,  but  he  was  already  in  position  to intercept it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's my line, old hag! Age fraud and violence are crimes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same qijutsu, Phantom, is released. Their techniques collide in the middle of each other and cancel each other out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is extreme concentration that enabled Nozomu to offset phantom  with phantom, as Shino did earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment, Nozomu was beginning to grow rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I had the background to begin with. I was able to learn Shishou swordsmanship in less than two years, and I overcame the hellish training she gave me, for whatever reason.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino and Tiamat. Fighting against the absolute strongmen, who are rarely fought even in this world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, "breaking his own chains with his own volition" had promoted his rapid growth, and his skills had evolved to the same level as Shino's at one stroke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  of  them  once  again  create  an  extreme  qi-sword  on  their  own  swords  while  cutting through the residue of qi scattered all around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Remember the greatness of your Master!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're just a natural criminal!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The qijutsu phantom is released again in the time it takes for the sword to reach the target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The returning swords, charged with extremely compressed qi, collide with each other, causing qi and sparks to bloom again in the surrounding area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shino connect the next technique further amidst the dancing sparks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body is rotated using the momentum of the returning sword. While delivering the sword, sheathe butt toward the opponent and strike him at the same time as delivering the sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu, Yabu fu uchi (Core Piercing). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  an internal  destruction technique in  which the qi  and shockwave  are simultaneously launched into the opponent's body, destroying his or her internal organs. If it is taken seriously, it is an extremely lethal qi-jutsu, which can disintegrate the internal organs of an opponent, no matter what kind of hard armor he is clad in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boom! The two are slightly separated from each other by a shockwave that resonates in their stomachs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling the recoil of their own technique canceled out in their hands, the two turn themselves around and send qi into the hand that is not holding the sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The amount of qi contained an enormous amount of qi, unmatched by any qijutsu before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-169"></a>They slam their fists, which are fed with a large amount of qi, into each other's ground. Then the ground between them exploded and a pillar of light erupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi jutsu, Annilihation Light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A qi-jutsu in which qi launched into the ground is released at the feet of the enemy, launching it into the air and destroying it with a torrent of light from the qi release. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The qijutsu, which boasts the greatest range of effect and high annihilation power among the techniques they possess, crashed through the ground. As it was, it was pushed out to the ground like lava spewing from a volcano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not done yet!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Either mine!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even after they had finished releasing their qijutsu, which could be called extreme, the two did not stop. Both of them rush into their opponents with their swords still in the retracted state, using all four of their limbs to engage in combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using his fists, legs, elbows, and every other part of his body, he strikes his opponent as if he were dancing. Their forms are like mirror images of each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, strange changes began to appear around the two men as they released their fist blows as if dancing. Particles of light began to soar, spiraling and gathering around Nozomu and Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  light  particles  are  fragments  of  magic  power,  called  magical  elements,  floating  in  the surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ritual body-art, Rin'ne Kaiten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  a  magic  called  ritual  magic.  As  the  name  suggests,  it  is  magic  that  is  activated  by interfering with the magical elements of the outside world through rituals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Caskell  Matiato  said  in  his  magic  class,  ritual  magic  has  its  origins  in  the  ritual  art  of offering prayers and offerings to the gods and spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the rituals, dances were also dedicated, as were prayers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ritual body art was created by taking advantage of this and fusing "dance" and "martial arts". </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  attacking  an  opponent  with  a  certain  type,  he  dedicates  it  as  a  "dance,"  establishes  a ritual, and interferes with the surrounding magical elements. He then deploys the ritual magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  "Rin'ne  Kaiten"  absorbs  the  surrounding  magical  elements  and  applies  physical enhancements over and over again, and the more it dances, the more powerful it becomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  most  astonishing  of  all  is  the  combination  of  qijutsu  and  magic,  two  techniques  that normally repulsive techniques. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ability to control magic depends on the mind of the surgeon and his or her technique. And the ritual body-art is, in other words, the dance itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-170"></a>Nozomu originally lacked a background in magic and would never have been able to use qijutsu and magic together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the synergistic effect of the outstanding control of qi and the control of magic by the stable spirit and perfect dance makes it possible for the two to combine magic and qi techniques at this very moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the clash between the two, with their bodies strengthened by magic over and over again, eventually intensified to the point that the shockwaves shook the surrounding trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dance continued uninterrupted, and the light of the magical elements gathered around them as if to praise the dance. Dazzling magical power gathered around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to the dazzling magical light, Shino's vision rapidly lost its color and light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ah, this is nearing its end. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to compete with Nozomu, who had become exceptionally strong, Shino also had to use all of himself and the skills he had accumulated to push the limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, somehow even is the best they can do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  loss  of  qi  beyond  the  limit  has  caused  the  sleeping  sickness  to  progress  quickly.  The amount  of  qi  recovered  and  the  amount  of  qi  lost  were  reversed  and  would  be  completely depleted in just a few more hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Well, ............ it's okay for me) </p>
<p class="calibre1">She gazes  at  her last  disciple thinking as if he  were  a stranger, that her time had only been somewhat hastened before her death was confirmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(He really has become strong. There are probably only a few people on the continent who can beat him now when he has released his restraint) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino  was  truly  pleased  with  Nozomu's  growth,  as  even  those  men  could  be  overthrown  in some cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More than that, 'the fact that he was willing to face the power of that giant dragon for this old woman's last request struck me. A force so powerful that it could easily crush a small human being.  Ordinarily,  terrific  power  like  this  would  have  made  me  go  insane  with  fear.  Yet,  i pushed aside my fear and moved forward.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This will be the last one but thanks to ....... Nozomu) </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had lost everything and was empty. Thinking of her beloved disciple, she stepped into the last moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dance finally came to an end. Nozomu and Shino's kicks, strengthened to the limit, collide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-171"></a>The surrounding ground is wound up and blown away by the shockwave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trees were creaking and shrieking loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reusing the impact of the collision, the two rotate their bodies like a vajra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sees Shino, who is holding a sword at her waist, just like himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is drenched in beads of sweat and her face is bloodless, releasing an enormous amount of qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It definitely indicated the master's final blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shi......sho" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu grits his teeth and endures the force that threatens to make him explode. He can't hold on much longer. His rationality was being eroded, and his body was rattled by the excessive force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the final blow, Nozomu's mind flashed back to the time when he first met her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'A chance encounter in the forest and hellish training. For confronting me with facts that I had turned a blind eye to, and for inspiring me to overcome it. And that she said, "Welcome back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where she was was definitely "a place to return" for Nozomu. That will disappear soon. This fact is very sad and my heart is almost bursting with pain.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there is no turning back. Then, not wanting to be seen in a state of disrepair, Nozomu leaves the sadness behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(at least for the last time, thank you very much. Shishou ......) He opens his qi to its fullest and steps forward with his sword and his whole body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, qi is concentrated on the stepped leg to strengthen the pole. The muscles that move from the foot to the knees, hips, and shoulders are linked without any deviations in the pole-strengthening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a technique of simply releasing a sword with an extreme qi-sword attached at your fastest speed. It is simply a sword that contains all of your thoughts and feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu, Maboroshi-flash (Phantom-flash). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A brief flash of light glimmers in the moonlit garden, swords crossed. A sound similar to a cool bell echoes, and silence returns again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shino stand like statues with their swords drawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's sword had only the hilt left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the two swords collided. His sword was shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino's slash was also completely out-competed by Nozomu's single sword, and her sword was blown far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, Shino's body collapsed on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-172"></a>"Shishou!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rushes to Shino and holds her in his arms. Her face, which had turned pale, was now completely white, and her body was as cold as if she were holding ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu,  you  are  getting  stronger.  It  seems  there's  nothing  i  can  teach  you  with  a  sword anymore. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shishou......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With lips that can no longer do anything but tremble, Shino spins her last words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that she was going to die here was a powerful reality that pierced Nozomu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if remembering, Nozomu's eyes become hot and she is unable to hold back her tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I  was  happy.  I  was  happy  that  he  accepted  my  last  wish.  ............  took  my  feelings  into consideration.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's face contorted in sorrow and her eyes filled with tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncontrollable tears trickle down her cheeks and drip onto Shino's pale face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino smiled gently at the feel of hot tears falling on her cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, please....remember this. You can keep running away. You can keep standing away </p>
<p class="calibre1">. But don't look away from the fact that you ranning away and the reality that you are standing away. If you forget that, you will be trapped like me, and you will not be able to really mowing forward." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She may no longer be able to see. Her gaze swims in the air, and her scruffy voice is gradually becoming muffled and inaudible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if you run away, even if you stop, if you don't forget that, you will move forward one day, in whatever form that may take. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu said, "Yes, Shishou." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino let out a relieved breath when he heard Nozomu's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last life she had left was fading away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good, I'm happy now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino looks up at the moon. Caught by her, Nozomu also looks up at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was quiet, watchful, and filled with a gentle light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, I'm little tired, I'm going to ...... sleep a little. I'll see you at ............ sometime again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... yes Shishou. Good night." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Satisfied, she slowly closed her eyes and fell into a deep, deep sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Into a deep sleep that will never awaken again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All that remained was someone's voice, stifled and sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-173"></a>† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning, Nozomu buried Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A grave is erected next to the hut where she spent many years and flowers are added. At his waist is Shino's sword, which has become a memento. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of his master's grave, Nozomu thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'She said now i'm still standing away in my own mind. About Lisa, about the school. About myself. I might run away again. I might remain standing still. But I decided to end my efforts to turn away from the fact of escape itself.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his master's teachings, his sword, and the budding of a new determination, Nozomu sets out with his master's grave at his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dark night was over and the rising sun was illuminating his way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
