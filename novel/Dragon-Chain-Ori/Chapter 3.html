<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; An Aching Old Wounds</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been given special training by Shino from early morning, managed to finish the morning class with exhaustion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh ... the sun looks so dazzling" </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling of fatigue that covers my whole body is usual, but today the sun looked even more hazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dumb head, Nozomu leaves the school building once to buy lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Solminati Academy is built in the center of Arcazam, but there is a large park surrounding it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This central park is a place of relaxation for the people of the city and for the students, and there are many stalls selling light meals around the park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  struggling  student,  Nozomu  is  basically  a  self-catering  person,  but  today,  when  he  was required to work out twice as much as usual in the morning, he did not have the energy to prepare lunch early in the morning after returning to the dormitory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be honest, I don't want to go to Central Park, where there are many students from the school but other places in the school building are much more crowded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, now it’s lunchtime. Not only students but also the general public of the city visit the central park for lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of Nozomu's eyes, people with a wide variety of appearances, such as those with animal-like tails and ears and those with bird-like wings, were peering into stalls or lying down on the grass in the park, spending their time as they pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The continent of Arkmill was originally inhabited by a wide variety of ethnic groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are a variety of races, from fairy species such as elves and carbuncles to subraces including beastmen and other rare species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arcazam was built by gathering human resources from all over the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason, the Central Park, where so many people gather, is truly a melting pot of races. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew it, there were a lot of people. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hustle  and  bustle  of  a  large  gathering  of  people  may  be  an  exciting  sight  for  some,  but unfortunately, Nozomu is a bit uncomfortable with strangers, partly because he is despised at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fed up with the hustle and bustle condition, I bought some bread at a deserted stall and walked into a nearby forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  central  park  is  quite  large,  but  is  basically  an  open  lawn  around  the  perimeter,  with  trees growing thicker as one moves inward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And since most people spend their time in the lawn area with desks and chairs, the forest is filled with an air of tranquility, unlike the noisy lawn area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For now, Nozomu walked through a wooded area with many trees and sat down at the base of a suitable tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He puts his mouth on a loaf of bread purchased from a street vendor and chews and swallows the crumbly dough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, it was a bit hard, and I can't say it tasted very good. Well, it's cheap, so it's okay. ...... hmm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After taking a bite, Nozomu, who had a subtle expression on his face at the tastelessness of the food, tilted his head at the strange sight that suddenly caught his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"who is in a place like this…..? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A girl is looking up at a tree and cringing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A girl of about ten years old, with glossy black hair neatly trimmed around her shoulders, she has a strangely eye-catching air about her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(just my feelings, she looks a lot like someone I saw recently: ...... Emm, Ah. Can't get my head around it) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl's appearance stuck in Nozomu's mind, cause the master's intense early morning training and due to hunger had caused Nozomu's head to go on full strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At noon, the central park is crowded with people, but unfortunately, Nozomu and the girl are in the woods, where it is not popular place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, it is hard to imagine any other human being noticing a girl in trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Beside, That uniforms belong to Ecross students, doesn’t it ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, the girl was wearing a white uniform, much like Nozomu's uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ecross is an affiliated school attached to the Solminati Academy and attended mainly by young children around the age of ten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  school's  founding  purpose  is  to  develop  highly  capable  individuals  by  providing  gifted education to promising children from an early age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chosen ones are the legitimate children of the leading figures of each country or those born with rare talents and abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(She's a little small for someone who attends Ecross. Well, if she's a student at that school, she could be in this place. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl in front of Nozomu was rather small for a student of Ecross, but as long as she was wearing that uniform, there seemed no doubt that she was a student of that school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(She seems to be in some kind of trouble, and i can't leave her alone. ......) Usually, Nozomu does not like to get involved with strangers, but he cannot leave a young girl in such an unpopular place who is clearly looks in trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, for the time being, get rid of the doubts and feelings of avoidance of strangers from his mind and decided to boldly talk to the girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's voice was drawn out from nervousness, and the girl turned around vigorously. The girl's deep jet-black eyes looked up at Nozomu. The color of her eyes,  which seemed to absorb him, gave Nozomu a strong sense of déjà vu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are a student of Ecross, right? What are you doing here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, actually, I was playing with Kuro-chan during my lunch break. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Kuro-chan?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl looked up at the tree in front of her. As if prompted by the girl, Nozomu also looked up and saw a black cat relaxing on a branch, playing with something in the shape of a ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's that? An Ornament?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry," she said. "It's my arm ornament, but Kuro-chan liked it so much that he took it from me at ....... Ah, Kuro-chan, give it back to me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl looks troubled and pleads with the black cat on the tree, but the black cat, called "Kuro-chan," seems to like her arm ornament so much that it does not pay attention to the girl's voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It's a pretty tall tree. furhermore, the skin of the tree is slippery. Even an adult would have a hard time climbing it.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... no choice then." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rolls up the sleeves of his uniform, puts his hands on the trunk of the tree, and begins to climb it with ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  forest,  he  often  climbed  trees  to  escape  from  Demonic  beasts,  so  tree  climbing  was something he was adept at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the black cat notices Nozomu climbing up the tree and raises its tail in alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give up already and give back the ornament." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu climbed up to the height of the black cat and reached out to grab it, but the black cat in question  said,  "Fusha  ----!"  The  animal  growled  and  snarled  at  Nozomu,  threatening  him,  and swung its claws at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, don't get violent!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hugya!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu tried to touch his body, the black cat bared its fangs and finally pounced on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as Nozomu is concerned, he can't move much on the tree, and the black cat sticks to his face and scratches him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ouch, you fucking cat!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he meets more resistance than expected, Nozomu grabs the back of the black cat's neck with one hand and forcibly pulls it away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black cat, on the other hand, was not to be outdone. Raising its claws, it dexterously scratches the back of Nozomu's hand, which is in its grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go ahead!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the pain of the run weakened Nozomu's grip, the black cat softly twisted and turned his body to break free from the restraints and leapt on...... using Nozomu's hand as a foothold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back on the branch, the black cat said, 'This is mine! He puts his chest out through his neck to the arm ornament as if to assert that he is the one who is in charge of the project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, even Nozomu, who was scratched by the black cat, did not retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that the lunch bread you just purchased has fallen to the ground and is covered in dirt paint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was tasteless and not tasty, but it was still a valuable source of energy for Nozomu, who was a struggling student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who has become stubborn after his precious lunch was ruined, once again reaches for the black cat on the branch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then begins the big fight between Nozomu and the black cat. The black cat jumped on Nozomu and said, "Be quiet! Nozomu grabbed it, and the black cat said, "Let go of me! and scratches and bites with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Onii~chan, Kuro-chan ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the girl looks up at him with concern, the battle between one person and one animal gradually heats up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, the branches of the trees on the battlefield begin to creak and squeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, in  the middle of the brawl, the moment  Nozomu  put  his  hand on a branch  and put his weight on it, the limit was reached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snap! With a "S" sound, a branch snaps, and one person and one animal are thrown into the air, having lost their foothold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow meow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulled by gravity, Nozomu and the cat fall headlong toward the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as might be expected of a cat, the "cat" is not a ordinary cat at all. Despite being suddenly thrown into the air, the black cat quickly flipped itself around and was quickly and easily placed in the girl's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu was unable to regain his stance and crashed awkwardly to the ground on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thump! He hit the back of his head and crouched on the ground with a pathetic moan and groan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um, are you okay ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ yeah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu somehow manages to stand up, holding back the tears oozing from the depths of his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had mixed feelings of pity and embarrassment at the worried look in the girl's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But more importantly, are your ornament okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu asked about the armlet, which was his goal, he peeked at the black cat tucked into the girl's arm. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/dGJX0fh/000009.jpg" alt="000009" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">The  black  cat  was  in  the  girl's  arms,  jostling  against  the  ornament  around  her  neck,  but  the ornament itself was not broken and seemed fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad. Thank you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl smiles with gorgeous smile, sincerely relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mouth naturally loosens at the sight of his innocent and pure smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't introduce myself. My name is Somiliana. My friends call me Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm Nozom Bountis. Nozomu is fine. Somia-chan, you can call me ......, I guess?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! Nice to meet you, Nozomu-san!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, ......, it's nice to meet you too." </p>


<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was being pushed around by the strangely excited black-haired girl, but the tension she felt when she approached him had completely faded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was scratched and fell from a tree, and it hurt quite a bit, but the sight of the girl with a big smile on her face made the pain in my body go away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking back, I have rarely been thanked by anyone, except for yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who never smiles or has a smile directed at him in his normal school life, found himself smiling sincerely for the first time in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clang, clang, clang. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a bell rang out in the woods, signaling the end of the lunch break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Ah" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Somia. They both let out a distracted sound as if to indicate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I can't. I have to get back to class!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the sound of the first bell of the school day, Somia began to panic. Even though the Ecross school building is attached to the Solminati Academy, it would take longer for the girl's feet to get there than for Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'd better get there soon. It's bad to be late." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! Um, thank you again!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia bowed deeply once more, and with the cat in her small arms, ta-ta! And with nimble steps, he headed back toward the school building to Ecross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu exhales with satisfaction as she looks behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I missed lunch, but ......, oh well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Nozomu did for her was not much. They just had a fight with a naughty cat and fell out of a tree together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, the words of appreciation from others brought a sense of fulfillment to Nozomu that made him forget his hunger for a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-68"></a>† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu returned to the academy with a sense of fulfillment for the first time in a long time, but in the afternoon he had to attend Caskell's one-sided class again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, this time it was a practical class on ritual magic, a class that Nozomu, who cannot use magic at all, is really not good at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  had  no  choice  but  to  sit  at  the  edge  of  the  training  area  where  he  was  observing  his classmates' practical training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I mentioned in the previous lesson, ritual magic is one of the most classic forms of magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  if  you  follow  the  procedure  properly,  unless  you  are  very  talented,  you  can  invoke magic of a lower level. Unless you are very talented. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Caskell glances over to Nozomu, who is sitting at the edge of the training area, several of his classmates begin to giggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm teaching my class now, you scrappy stoners. How many times have I told you that your lowly brains, don't understand me? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu frowned at the mockery directed at him, his homeroom teacher, Caskell, let out an exasperated squeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, you know, that ...... hit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell grabbed one of the girls who was laughing at Nozomu by the chin and looked down at her with an intimidating stare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care about you smoldering at the bottom of the pile. If you're not going to do it, get out of here. Oh, you want me to expel you? Then say so. I'll have them do it right away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, it's not that. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why did you interrupt my class? Can't you even understand how your own actions will come back to you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girls are completely consumed by the cascade of giggling eyes peering in at them and tears in their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girls' eyes wandered about as if looking for help, but the other students all looked away in unison, as if they did not want to be noticed by Caskell now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, however, a resentful voice interrupted the isolated female student and Caskell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said, "Hey Caskell, leave those little fish alone and get on with it. We're running out of time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice was Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glared at both Caskell and the girls with his arms crossed in a sullen manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no sense of protecting and defending a female student who was on the verge of tears at the sight of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was these girls and others who acted to provoke Caskell, who does not like to have his classes interrupted, and they are the ones who are being subjected to this because they completely deserve it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... certainly don't have time for these bunch of trash." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell releases his hand that was holding the girl's chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then resumed the class, ignoring the female students who slumped to the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I mentioned earlier, this class is about ritual magic. I will explain the effects of the magic to be performed, the necessary tools and procedures, and then each of you will practice the magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caskell points to the edge of the training field." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a strange magic circle painted on it, with a wooden altar and a wax candle in the center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's an altar that recreates classic ceremonial magic," he said."Each of you will recreate that altar and use ritual magic on it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, it was a practical training on ritual magic, so they were going to start by actually making an altar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The magic is activated by chanting the celebratory words according to a predetermined procedure while increasing the magic power in the center. Oh, rest assured. The magic that is invoked is only to the extent of lighting a lamp or precipitating water, depending on the practitioner's background." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After listening to the explanation, each person gathers the necessary tools, scatters to the training area, and begins work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The components for building an altar are prearranged in a predetermined shape, and the basics can be simply assembled as they are. The problem is the creation of the magic circle, which is a bit more difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  accuracy  of  the  magic  circle  is  directly  related  to  the  accuracy  of  the  technique.  It  is  also important to match the surgeon's background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  the  students  here  are,  by  all  rights,  those  who  study  at  the  continent's  highest academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They quickly created an altar and a magic circle, and successfully performed ritual magic one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay, we're done. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Phew, is this how it's supposed to be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, look at Mars. He's pretty awesome." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who excelled the most in such a situation was, not surprisingly, Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  the  others  create  winds  just  enough  to  blow  out  the  candles  on  the  altar  and  palm-sized flames, he creates a vortex of wind that envelops the entire altar he has prepared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although his coarse language and behavior may not suggest it, Mars is a rare person who is able to use magic and qi-jutsu at a very high level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The main source of qi and magic power, also known as life force and spiritual power, are all rooted in the power of the soul, which is called the source element, but they do not mix when they are biased toward either the body or the spirit, and they repel each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, people's backgrounds tend to be biased toward either magic or kijutsu, or both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, some of them are exceptional and show a high aptitude for both qi-jutsu and magic, but that percentage is less than 10% of the total. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, when it comes to those who can use magic and kijutsu at the same time, the number is even more drastically reduced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every time I think, Isn't it funny that that guy is in the tenth grade?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,  even  before  he  entered  the  school,  he  seemed  to  be  quite  violent  in  town,  and  after  he entered the school, he was biting people here and there. It's not hard to see why." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, idiot, you're talking too loud. You'll be watched." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The boys who had been whispering to each other stare at Mars and awkwardly move away from each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his golden hair fluttering in the swirling wind, Mars is astonished. With a resentful look on his face, he quickly erased the wind he had created and quickly moved on to the next task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu sat on the edge of the training ground and continued to watch his classmates' </p>
<p class="calibre1">lessons with a blank expression on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one calls out to him, no one cares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has been in this way for almost all of his practical magic classes since his freshman year, not just once or twice, when he was sentenced to a tour that resembled neglect because of his lack of magical power due to ability suppression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have no background. You have no meaning. Don't  get in my way. I have been treated as someone who doesn't exist, being told words like that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now they are only going to class to earn attendance days and not to lose their evaluations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I’m used to it by now, y'all. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">With resignation in his heart, Nozomu turned his attention to the training ground next door, as if to escape from the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next door, another class of the same two grades is teaching a practical class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the practical skills teacher, several assistant teachers were seen in the same training area, as if it were a class of considerably higher rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The content of the class seems to be a one-on-one mock battle, but the classroom setting is clearly different from that of Nozomu and his classmate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Auxiliary teachers prepare potions for students who have completed mock battles and sometimes act as mock opponent themselves, among many other things that are not done in Nozomu's and his classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Solminati Academy provides preferential treatment for each rank in order to foster talented students in a better environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The preferential treatment exists even in everyday classes, and the higher ranks thus have more opportunities for guidance from teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the adventurers' guilds and stores in town can also receive requests, goods, and services that they seek on a priority basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was looking at a class scene different from her own, but her eyes widened involuntarily when her distinctive long black hair suddenly came into view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was in the spasim forest yesterday: ....... "So that was from the first class ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What caught Nozomu's eye was Irisdina Francilt, whom he had met just yesterday in the Spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She steps toward the center of the training field as her homeroom teacher urges her to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing in front of her as her opponent is a female student with crimson hair tied up in a ponytail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened as soon as he saw the person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina's partner was a former lover who had once pledged her future to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's heart pulses loudly at the sight of her, whom he has not seen in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since moving up to the second grade, Nozomu and Lisa had not seen each other at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the meritocratic of Solminati Academy, there is a large separation between each class, and few students visit other classes, even during breaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably, Nozomu's chances of seeing Lisa are also drastically reduced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had not seen her in almost a year, and she looked much more dignified and muscular than she had during the first grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from a distance, you can see her growth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing this, Nozomu felt more pain in his squeaky chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He clenches his fists in an attempt to cover up the pain in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he came to, Nozomu had forgotten all about his classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa and Iris Dina, facing each other in the center of the training ground, hold up their weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina is poised to point the tip of a mock sword that resembles a slender blade, while Lisa sits down,  half-conscious,  with  two  imitation  swords,  long  and  short,  reminiscent  of  sabers  in  her hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's stance is reminiscent of an agile cat, while Irisdina's is graceful, reminiscent of an orchestra conductor. Both are on their toes, keeping their eyes on the other and breathing in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Lisa who moved first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She casts a spell to strengthen his limbs, and at once she steps toward Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Damn, that's fast!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is amazed at her acceleration, which he can follow with his eyes from a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Irisdiina calmly intercepts Lisa despite being shown that much acceleration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five magic bullets created by the "Immediate Deployment" ability are shot at Lisa as she rushes forward at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa also  did  not  slow down at  all, even though her twin  swords were used to  repel  and knock down the five dark-colored magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa, who had closed the gap between the two, reared her right long sword while echoing the spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kiiiiiiin! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris  Dina,  using  the  immediate  deployment  of  her  abilities  to  strengthen  her  own  body,  deftly parries Lisa's powerful cleave, which carries the momentum of the rush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She then spins around to the side of Lisa's body to release the impact she received. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina counterattacked with a body movement reminiscent of a graceful dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A precise thrust with the momentum and body rotation that was passed off, struck Lisa from the rear left side of the vacant Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now Lisa is also one of the best in her grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He slams his left dagger into the belly of the oncoming thin sword, and leaps wide upward of the oncoming stab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gakiiiiin!  A  strong  metallic  sound  echoed,  and  Irisdina's  expression,  which  had  been  watching from a distance, clouded slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Lisa has the edge in body enhancement magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, Lisa's follow-up attack was unleashed on Irisdina, who had exposed a gap by bouncing her gains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the help of twin swords and powerful body-enhancing magic, a swarm of slashing blows, like a storm, hits Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina handles that swarm of slashes with precision while retreating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Can you handle that sword fight? ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">While admiring Irisdina's swordsmanship, the flow of the battle is tilted toward her by Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this rate, no matter how much Irisdina might be pushed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment Nozomu thought of this, something remarkable happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pssst!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, Lisa, who had been on the offensive, interrupts her attack and throws herself back down heavily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately afterwards, a magic bullet ran past her eyes at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see two magic bullets forming around Iris Dina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I don't know how she can build a formula from being attacked like that, just by thinking. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following the earlier shot, the two remaining magic bullets strike Lisa at close range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa raises her twin swords to block the magic bullet that is shot out, but her forward momentum is completely killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The speed which is Iris Dina deployed her technique gave Nozomu chills once again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Lisa cut off from the offensive, Iris Dina is ready to counterattack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She slashes at  Lisa as if dancing with his thin sword, which shimmers and very shimmers, and then shoots out magic bullets as if overlapping the sword fights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also begins to use more varied magic in rapid succession, such as applying enhancement magic to the thin sword he wields to increase the power of his slashes, attempting to ensnare Lisa's legs with black chains, and creating a fog of darkness to block her vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Even though she wields her sword so fiercely, the only magic she can use is magic bullets? ......) Nozomu  was  stunned  when  she  was  once  again  shown  the  height  of  first  place  overall  for  the school year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  Lisa,  too,  continues  to  outmaneuver  the  ever-changing  Iris  Dina's  attackers  and continues to fire without retreating a step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She uses her twin swords to bounce off the magic bullets that come at him from his blind spot, breaking the chains of magic that try to wrap around him and blowing away the fog of darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The twin sword dance that conjures up visions of storms, and the sword demon's continuous strikes that conjure up images of clear streams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of swords slashing together and magic bursting out of them echoed through the training hall like a waterfall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in the midst of a completely even attack, Lisa suddenly leapt backward in a big leap and opened up a gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu wonders why she, who had been fighting an offensive-oriented battle, suddenly took a distance from him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the moment the twin swords Lisa was carrying were stacked on top of each other, an explosion of magical power rose up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flames coiled around the cross-shaped blades and sheaths of the sword, which gradually gained momentum as they writhed like a serpent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of the mock sword becomes red-hot, and the wind, raging with heat, violently flutters her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that amount ...... is ah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the moment Lisa swung the stacked twin swords crosswise as if playing with them, the stored heat was released all at once as if from a weir. Thud! With a roar, as if a volcano had exploded, a torrent of flames erupted and struck Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the oncoming torrent of flames, Irisdina held her sword over her shoulder and looked at it meditatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade, which had been harboring a pale light due to the enhancement magic, had somehow begun to shine so brightly that it could be seen from a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword blade  shines  in  a dark color. Perhaps  Irisdina continues to  cast  a spell, the blade of magical power, reminiscent of a night under a new moon, flickers and flickers like a beating heart, gradually increasing its brilliance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the glow of the magic sword increases, the sword qi emanating from her body grows even more intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, at the moment when the rising magic and sword qi reached a critical point, the blade was swung. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic sword was swung as if to reap the torrent of flames that was rushing toward it, gouging out the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A single sword, reminiscent of a meteor, slashes through the flames and extinguishes them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu involuntarily let out a cry of agitation as the blasted flames scattered across the training ground along with the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scattered flames quickly dissipate, and silence envelops the area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smoke that had been billowing up gradually clears, and the two figures appear unharmed by each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu was shocked by the devastation that had been etched into the training grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ground, seared by heat and blackened and charred, leads in a line from Lisa's feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ground,  which  had  been  burned  by  the  torrent  of  superheated  flames,  was  still  smoking, indicating the tremendous amount of heat inflicted in just a few seconds. The black lines on the ground were broken into two lines in front of Iris Dina's eyes and dissipated as if they had been wiped away by a drop of water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did she stop that karmic fire: ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic that Lisa unleashed was not the kind of power that even a high-ranking wizard could unleash. Without a doubt, it was as powerful as Tima Raim's "Hungry Beast of the Wind Cave," </p>
<p class="calibre1">which i saw in the Spasim Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina, who cut down such flames of Lisa from the front, was also tremendous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"no. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">what power is that? Are they getting stronger? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu unconsciously swallowed those words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unaware  of  the  words  that  crushed  and  crushed  him,  he  felt  suffocated,  as  if  he  had  been submerged under water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My hands naturally reached out to my chest, my fists clenched tightly, and my back teeth creaked as I bit down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wordlessly, Nozomu turns away to escape the pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was oblivious to the gazes of those who were waving at their back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as the billowing smoke subsided, Lisa and Irisdina lowered their swords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's  mock  sword  was  smoking  white  smoke,  probably  due  to  exposure  to  multiple reinforcement magic and high heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, the sword was made of inferior metal. Compared to her beloved sword, it was inferior in every aspect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina let out an exclamation of admiration as the sound of the sword blade cracking with a pithy crack flows in her ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Phew, that's a big one: ......' </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can you say that when you've already made a sweeping statement? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa also relaxed from her shoulders and released the saber in her hand to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mock sword she was using was already useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A simulated sword, which has melted and lost its blade halfway through, makes a dry clang sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How long have you had that magic sword ready?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been prepare it for you ever since we started hitting each other," she said. But you were so aggressive  that  it  took  me  almost  a  minute  to  make  it.  If  you  had  continued  to  attack  without backing down, I might have been pushed aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, i see. I'll take that as a compliment, in case you were wondering." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina quietly watched Lisa as she turned her back and walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Lisa Hounds. His former Lover? I'm told that she's now dating Ken Notice, who is also from his hometown. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's gaze fell on a blonde classmate who walked up to Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken Notis. He is a man with gentle smile, and when he comes to Lisa's side, his soft smile breaks even more as he hands her the potion in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa also accepted the proffered potion with a smile on her face and slowly sipped the contents as she began to talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is easy to see that they are quite close, as Lisa occasionally pokes Ken with her elbow, and Ken mumbles in her ear, causing Lisa, who was drinking a potion, to sob and choking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a scene that Iris Dina has seen many times since she and they were in the same class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Hmmm. Lovers, they say, well, I don't know. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina herself does not bother with it and has never considered the tactless act of intruding out of curiosity into the love lives of others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is the next head of one of the most noble families in the kingdom of Forsina, and is not involved in love to begin with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  is  a  human  being  who  has  been  studying  and  working  hard  to  fulfill  the  duties  that  are appropriate to her title. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, although I have heard of what the commoners call love, I have never really felt it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(And I don't know anything about them back then.) Judging them only by rumors and rumors of others, the atmosphere around them is a fool's errand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting  aside  for  the  moment  the  relationship  between  Nozomu  and  Lisa,  Irisdina  began  to ruminate on the mock battle that had just taken place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I guess I could have pushed it back if I could have deployed the lunar eclipse night a little faster ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm still a work in progress) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A magic sword that takes me more than ten seconds to make it. How can I make it in half a second like Nozomu Bountis? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the image of his blade in the forest in her mind, Irisdina continues her contemplation on how to reach even higher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it was because I was thinking of Nozomu. Suddenly, I turned my attention to the training ground next door, and there I saw the man, the one I was most interested in at the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the encounter in the forest of Spasim recalled in her mind, Irisdina gives a small wave toward Nozomu, as prompted by her curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu turned away with a huff ...... and walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignored. Such a thought comes to my mind, but I reconsider whether he just didn't notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She exhales loudly to drown out the frustrated look that comes to her face for a moment, and walks over  to  her  best  friend,  who  is  waiting  at  the  edge  of  the  training  ground  to  receive  the  potion herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"here, Iris." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, thank you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She drinks the potion offered by her best friend and recovers his depleted strength and magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of vitality is revived, and the mind is tightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next match is already underway on the training ground, and once again the sound of spirited voices and combat echoes through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually, she would watch her classmates fight and try to find moves that might be helpful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then she notices that her gaze naturally drifts to the training ground next door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ai, what's wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Called by Tima, Irisdina tries to focus on the mock battle in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the edge of my thoughts, the image of Nozomu was always flickering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina had forgotten about  the rumors  about  him  until Tima pointed them  out  to her, and had originally only overheard them and never heard the details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima, I need to ask you a few questions: ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He ...... about the Nosom Bountis rumors." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's eyes widen at the unexpected question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  this  day,  his  image  on  the  edge  of  her  thoughts  made  it  unusually  difficult  for  Iris  Dina  to concentrate as she finished her afternoon classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">After school, Nozomu's steps are heavy as he walks through the school's main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was same as usual, but I felt as if I were dragging lead all over my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was depressed by the scene of a first-class class being conducted next door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was because he had been confronted with the difference between himself and those women in a way that could not have been more different from what they are now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of this heartbreaking reality, a variety of emotions pass through Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why was I abandoned by her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why am I smoldering here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why can't I be strong? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why am I in so much pain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a thought that has floated through Nozomu's mind many times before. And at the same time, it was the one that had led him astray into a maze with no answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has no idea why Lisa dumped him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chains of ability suppression have also always bound him and prevented him from moving forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he can't even return to his hometown, having come to Arcazam against his father's objections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reality of being surrounded by a sense of entrapment leads  Nozomu  to  unconsciously stop thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-80"></a>He let his feet go forward into the spasim forest, lost in the fog of blurry thoughtlessness, sealed off by the reality and heartache he had just witnessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a habit he had practiced for more than a year, and a very common defensive behavior for humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, he did not start out this way either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while after the onset  of ability suppression,  I continued to  try to  believe that  I could  still manage, and when Lisa dumped me in the beginning, I asked her why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to his efforts, his abilities and grades did not improve, and Lisa only returned a cold stare and did not answer Nozomu's questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since that time, as he repeatedly asked himself unanswerable questions and was confronted with a reality he could not change, his heart was completely broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Back to Shisho, more rigorous training: ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in an attempt to mend even his broken heart, he tries to expose himself to even more rigorous training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  just as  Nozomu  was about  to  walk  through the central  park  with  a  gloomy feeling, a  girl's voice sounded as if she was in dire need of help from the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?" Whoa whoa whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, a small shadow jumped out from the grass on the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A larger shadow that came out to follow caught the smaller shadow that came out first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"got you: ....... Kyaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large shadow that catches a small shadow loses its balance in front of Nozomu and almost falls to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As quickly as he could, Nozomu reached out and supported the shadow that was about to fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia-chan?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shadow that popped up was Somia, whom I met at lunchtime today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They check each other out and look surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is going on?" It looks like you came out of the grass in a hurry. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, Kuro is at it...... again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-81"></a>If you look closely, you can see a black cat nestled in her propped-up arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black cat was wearing a Somia armlet around its neck, which also suggested that this black cat had misbehaved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. ....... I left it in the classroom during my afternoon practical skills class, and I think it came in through an open window. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haha, what a really prank cat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu slowly lowered Somia to the ground, his shoulders slumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia removes the bracelet from Kuro's neck and puts it back on her own hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuro was still scratching the arm ornament back on Somia's wrist with a crunching paw, as if he was still unmoved by the arm ornament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I'll leave now: ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Nozomu-san. Just a moment, please." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that she has regained his arm ornament, Nozomu decides that he is safe to go and tries to leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Somia waited for Nozomu's back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?" What else can I do for you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, well, that ......, can we meet again tomorrow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Eh, meet, why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've had the pleasure of working with you not once, but twice, and I'd like to talk more with you, Nozomu-san." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is troubled by Somia's gaze as she stares up at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it is the child's own purity and curiosity, but to be honest, his treatment at the school is quite poor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, the bullying and violence from  some of his  classmates  was  so severe that he was afraid that if he stayed by their side, they might harm him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, I have to go to Shino after school for training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"don't want to?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps sensing the mood of Nozomu's attempt to refuse, Somia looked up at him with a pleading gaze before he could reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As one would expect, it is hard for Nozomu to refuse when asked to do so much. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-82"></a>"I'm going to ...... and see if I get some help. But I can't do it after school, so we can only talk a little at lunchtime. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad to hear it! Well then, see you tomorrow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" No, hey, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu agreed, Somia smiled like a blossoming flower, and with the cat in her arms, she was off in a flash with a tattering, light-footed gait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  who  had  been  left  behind,  watched  her  disappear  into  the  shadows  of  the  city  in  the distance for a few moments in a daze, before smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a girl with so much momentum. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia was smiling with a smile that could not have been more joyful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although petite, she was full of energy, more than appropriate for her age, and the gloom of the earlier class had somehow faded away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a darkened corner of the garden, a girl of about ten years old was standing with her hand over her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loose-fitting clothing, with a low level of flamboyance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A candlestick with a light is placed at the foot of the room, and a book that appears to be a grimoire is placed in an open position beside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The sun shining on the earth is in my hands: ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A girl with jet-black hair that seems to melt in the dark night quietly spins a chant with beads of sweat on her forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a small sphere of light appeared in the girl's hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl used "bright light," a magic that illuminates the surroundings with a small ball of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the ball of light produced by the girl was as small as the tip of a thumb, and its luminous intensity was unsteady, swaying like the light of a firefly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ummm...ummmm......... Ah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">About ten seconds after the magic was activated, the light ball disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can i be like my sister? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what's wrong with me. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-83"></a>Tilting his head, the dark-haired youngster begins to look back at the grimoire spread out at his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was Somia, an Ecross student that Nozomu met today in the central park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Somia checks the contents of the grimoire by relying on the small light from the candelabra, a dignified voice is called to her back. </p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-9">
<p class="calibre1">"What are your talking about Somia?, you're so good" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Irisdina, the owner of the mansion, who approached her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane-sama" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Somia sees Irisdina, who has called her name, she smiles and rushes to her sister's side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's real name is Somiliana Francilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was the second daughter of the current head of the Francilt family and sister of Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina,  like  Somia,  has  now  changed  into  her  normal  indoor  clothes,  and  the  supernatural atmosphere at the school has faded away and she appears relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong?" Is there some magic you can't get right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, this is it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looks through the book that Somia has offered her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, the magic of bright light. There's a little trick to putting magic into it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bright light is a light magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Currently confirmed magic is classified into a total of six attributes: four attributes of earth, water, fire, and wind, and two attributes of light and darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  speed  and  accuracy  of  learning  each  attribute  of  magic  depends  on  the  individual's  own qualities,  but  basically,  the  lower  the  level  of  difficulty,  the  less  the  dependence  on  personal qualities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's specialty is the dark attribute, but if the magic is of the "bright light" level, using it is not much of a problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoping to be helpful to her sister, Irisdina raises her right palm and quickly completes the chant to produce a ball of light. The light sphere produced emitted a dazzling light and the amount of light was stable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia marvels at the magic of "Bright light" which has a completely different level of perfection from her own. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-84"></a>"Fluff...... As well as the tempo of the chanting, this magic should be strongly energized when it is invoked and then gradually reduced. Once you reach the amount of light that feels right, you maintain the amount of magic you send in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a hasty reply, Somia returns to her independent practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As before, she held up her palms, focused her attention, and spun the chant. As she deployed the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"bright  light" magic several  times in this way, Somia, who was  practicing her magic under the watchful eye of her sister, suddenly smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehehehe ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">You look happy, Somia. Did something good happen to you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yes. I have a new friend." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I made a friend. Irisdina looks a little surprised at Somia's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, like Irisdina, is a member of the high nobility, but because of her birth and upbringing, she was more sensitive than others to malice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia has a bright and cheerful personality, but she never approaches anyone who harbors ill will toward her or those around her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  was  therefore  intrigued  by  the  person  who  had  become  a  friend  of  her  younger,  but discerning, sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, what's that person like?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by her sister, Somia recalls the time she met Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's first impression of Nozomu was that he looked lonely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And those who wear an air of being somewhat superfluous, and don't want to get involved with others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But at the same time, I had an intuition that he was a very kind man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Otherwise, he wouldn't have helped me out of trouble in that place. ......) Somia stroked her armlet, which was now back on her arm, and said to herself in her mind, "I'll never forget this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is  a person who wears a lonely air, but  he is  a very kind  person. When Kuro took  this arm ornament Ane-sama give to me, he climbed a tree to get it back for me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"like that huh ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-85"></a>Irisdina, on the other hand, looked on with admiration at Somia, who was happily holding up the armlet she had gotten back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How are things at the academy, Ane-sama?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I've made the acquaintance of a few interesting people myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of person?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbeknownst to each other that they were thinking about the same person, Irisdina also talking about Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing she recalls is her encounter in the spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dazzlingly fine qi-sword. Seeing the precision with which he could create an extreme sword in less than half a second, Irisdina was intrigued by him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second is his appearance in the training area next door during today's practical class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the way he was watching the mock battle we had in class, Irisdina tried to wave at him, but unfortunately, he did not notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I wonder if it was because Lisa was there. Now that I think about it, he looked somewhat depressed from distance. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't really know what his personality is ...... to be honest. I've barely had a conversation with him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's unusual for Ane-sama to take an interest in someone she hasn't talked to much ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You right. Even I'm a little surprised. Well, it had a big impact when we first met." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina then began to talk about the spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was investigating a request from the Adventurers' Guild when she was caught off guard by a Demonic beast and was rescued by a male student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The male student cut down the mad bear that had attacked by surprise with a sword he had sharpen in less than half a second. His qi-jutsu accuracy is probably better than any other person I know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic and qi-jutsu may differ, but I don't think I could make a sword as good as his at the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who is said to be a failure showed a sword that seemed to be the supreme one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this gap, Irisdina finds herself more fascinated than she would like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such a terrific person!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The extremely unusual appearance of his sister also aroused Somia's interest in the man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-86"></a>However, she is unaware that the person her sister is referring to is the "kind Onii-chan" she met today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,  I didn't know that either. Well, it's  getting late. Go to sleep today, and don't work out too much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehh~!" Ane-sama, I would like to hear more about that man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No," she said. "It's past your bedtime. Sleep well so you can grow up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Muuu~." Ane-sama treats me like a child again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiles at her sister who complains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she was at an age when she wanted to grow taller in many ways, the sight of her younger sister looking her age was the greatest comfort and joy for her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know him very well yet either. Hmm, next time I get a chance to talk to him, I'll talk to Somia again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"M~~. Understood. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by her sister's words, Somia immediately returns to her room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina gazed at her sister's back with deep emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I knew it. You're still little.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Somia was smaller than other children her age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is largely due to the fact that Somia was born prematurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Kaa-sama ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The image of her mother, who died when she was a child, comes back to Irisdina's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's mother, originally a sickly woman, had died when she gave birth to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was when Irisdina had just turned six years old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, born prematurely, was also told that she would not live long, and there were times when she was heartbroken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miraculously, however, Somia survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her tiny little bodies, she fought back against death as best she could, getting through one day at a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of her inspired Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt the life of his deceased mother in his sister's attempt to live. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-87"></a>Then Irisdina decided to protect her sister and take over as head of the Francilt family, which she did with great bloody effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She has taken up the sword that noble daughters do not wield, studied imperialism, and disciplined herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, she had the talent and she is beginning to accumulate achievements at this school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, she is fully capable of using both sword and magic, and she maintains the top overall grade at Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The top rank in the highest academy in the continent. That is, extremely close to the highest on the continent in the same age group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is aware that who she is today because she has worked hard since she was a child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So I guess if you'd want to know ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is concerned about  Nozomu Bountis because of her age and her experience with unworthy endeavors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword he creates shows a glimpse of the effort he has put in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is  a despicable man who betrayed his  childhood friend who supported him so  desperately, huh? He didn't seem like that kind of person to me. ....." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the rumors about him that I heard from Tima were in the form of hearsay, and I could not hear about anyone who actually saw him with another woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is said that many people witnessed the sudden estrangement between the two, who had  actually  been  on  friendly  terms,  and  Lisa  Hounds'  one-sided  distancing  and  cold  attitude toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The circumstantial evidence alone suggests that the rumors are correct. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's story alone is inconclusive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina takes a break from unanswerable thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what kind of effort he put in before he was able to create that sword ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continued  effort  produces  great  empathy  and  resonance  with  those  who  have  had  similar experiences and empathy is a great force that rapidly shortens the distance between two strangers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that she is aware of the root of her own interest and sympathizes with the efforts that she and Nozomu  Bountis  have  accumulated,  Irisdina's  desire  to  "get  to  know  him"  begins  to  accelerate rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-88"></a>And that opportunity came sooner than expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days after Nozomu and Somia met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were sitting next to each other in the shade of a tree in a wooded area not far from the grassy area of the central park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But was it good?" he asked. "It's a nice lunch break, and you're with me. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've talked to my friends and they understand, so I'm fine. More importantly, let's talk!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, if you say so, Somia-chan. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some time after their first meeting, they would talk like this in Central Park during their lunch break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, Nozomu is not good at talking, and it is usually Somia who speaks; he is more of a listener. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, on Somia's thigh, sitting on the ground, lies the black cat that led to their meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I asked my sister for a favor. She said she would to talk to me some more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And what did she say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She told me, It's already late and you should go to bed early so you can grow up. I'm not a child anymore~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu listens to her as he looks at Somia, who is stroking the throat of a mischievous cat lying on her thigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of her stories were about her sister, who was six years older than her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She has her own sister as her target. She is a girl who never stops smiling, but when she talks about her "sister," she smiles 50% more than usual and talks happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'My sister is strong,' 'My sister is cool,' 'My sister is kind.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, her sister is a person of outstanding character and ability, and from the way her face broke into a smile as she spoke, it was clear that Somia truly admired and longed for this "sister". </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, perhaps because the two sisters came to Arcazam together, they sometimes worry too much like their mother. A few days ago, she told her to go to bed early if she stayed up too late at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, Somia-chan, you are ten years old. You aret a child in terms of age. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-89"></a>"Mwah, you say that too, Nozomu~san!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, in fact ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In human society on the Arkmill continent, a person is considered an adult at the age of fifteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Somia is small in stature compared to her peers, and her age makes Nozomu believe that she should be treated as a child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps sensing Nozomu's inner thoughts, Somia puffed up her cheeks like a puffer fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu smiles wryly at the girl's moody state, but decide to follow up anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think your sister would want to embarrass you, Somia-chan?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I know. I just wanted to say it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The look of dissatisfaction on his face changes to a broad smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia-chan, you really like your sister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! that It's my dream, my goal!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia speaks clearly and straightforwardly about her dreams and aspirations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite what she said with her mouth, she did not seem to have changed her mind at all about the biggest book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her appearance is  a bit dazzling to Nozomu, who has been drifting at the bottom of the pile, a perennial dropout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was wondering, "By the way, Somia-chan,  you talk about  your sister a lot, is she a student at Solminati Academy too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,  yes!  Yes,  it  is.  She's  now  a  sophomore.  You  are  also  a  student  at  the  school,  aren't  you, Nozomu-san? What's life like at Solminati Academy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yeah. Um, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's question made Nozomu feel as if a lead was building up in the pit of his stomach, and he was at a loss for words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I exhale loudly once more, as if I am being tied to a chain and dragged down to the bottom of the water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Well, I wouldn't say it's going well. Sorry Somia-chan, but my rank is in the bottom ten." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu shows Somia the nameplate with his name on it with a thin smile of self-mockery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The simple nameplate, dyed all black, is a testament to the lowest class in the school year. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-90"></a>People  from  outside  the  school  who  don't  know  anything  about  the  school,  but  those  who  are involved with the school, will not have a good impression of the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. Then you are just like me. Unlike my sister, I'm not quite there yet!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to Nozomu's expectation, Somia answered shyly with a carefree smile and a lisp on her tongue. There was not the slightest hint of unnaturalness in her expression, as if she was trying to fit in with the conversation on purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She truly and sincerely understood her immaturity and at the same time firmly accepted herself as such. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's face, which had been filled with self-mockery, is now stained with surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, with Somia's smile like a ray of sunshine, the poison that had been hovering in Nozomu's chest quietly dissipated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(She's a very strong girl. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if she has not yet reached secondary sexual characteristics, she is only as small as Nozomu's waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But his small body looked so big to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Kuro, who had been lying on Somia's thighs, collapses onto her back and begins to snuggle into her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Somia's right wrist, which Kuro jostled, was fitted with an arm ornament that had twice been stolen by this black cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">''I asume it that your ornament hasn't been stolen today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">''Yes, indeed, they even let me wear it in the classroom, so I try to wear as much as I can.'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu peeks sideways at Kuro, who scratches her arm ornament with a crunching paw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that the arm ornament is delicately decorated and has a small bell-like ornament with letters engraved on it that I have never seen before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The materials  used were not  clear, but  even the untrained eye could  guess  that they were quite valuable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">''That ornament looks pretty valuable, isn't it?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">''This  arm  ornament  has  been  in  my  family  for  generations.  It  is  said  that  it  is  something  that connects the bonds of a family, and that if you have it, even if you are separated, you will surely meet again someday. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-91"></a>"Wow, that's a very happy saying." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! It was originally sitting in storage at home, but my sister gave it to me for my birthday last year! No matter how hard things get, it's okay. Our bond is strong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia seems really happy to talk about the ornament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For her, the lore is one thing, but perhaps most of all, she is happy to have the family connection at hand as an actual object. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  remember  you said  you got that ornament  for  your birthday last  year, when is  Somia-chan's birthday?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's almost come. Father is out of town, so he won't be able to attend, but my sister is throwing a party for us again this year, so I'm really looking forward to it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. ...... Good for you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's full smile brings a smile to Nozomu's cheeks as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he smiled was somewhat shadowy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu used to have people to celebrate his birthday, but now he has no one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The loneliness that tormented his heart from within subconsciously clouded his smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, noticing the shadows that cloud Nozomu's smile, cringes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?" What's wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, it's nothing. But, Kuro, are you still aiming for it about it, That's enough!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia,  sensing  a  glimpse  of  the  loneliness  that  Nozomu  was  carrying,  unintentionally  tried  to make up for it and used Kuro, who was still playing with his arm ornament, as an excuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a somewhat theatrical movement, he raises his arm and peeks at Nozomu, keeping his arm ornament away from Kuro. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black cat, perhaps still not satisfied with its play, now stood up on its hind legs and began flapping its paws like a baby that has had a toy taken away from it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  the  all-important  Nozomu,  oblivious  to  Somia's  condition,  sighs  at  the  black  cat's refusal to give up her arm ornament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But then again, he's a very brawny male cat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-92"></a>"I mean, He took Your belongings without your permission, he played with it a lot, and he haven't played with it enough. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's see. ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's gaze swept through the air, as if she was having difficulty saying something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Nozomu  tilts  her  head  at  Somia's  stupefied  expression,  she  opens  her  mouth  with  an embarrassed look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san. Kuro-chan, it's a girl. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">So it's a girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the word "girl," Nozomu involuntarily shuts down. This black cat is apparently a female. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bravado and the brawl he had with Nozomu made me think that she was a male. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, why its name Kuro? Isn't that the name you usually give to males?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "Eh? It's just kind of a feeling." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is unable to say anything more at Somia's outspoken words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, her sense of naming is a bit out of step with the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And Kuro-chan's owner, it wasn't me, and I think she's probably a stray." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She told me that she sometimes saw her around the Ecross school building and then they started playing together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, this cat does not even have a collar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was wondering if it was a stray or not. She seems to be very friendly and has beautiful fur, so I thought she was kept by Somia-chan. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Kuro had beautiful fur for a stray cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that in mind, Nozomu just reached out to ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A relentless claw strike is delivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had indeed gotten used to it and quickly dodged the swiping claws, but judging from the way his tail hairs stood up and his fangs bared, it seemed that Nozomu was completely disliked by this cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you all right? Kuro-chan is difficult and doesn't really like people who don't like her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is that right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-93"></a>"Yes, all the boys in the class were no good. The girls are fine. ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Isn't that just simply no for men? ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, this black cat only misses girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While she bared hher fangs at Nozomu and threatened him, she was quiet in Somia's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu stared at Kuro, the black cat glanced at Nozomu, but immediately turned away and began to relax in Somia's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary, she stretched out his paws and tried to flirt with Somia's arm ornament again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, God, no, Kuro-chan!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She plays with Somia arm ornament with her paws, not caring about Somia's attention. In a sense, this is a very cat-like attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, by the way, Somia, what did you have for lunch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Emm, I'm supposed to eat with my sister today. I think she will be here in a little while." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I think it's time for me to leave now. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehh, why? Let's eat together." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, your sister doesn't know me, right?. ...... for a stranger to suddenly mix in with a group of sisters." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's all right. Nozomu-san is my friend, and my sister will understand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You say so, but I still ...... refrain from ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was about to refuse again when a cool, dignified voice floated between the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia, here you are." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia  was  the  first  to  react  to  the  echoing  voice.  Her  expression  turned  into  a  smile  as  she identified the owner of the voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Ane-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, your sister's here, ......, eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can find it at ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu looked past Somia, who stood up and ran by Nozomu's side with a ta-ta-ta, there stood Irisdina Francilt, whom he had met the other day in the Spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two lunch bags are lowered in Iris Dina's hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  surprised  by  the  unexpected  appearance  of  someone,  but  Irisdina  also  looked surprised as she received her sister, who ran up to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-94"></a>"I'm surprised. I didn't realize the new friend Somia was talking about was you. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, Somia-chan your sister is ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, my last name is Francilt! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... really?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to affirm Nozomu's concern, Somia responded innocently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francilt.  Like  Irisdina,  this  is  the  name  of  a  very  prestigious  noble  family  in  the  Kingdom  of Forsina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  think  about  it,  a  beautifully  decorated  armlet  is  quite  valuable  and  not  something  a commoner can afford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her glossy black hair also matches their features, and moreover, the fact that she is six years older than Somia means that her sister is around 16 years old. She is around the same age as Nozomu, which is consistent with Irisdina's age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I should have realized it -----!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  when  he  first  met  Somia,  Nozomu  almost  superimposed  Irisdina  on  her,  but  his  mind stopped functioning due to fatigue from the intense training from Shino, and it never occurred to him that the two were sisters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since then, Nozomu has forgotten all about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt intensely dizzy as he stifled the urge to scream, remembering his casual conversation with the great noble bloods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's that?" Did you know my sister, Nozomu-san?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yeah. I mean, I know her, or I know her one way or another. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rubbing his temples, Nozomu somehow manages to accept the current situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, would you like to have lunch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes. And Irisdina-sama as well?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I said the other day, you don't have to put on a honorific. In Arcazam, the status of the deceased does not mean much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ha ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  though  Arcazam  was  originally  built  with  loans  from  various  countries,  the  status  of  its birthplace is not considered within the academy due to the purpose of its establishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina waves her hand in a light tone and hands Somia one of the lunch bags she was carrying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-95"></a>"Come on, Somia, it's time for lunch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Ane-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you like to join us, Nozomu-kun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widen involuntarily at Irisdina's abrupt words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia said yes, but he never imagined that the black-haired princess would also invite him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  is  a  popular  student  with  both  men  and  women  because  of  her  caring  and  dependable personality,  as  well  as  her  appearance  and  ability.  Naturally,  she  must  have  received  countless invitations to dinner, and is sure to take no notice of inferior students like Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though they had a chance encounter with each other, Nozomu was unexpectedly cowed by the sudden invitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, since Nozomu and his group are now in a wooded area, their view of others is blocked by trees, but if they were to move to a more public lawn area, they would quickly become the talk of the town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu was being watched in many ways at the school, he did not want to do anything that would stand out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, I'll pass. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's eat together, Nozomu-san. Hora hora!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly tried to balk at the invitation, but before he could speak, Somia grabbed him by the arm and covered him with words to seal him off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was almost taken out of the forest area by Somia without knowing why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm...are you not like noisy things, Nozomu-kun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, I'm sorry, but the lawn area is a bit ...... crowded." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then let's eat here. I don't mind the quiet either. Somia, too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anywhere with my friend Nozomu-san!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who was halfway up his hips, was held by Somia, who had just pulled his arm, by the shoulder and made to sit down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sisters settle down a bit in front of Nozomu, who remains puzzled, in a natural gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, where's your lunch?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I bought one." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-96"></a>Saying this,  Nozomu  held up a paper bag that lay  at  his  feet.  Three pieces  of black bread with appropriate  vegetables  and  dried  intestines  sandwiched  between  them.  They  were  the  cheapest items in the stall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san, are you sure that's what you want?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, it's not like I have that much in my pocket. Oh, by the way, Irisdina-san. What about......Tima-san" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After the morning class, I was summoned by Jihad-sensei. She told me to have lunch first, so I came here to look for Somia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad-Sensei is the head teacher at this solminati school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad Raundel. He was one of the strongest swordsmen on the continent who played an active role in the disaster caused by the great migration of Demonic beasts that occurred 20 years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great migration of Demonic beasts that occurred on the Arkmill continent 20 years ago spilled over  into  the  northeastern  part  of  the  continent  and  spilled  over  into  the  disaster  that  was  later called the "Great Invasion". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  were  killed  in  this  "Great  Invasion,"  and  numerous  refugees flooded into neighboring countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The countries of the continent took the situation seriously and cooperated, sending their armies to defeat the invading demonic beasts, which were somehow managed to be repelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the scars from this disaster were so deep that several countries collapsed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless casualties and refugees fleeing from exhausted and collapsed countries caused a rapid deterioration  of  security  in  the  countries  that  were  safe.  Countries  throughout  the  continent suffered totaldamage as a result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Solminati Academy was created to train the human resources lost in the great invasion, and Arcazam was created to further promote and integrate the technological research on qi and magic that had been conducted independently by each country until then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, you needn't worry about Tima. Anyway, let's eat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by Irisdina, the three began to eat at a leisurely pace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  Irisdina  and  Somia's  lunch  bag  was  a  sandwich  of  beautiful,  fresh  ham,  eggs,  and  colorful vegetables on fine white bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-97"></a>The food itself was not fancy, but the attention to detail by the chefs was evident in the way each sandwich was wrapped in a napkin to prevent hands from getting dirty from the sauces and other ingredients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among these, what particularly caught Nozomu's eye was the embroidered stitching on Iris Dina's lunch bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strangely cute puppy embroidery sewn into the luxurious fabric makes me smile and laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  could  not  hide  his  surprise  at  the  unexpected  belongings  of  Iris  Dina,  who  exudes  a dignified and somewhat supernatural air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Is something wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, well, I saw something a little unexpected ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph, About Ane-sama, she love dogs. I think kitty is much prettier." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, Irisdina seems to be a dog lover. Since her younger sister was a cat lover, Nozomu had thought that her sister also liked cats, but it seems that sisters have different tastes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the older sister, who has had a surprising revelation made to her by her younger sister, looks a little disgruntled and frowns as she takes a bite of her sandwich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia, I understand that you are a cat lover, but dogs are no that bad either. Especially puppies, whose loveliness is a treasure that has no equal in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Eh, that's the one you're not happy with?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for Nozomu, I thought she was unhappy about being revealed as a dog lover, but surprisingly, as for Irisdina, she was more unhappy about being told that dogs are inferior to cats in terms of cuteness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I know you love dogs, but I think cats are the best! Hey~ Kuro-chan." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, on the other hand, while acknowledging the cuteness of the puppies, is not willing to give up the best as a cat lover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She strokes Kuro's throat as she places it on her lap, it chest heaving with a snort and a challenging smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's not. The way she followed me around, wagging her tail, so lovable, you couldn't help but want to hug her! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are the one, Ane-sama, look at how cute this little Kuro is! Like the way he rumbles when you stroke his throat, isn't she just the cutest thing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-98"></a>And so the dog-cat talk begins. Is it a dog or a cat that is truly cute? Neither Irisdina nor Somia will budge at all, and they try to break down their opponents by developing various theories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia describes the healing effect of the cat's softness, and Irisdina counters with the healing effect of the empathy of the dog, a social animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Irisdina talks about the history of dogs and humans and says that they are man's most reliable partner and that it is cute to see them always cuddling up to each other, Somia counters that cats are the cutest when they are spoiled because they are not dependent on people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  both  men  use  a  variety  of  approaches  in  their  arguments,  they  cannot  reach  a  clear conclusion because the final logical conclusion comes down to an extremely subjective sense of cuteness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, of course, they would not have given up their opinions to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, um, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  who  was  completely  left  out  of  the  never-ending  discussion  between  the  sisters,  just uttered the words, "Wait a minute." </p>
<p class="calibre1">We could talk about how cute dogs and cats are, but it is almost time for afternoon classes to begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, I got carried away. Somia, we'll talk about this another time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, this is the 357th cat-and-dog meeting, but we'll have to wait until the next meeting to settle the matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, Somia, it's a dog and cat conference." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heated discussion between Somia and Irisdina was put to rest, and the three resumed eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu almost let out a sigh at the fact that we have had this discussion 357 times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, how did you and Ane-sama meet, Nozomu-san? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  the  dog-cat  discussion  was  over,  Somia's  interest  next  shifted  to  the  encounter  between Nosom and her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a twinkle in her deep black eyes, she asks him about Nozomu's encounter with her sister, seemingly intrigued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, it just so happens to be ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think I already told Somia a little about him, but he saved my life when I was caught off guard by a Demonic beast in the forest. In less than a second, he sliced the mad bear in two with a qi-sword that he had sharpened." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-99"></a>While  Nozomu  was  slumped,  not  knowing  how  to  answer,  Irisdina  was  answering  Somia's questions in a smooth and concise manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia,  perhaps  unable  to  hide  her  excitement  at  finding  out  that  Nozomu  is  the  'person  her esteemed sister praises as great' that her sister has been talking about recently, leans forward and brings her face close to her sister's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? The great person Ane-sama was talking about was Nozomu-san!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"yes, that right" she said. Tima was almost attacked, but he saved the day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's  voice,  as  she  recounted  the  scene,  was  unaffected,  but  laced  with  an  admiration  and exuberance that could not be concealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inspired by her older sister's words, Somia's eyes begin to take on a strong tinge of longing as she looks at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think so. In fact, I'm an ability suppressor, and I'm at the bottom of the class at my school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu, perhaps unable to bear such praise from Irisdina and Somia, turned his gaze away from them with a huff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the hint of negative emotion, which is somewhat strong for a humble ......, Irisdina puts her hand over her mouth as if in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, that's odd. How can you make that air swords and come in last place?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've never used it at the academy because it's too deadly," he said. "Because of the suppression of my abilities, my physical enhancements have little effect, and my qi level is so low that I can count on one hand the number of times I can hit with that qi sword." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That, too, assumes no other qijutsu is used at all, adds Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In other words, if you use body reinforcement, you can only fire one or two blows with that qi-sword. If that's the case, shouldn't we have a party?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nobody wants to work with me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina frowned at Nozomu's words, which he mumbled as if to spit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu feels uncomfortable in the face of the sharp gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because of ability suppression?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... yeah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A slight pause in the reply calls for a deep silence between Nozomu and Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-100"></a>But that void told us that this was not the whole reason why Nozomu could not work with anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't mean to put it this way, but it's not always just brute force that's needed in a fight, is it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know your way around the spasim forests, and I'm sure there are many who would want that knowledge." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What makes you think that ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After you left me, you headed deeper into the forest, didn't you? That means you spent that night in the forest. The Spasim Forest is a forest overrun with Demonic beasts. It is not a place where a person without sufficient knowledge and ability about that forest can stay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Nozomu stayed at Shino's hut, and that area is almost inaccessible to Demonic beasts. After all, it is a place where a dangerous person of the dragon class resides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,  Irisdina  is  right,  Nozomu  has  spent  more  nights  in  the  spasim  forest  than  he  can count in the experience itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's because Shisho said to me, "Train!" The reason  I was thrown out into the forest at night with a single word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is your breakup with Lisa the reason why you're not having a party? Or heartless words from your classmates? Or is there another reason?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's question, which strikes at the heart of the matter, pierces deeply into Nozomu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dull ache and a feeling of bitterness filled his mouth, and Nozomu shushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the image of Lisa looking down at me with cold eyes, my classmates hurling mindless curses at me, and my own current situation of just holding my knees in front of them all come back to my mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vision becomes distorted and the sounds of the surroundings become more distant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "Don't get me wrong, I don't know about the veracity of those rumors and I'm not willing to speculate on what I don't know. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... excuse me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Irisdina could finish, Nozomu restrained her and sat up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  unconscious  escape  from  reality,  which  had  already  become  a  habit,  refused  to  listen  to Irisdina's words any longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry Somia-chan, I'll go home first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-101"></a>Somia watched in dismay as Nozomu walked away, but eventually looked to her sister for help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia could not understand why Nozomu suddenly got up from his seat, but she thought that her sister might know the reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane-sama ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia probably didn't know this, but he's not well-liked by the students at the academy," she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And maybe because of his poor grades, they treat him like he doesn't belong there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"things like that......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, upon learning of Nozomu's current situation, looks sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I said that to Somia, but I'm sure that's not cross the line of it. ......) Irisdina, who has had her fair share of experience with people's ill will in aristocratic society, could not believe that Nozomu was simply being ignored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An attitude that clearly shows glimpses of distrust and insecurity toward others. The characteristics of a person who has actually been maliciously directed and broken were apparent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I didn't think enough about his situation either. I shouldn't have.......) At the same time, Irisdina's actions were somewhat too hasty to close the distance to such a person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I stepped in a little too far. Maybe I did a bad thing. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina has a batty look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For her part, she just wanted to know a little bit about him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The qi sword when he saved his best friend in the forest and how he acquired so much skill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to ask him about the rumors about him that have been spreading in the school, if possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  not  willing  to  believe  only  rumors,  and  in  fact,  she  was  about  to  say  so,  even  though Nozomu herself might not give her a good look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu's rejection was more than she expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sister, you might want to clear up the misunderstanding: ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know. I'll make sure we have a good talk next time I see him ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding at her sister's suggestion, Irisdina brings the remaining sandwich to her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lunch, which is usually so delicious, was strangely bland and tasteless, like chewing sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Irisdina and the others, Nozomu, with a frown on his face, was on his way to the academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-102"></a>The pain that I had forgotten in the rigorous training is returning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The suffocation as if the troat were clogged and the heart beating violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It urges him to return to make sure Irisdina's true intentions are properly confirmed, and he tries to put a lid on his thoughts, as if to tell me to forget the pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two nozomu collide deep in the chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had no intention of leaving the place, but the pain of the old wound that had cut him open made him realize that he had to leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa was not the only one who gave up on him when that rumor broke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of them, even those who were once friends of Nozomu, uniformly rejected and discarded him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bitter thoughts flood my mouth, and I bite my back teeth to hold them together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, unexpected figures entered Nozomu's line of sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One men and two women enjoying lunch in the shade of a tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One is Nozomu's best friend, Ken Notis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  other  is  Camilla  Vecknose,  a  female  student  with  steeple-colored  hair  cut  roughly  at  the shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  a  female  student  that  Lisa  befriended  when  she  entered  this  school  and  was  one  of Nozomu's friends in the first grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, how's your end-of-year exam preparation going?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't see the problem. I don't think you need to be particularly uptight about it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And another, an eye-catching looking female student with crimson hair tied back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he saw her, Nozomu's chest thumped with a single loud beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a confident air in her winsome eyes, she is Lisa Hounds, the woman Nozomu has been most attracted to in his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the past, Nozomu would have turned away the moment he saw her on these streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he was so disturbed by Irisdina's words that he was too late to notice the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's eyes caught the sight of Nozomu standing there, her victorious eyes widening, followed by a color full of resentment and anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly  Lisa's  expression  changed,  and  Ken  and  Camilla  followed  her  gaze,  then  noticed Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-103"></a>Camilla's eyes were tinged with anger, as was Lisa's, and Ken's eyes widened in surprise as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... long time no see, Nozomu." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Ken who first approached me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a smile on his mouth, but it is somewhat tinged with nervousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also involuntarily shuts down in front of his former best friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is the one Lisa is said to have started dating after she broke up with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to maintain his composure, but his heart continues to pound and pound and pound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ah, long time no see, and you two ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't talk to me so casually. I mean, are you still in this school?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla, on the other hand, looks at Nozomu with disgust and spits contempt at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was one of the people who most vehemently rejected Nozomu when rumors of him spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite her hostile attitude, Nozomu turns his attention to the woman he cares most about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... that is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's cold, colorless eyes glare at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The back of my chest creaks. A feeling of suffocation hits Nozomu, as if his throat is being chained shut, and he is unable to speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tried to plead his innocence to her several times when the rumors first began to spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, his heart froze in the days of rejection by her and others around him, and before long, he was unable to even raise his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  Lisa's  wish  to  clear  up  the  misunderstanding  was  bound  by  the  chains  of  resignation  and aversion to pain, which sank deep into his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But a point of view from Iris Dina accidentally created a slight slack in that chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rejection that arose when the lid of my unconscious mind was about to be opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mind,  shaken  by  pain  and  turmoil,  temporarily  swings  in  the  opposite  direction  of  what  it normally does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was much like a spring trying to return to its original position after being subjected to a strong force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, talk to Lisa properly at ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I mean, you know, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The will of direct appeal that peeked slightly from the back of Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-104"></a>However, what he finally managed to squeeze out of his nervous throat was something completely different from what Nozomu had intended to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The will that peeked out from the surface of the water soon shriveled up and sank into the darkness, like a piece of driftwood chained to a weight, leaving a gaping hole deep in the chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa says to Nozomu with a blank look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't come near me. I don't want to see your face, so get the hell out of my sight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's words, reminiscent of a sharp spear slashing, pierced Nozomu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole body is at a standstill and thinking stops. A feeling of being disconnected from my head and body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain of having it crushed is far, far greater than usual because of the desire to temporarily clear up a misunderstanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the stiffened nozomu, Lisa quickly turns her head away and stands up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you won't go away, I'll go somewhere else." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was, Lisa turned on her heel and walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu gazes petrified at her back, he suddenly feels a powerful shock in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ggh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was pushed away, and involuntarily fell on his buttocks. When he looked up, Camilla was looking down at him with a look of indignation and anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa would never listen to you after all this time, you damn traitor!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla spat at Nozomu, and then she quickly followed Lisa's footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken turns on his heel without saying a word, though he has a somewhat complicated expression on his face at the sight of Nozomu's collapsed body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, alone, could only nod his head, unable to stand up. </p>
