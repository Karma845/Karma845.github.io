<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; An Unforgettable Birthday</h3>

<p class="calibre1">The day of Somia's birthday party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After class, Nozomu returned to the dormitory and immediately headed to Francilt residence, still in his school uniform, to bring a present for Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu does not have clothes for a noble daughter's birthday party, nor can he afford to buy them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu arrived at the front gate of the Irisdina mansion where the party was to be held, he was simply overwhelmed by the sheer size of the mansion towering before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The size of the mansion, where the daughter of one of the most aristocratic families in the kingdom of Forsina resides, is one or two times larger than the other mansions in this section of the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  three-story  building  made  of  marble,  and  may  be  large  enough  to  accommodate  all  the residents of a small village. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The garden, as well as the mansion, is vast, and a fence more than three times the height of a person surrounds the outside of the large grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he had not really felt it at the academy, Nozomu was once again reminded that Irisdina was a person of extremely high status. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......the venue, this is the place, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">'"...........oh" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a really big mansion,....... Onii-chan, please don't do anything weird again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Ena, who were next to Nozomu, were also overwhelmed by the mansion, which was so large and majestic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Emm rather, why is Ena-chan here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu raised his voice in question at the sight of Ena standing next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason why Mars is attending the party is to apologize to Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither Ena nor Hannah would allow him to leave things as it were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Ena was not invited to the party in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was tilting his head, Mars was awkwardly looking away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san, I didn't come here to attend the party" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, then what for?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-224"></a>"It's to apologize together with him to the person whose onii-chan was being rude the other day. I don't trust him to apologize properly by himself, so I forced him to come with me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently,  the  reason  Ena  came  here  was  to  monitor  whether  or  not  Mars  would  properly apologize to Tima, who got involved with him in the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Mars was not very happy with Ena's presence here, "Hmph!" He is sniffing and snickering </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars...... you......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked at Mars in dismay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was beyond pathetic that he couldn't even apologize without his sister's company." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't look at me like I'm a coward! I told her I was fine, and she just followed me on her own!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about! If it was just you, you'd just say something weird and make things worse!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seriously, that's enough! Are you my mother?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, Mars rebelled against Nozomu who was glaring at him with a glare, and Ena raised her voice at Mars' outburst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mother? You've got to be kidding! If it were me, I would raise him to be a gentleman who is kind to everyone! I don't want a child with such a big figure!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gentleman? A sister who beats up his own brother using a chair in our store as a weapon could raise a gentleman? That's ridiculous!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, hey, you two......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The siblings  are cursing  each other in  front  of the front  gate of a magnificent  mansion without being seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the Dickens siblings, it was the usual banter, but this was not the commercial district where they are used to seeing the commotion they cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of them were making a big fuss in the normally quiet administrative district, which was very conspicuous to the onlookers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally,  the  three  of  them  attracted  the  attention  of  people  passing  by,  which  was  very embarrassing for Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They call out to somehow stop the Dickens siblings, but the parties are so preoccupied with the war of tongues that they do not realize how conspicuous they are. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-225"></a>In  the  meantime,  a  squeaky  ......  and  creaking  metal  sounded,  and  a  maid  who  appeared  to  be working in the house appeared from inside the gate of the Francilt mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me," she said. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't make such a racket in front of the mansion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  rushes  forward  and  bows  her  head  at  the  maid's  words,  which  are  crude  but  clearly offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waah, so.., so sorry, my companion has been making a lot of noise. We've been invited to Somia-cha ...... Somiliana-san birthday party today ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you the ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maid scowled and clearly looked at Nozomu and the others with suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Mars are wearing Solminati Academy uniforms, but Ena is in her regular clothes and apron that she wears when she works at the Gyuto-tei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the source of the commotion behind Nozomu is unaware of this maid who appeared from the Francilt mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As usual, the Dickens siblings were arguing loudly behind his back, and Nozomu could only smile dryly in front of the maid who was looking at him as if she was smelling something stinky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am terribly sorry, sir, but we cannot allow suspicious people into the mansion" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a moment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, Ojō-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, the maid tried to close the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina appeared from behind and stopped the maid from closing the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Irisdina, there is also Tima, who, like Nozomu, is wearing the school's uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Hello, Nozomu-kun, you've come. They are my friends. You can let them through. I'll show you around, you go back to your duties." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, Ojō-sama" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Irisdina-san" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maid left in a hurry at the arrival of her master, and Nozomu let out an unintentional sigh of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, we can't turn away guests we invited at our doorstep. How long are they going to do that, by the way ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, with her neat appearance and a smile that captivates everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At her point, Nozomu turned back and involuntarily slumped his shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-226"></a>Mars and Ena are still arguing, oblivious to the appearance of the party organizers, and a crowd has already begun to form around them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was amazing, in a way, that they could concentrate so much on their argument without worrying about their surroundings, but as a friend of Nozomu, all he could do was sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"These guys ......... Hey, I'm going inside. How long have you guys making noise!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">""Huh?"" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Ena finally noticed Nozomu's loud voice and let out an interjection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, once they turned their attention to Nozomu, they began to scurry around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then they finally noticed their lasciviousness and rushed over to Nozomu and the others in a panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, if you noticed it, tell me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, Nozomu-san! It was embarrassing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ e~~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... pfft." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's shoulders drop as they say something so unreasonable to him while turning red in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina let out a chuckle at the sight of the three of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufufu. It looks fun. But Nozomu-kun, if you don't mind, could you introduce me to her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's gaze turned to Ena, who was standing beside Nozomu and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, by the way, this is the first time you've met Ena-chan, isn't it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, yes. As you may have heard, I am Irisdina Franscilt. Nice to meet you" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes! I'm Ena Dickens" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena was intimidated by Irisdina's mood and nervously introduced herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, who was standing behind Irisdina, smiled and spoke to Ena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, I'm Tima Lime. Nice to meet you, Ena-chan" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, you must be Tima-san. I apologize for the trouble my foolish brother caused you the other day" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Ena realized that the person her brother had tangled with was the woman in front of her, she bowed deeply and apologized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was a little amused by this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. Don't worry about it......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The woman's face was a little pale and her eyes were reddish. It was your fault to begin with!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-227"></a>"So you're my mother! You're the one making it hard for me to talk to her!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What!  You  can't  apologize  on  your  own  anyway!  That's  why  I  should  be  the  first  one  to apologize!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I told you that was unnecessary!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, wait a minute! You guys, this is not a good time for another fight!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quarrel between the siblings flared up again. Nozomu, not wanting to take things any further, tries to come between the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu ... fufufu, ahaha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of these three people, Irisdina involuntarily held her belly and began to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, Mars, and Ena are stiffened by the laughter of an unexpected person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, who was standing next to Irisdina, was also surprised to see her best friend laughing so hard, her mouth hanging open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I never thought Ai would laugh so hard ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's words were overheard by Nozomu, who inwardly agrees with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Irisdina he had seen so far was somewhat supernatural and clearly from a different world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was a person who never wavered, who was dignified, who took on her responsibilities, and who went straight ahead without hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the girl who is smiling in front of me now does not give me such a detached impression; she is the very image of a girl of the same age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, I'm sorry I laughed suddenly. Both of you are very close." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, that ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh, well……" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"... Yes, Ena-chan, right? Would you like to join my sister's party?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena's expression is surprised by the sudden offer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, but ... I've never been to a party in a mansion like this, and today I came with my brother's apology. Besides, I'm dressed like this, and I haven't prepared any gifts ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While saying that, Ena seems to be quite hesitant, glancing at her brother next to ner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's sudden offer also made Mars scratch his head awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Mars had already bought some of these items before coming to the party. He had bought some honey and sugar confectionery from the commercial district. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-228"></a>Sweetness is one of the best pastimes. You could get as many as you could with the Francilt family, but you still had to prepare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, You don't even have to worry about what to wear. It's a family party, so there's no need to be  so  formal.  Besides,  at  times  like  this,  it's  important  to  celebrate.  Somia  would  rather  have someone to celebrate with than a gift" </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, it was Ena who chose these sweets, and the cost was covered by Mars' allowance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, if Ena had chosen the item and Mars had funded it, the sweets could be said to be a present sent by the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, the organize is saying that. I paid for it, but you the one chose it......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I...... understand. If I'm not intruding, I'll join" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena hesitated for a moment, but with the encouragement of Irisdina and her brother, she decided to attend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will show you to the venue. Please follow me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  Irisdina's  lead,  Nozomu  and  the  others  walked  through  the  gate  and  into  the  huge mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they passed through the main entrance, they were greeted by a luxurious yet elegant hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were five maids in the entrance hall, who bowed deeply to Irisdina and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the maids steps out in front of Nozomu and Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am sorry, sir, but I must take your sword" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is a nobleman's mansion. Naturally, It's not allowed to bring weapons into the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Mars left their weapons in the hands of the maid, who received them and went into a room next to the entrance that appeared to be a storage room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After depositing their belongings, the group was led to the hall where the party was to be held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hall, which is also used for venue, was very spacious, with soft carpeting on the floor and an elaborately carved fireplace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  walls  and  pillars  are  also  decorated  with  elegant,  understated  carvings  and  portraits  of  the successive heads of the Francilt family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were already about two or three dozen people at the party, almost all of whom were dressed in  maids'  and  butlers'  uniforms,  and  it  seemed  that  most  of  the  participants  were  people  who worked at the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And at the far end of the hall is Somia, the star of this party. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-229"></a>Near her were three girls wearing Ecross uniforms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were probably Somia's classmates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The party itself seemed to be a standing buffet, with a variety of dishes lined up on tables at the end of the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Salads, soups, meat dishes, fish dishes, desserts, and drinks such as sake and tea. The aroma of the dishes is mellow, and you can tell that the chef of the house has put a lot of thought into them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It will be starting soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina said and left Nozomu and the others to go to Somia's place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noticing her return, Somia said a few words to the classmates she had been talking to and left, jumping into the arms of her beloved sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina also gently accepted Somia as she jumped to her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, with a goddess-like smile on her face, picks up her sister and embraces her with a big smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people around her naturally smiled at this gentle and beautiful scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She smiled and said, "Thank you for celebrating my dear sister's birthday today. I hope you will forget your usual duties and sensitivities today and have a lot of fun" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The party started with Iris Dina's greeting amidst a warm atmosphere, and the participants who gathered at the venue began to enjoy themselves in their own ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, Mars, and Ena decided to start by tasting the food that was on hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This meat is very delicious. If we could serve it in our restaurant, we would offer it at ....... But the cost of the ingredients alone would add up. ...... No, if we could at least recreate the sauce......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's very dedicated, isn't she?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, it's usually Ena who comes up with new dishes for the Ushiro- Tei menu" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Mars also took some of the food she was tasting and tried it while watching Ena play Soroban in her head while analyzing the dishes served to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First  of all, the aroma of the mellow sauce stimulates the nostrils,  and when  you put  it in  your mouth and bite into it, the meat, which has been grilled with some redness, gives you a good bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the oil from the meat that has melted in the mouth mixes with the mellow sauce and becomes a rich umami flavor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's so good......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, honestly, I can't think of another word to describe it" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-230"></a>This  is  the  best  food  they  have  ever  tasted  in  their  lives.  The  two  men,  marveling  at  the deliciousness of the food, took one plate after another and ate them all up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene was not very refined, but since the party itself was originally a small, intimate affair, and the host declared it to be a rude affair, no one was blaming them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, some of the maids and butlers seemed to be piling up the food on the plates they picked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though they originally worked for the Francilt family, they rarely had the opportunity to eat such sumptuous food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, when their eyes meet, they smile at each other and focus once again on the dishes in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, people are gathered around Irisdina, Somia, and Tima, chatting and laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  particular,  Somia  was  surrounded  by  not  only  Ecross's  classmates,  but  also  a  succession  of butlers and maids who serve the mansion, who came to congratulate her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, who had been receiving the congratulations for a while, noticed Nozomu and his friends at the end of the hall and came with her sister to the table where Nozomu and his friends were eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good evening, Nozomu-san" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good evening. Somia-chan. Happy birthday" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehehe, Thank you for coming to my party today!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia replies to Nozomu's congratulations with a big smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia was so happy to celebrate her birthday that her voice was filled with joyful emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm so happy to see you," he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May I ask the names of the people over there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's eyes turn to Mars and Ena, who are standing next to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps startled by the sudden arrival of the guest of honor, both Mars and Ena hurriedly downed the food in their mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ng, ng ....... I'm Mars Dickens" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ng! koho koho .......  It's  nice to  meet  you, Somiliana-sama.  I  am  Mars Dickens' sister and my name is Ena. I was invited by Irisdina-san to attend your today" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, just Somia is fine. This party is not formal one, and I'm more than happy to have it that way!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to meet you, little girl" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-231"></a>"Oy, Onii-chan!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ena-san, I don't mind!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia is as unconcerned as ever about the difference in status, and Mars readily takes her up on her offer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena is furious at her brother's irreverent language, and Somia is in a hurry to get rid of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, a caustic sibling quarrel is about to start three times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey you two, we're in the middle of a party ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, hearing the commotion, rushes over to help Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she, who is not assertive by nature, is fatally lacking in dignity and power to stop this runaway sibling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is not very assertive, but she lacks the dignity and power to stop them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you having fun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, Iris Dina approached Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yes. But don't you have to stop them?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  holding a plate of food in  his  hand, quietly pointed at  Mars and the others  who were causing a ruckus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The actuality is, it's not really a problem for me. From what I saw at the gate, it looks like Mars and his sister are usually like that. And Somia seems to be having fun with that. Tima seems to be having a bit of a hard time, but that's okay once in a while" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked very happy as she watched the hustle and bustle with a giggle and a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked so warm and gentle, so different from the dignified girl at the school, that Nozomu felt his eyes glued to hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there something wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, no, no. It's nothing" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was instantly embarrassed and involuntarily looked away when he realized that he had been admiring the girl next to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looked at Nozomu, who suddenly began to slumber, and then suddenly swooped in. Her gaze was fixed on the small little box held in Nozomu's hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  act,  which  was  unguarded  for  an  aristocratic  daughter,  made  Nozomu's  heart  pound  even faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it a birthday present for Somia?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-232"></a>"Emm, Yes ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you. Somia was looking forward to it, so give it to her later" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu nodded his head, Irisdina's smile also deepened in satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence fell between the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while, they stood at the edge of the hall and watched the party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">" by the way, I haven't thanked you yet" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh,.. for what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For coming to this party. We celebrate Somia's birthday every year, but this year she seems to be especially happy. I'm sure it's because you guys came" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... hmm?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilted his head, unsure of the meaning of Irisdina's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are the daughters of a great noble family. A birthday party for a daughter of a great noble family would normally attract a large number of people, and even though it was only their relatives this time, there were still enough people to make the hall noisy. It seemed that they were not lonely at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia, she looks innocent, but she is a person with delicate senses. She is so sensitive that even at her age, she can detect malicious intent and alienation" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina accepts a glass from a nearby maid and slowly swallows the contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have had my fair share of experience in aristocratic society, but Somia has as good an eye for people's feelings as I do" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Irisdina says, she can easily spot those who approach her for profit or loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My mother gave birth to Somia and died at that time. That's why I've been trying to be Somia's mother. ...... I guess I still miss my own mother. Somia always seemed somewhat sad when her birthday approached" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She then proceeded to talk about her own family in an endless stream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had no idea that their mother had passed away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's  unexpected  confession  made  Nozomu's  eyes  widen,  but  he  listened  intently  to  her monologue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But this time it's not so. I think it was because I met you after all. Somia often talked about you in the mansion. He said he met a strange but kind brother" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So it was ......? But I didn't think It could change so much with just one person......." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-233"></a>"I told you. Somia, she's sensitive to people's malice and separatism. The maids and butlers in the mansion are those who have served us since before we came to Arcazam, but Somia and I can't help but be caught in the middle of their partisanship" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who serve and those who are tutored. It is said that the differences in position between those who serve and those who are served are not easily removed even if it takes a long time to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, because they have served each other for a long time, a clear difference in status is imprinted at the base of their consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  unaware  that  Somia  was  a  high-ranking  noblewoman,  and  Mars  personality  was always like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, at least while we are in this town, I want you to forget about the difference in status and treat Somia as you would treat any other person" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  had  certain  expectations  of  Nozomu  and  the  others  because  she  had  no  preconceived notions about them due to their status differences at first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had thought about changing her attitude several times before, but when her sister begged her to do so, there was no denying it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I...... understand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you. You're very kind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really? I don't think so......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are kind. When other hear about the loss of our mothers, most of them try to cheer up with appropriate words of comfort or meaningless cheerfulness, but you were different" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was simply speechless, you know?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is what's kindness about you. You didn't try to make up for it by using bad words or attitude, but you put yourself in my shoes and thought about me, didn't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was so deep with the way he was feeling that he involuntarily fell silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is really good at reading people's minds. Nozomu was amazed by her insight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are not a cold-blooded person, as they say at the school. Rather, you seem to be an overly kind person. You are still at the school because of your feelings for your childhood friend Lisa-kun, aren't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened when he heard her next words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The rumors that have been spreading in the school are probably groundless, I have no proof, just a hunch" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-234"></a>At the same time, a variety of indescribable feelings welled up in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  childish  fury  at  what  basis  he  was  claiming  innocence,  and  joy  at  the  realization  of  his  own innocence. Anger and sadness from remembering the time when he was denied by the person he cared about most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart was pounding wildly, and his vision narrowed with shaken emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes shook with agitation, and Nozomu awkwardly turned his gaze away from Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're a bit strange......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surprising? I'm a person who relies on my senses a lot" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next thing that remained at the bottom of the gentle ripples was a feeling of joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mouth, which had been frozen in a stupor, now reflected a gentle smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was also smiling with satisfaction at his expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For heaven's sake, that's enough ----!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The guest of honor's loud voice drew Nozomu and Irisdina's attention back to Somia and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia and Tima seemed to be trying to stop Mars and Ena, who were still bickering with each other, with a flurry of attacks, but it seemed to be no use after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, neither Somia's friends nor the maids and butlers of the mansion, who only watched the young girl's struggles with gentle smiles on their faces, made any attempt to touch her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, there may be a separation due to the difference in status. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the expressions on everyone's faces as they watch over Somia shows just how much she is loved in this mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh my God! Ane-sama, Nozomu-san, don't be so ho-hum on the edge, do something!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Irisdina exchanged glances at Somia's voice and shrugged their shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It seems the princess is calling, so let's go now" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, Yeah, I guess I'll stop Mars for now" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two nodded to each other and walked into the bustle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great hall of the party venue was filled with warm air before they knew it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the main gate of the Francilt residence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The night was drawing in, and an old man was standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-235"></a>A maid, who happened to be in the hallway, noticed the old man and went outside the mansion to greet him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man was dressed in a crisp gray butler's uniform, and his demeanor suggested that he was obviously in the service of someone of high rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who is it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour of the night. I'm here to see the master of this house, and I was wondering if you would be so kind as to attend to me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry to inform you that there is a party going on today to celebrate the birthday of the master's sister, so no one will be able to attend to you. I will inform the master of your business after the party, so please refrain" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maid was a little impressed by the old gentleman's very courteous attitude, but at the same time, she was a little skeptical about such a late visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maid inquires about his business, but the old gentleman insists that he must speak in front of the person who has business with him, and will not budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know this is a very late hour, but I was wondering if you could take this call for me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So please tell me what you need to do here" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am very sorry. I am not permitted by contract to discuss my business with a third party" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman repeatedly asks the maid to meet with the master of the house, but the maid continues to refuse him softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it can't be helped..........." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, the old gentleman gave up, let out a sigh, straightened the collar of his butler's uniform, and snapped the fingers of his right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maid's body suddenly lost its strength and collapsed on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very sorry. This is also the command of my lord" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman catches the maid's body as it collapses through the iron bars of the gate, gently leans her body against the door of the main gate, and then runs his fingers through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A light reminiscent of fireflies flutters through the air, forming a shining white magic circle on the path leading from the front gate to the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman nodded his head, looking at the shining magic circle at  his feet, and quietly entered the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-236"></a>† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The party was in full swing, and after calming down Mars and Ena, Nozomu and the others were ready to give Somia the gift they had prepared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia was about to give the gift to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, in case  you're wondering, it's a birthday party, so we've prepared a lot of things for  you too......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and the others let out a wry smile at Somia, whose eyes were sparkling even before she handed over the gift, and who was impatiently asking them to hurry up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that  moment,  however, the door to  the hall where the party was  held  slammed open and an elderly gentleman entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...Huh? Was it someone from this mansion?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An elderly gentleman with silver hair tied back, dressed in a gray butler's uniform, and with one eye in his eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilted his head at the appearance of a man whose appearance he had not seen before at this party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I don't know him either. He is not a member of the Francilt family" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who was watching over Somia beside Nozomu and the others, also frowns as she speaks her doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An old gentleman with red eyes and one eyeglass. In Irisdina's memory, there was no such person in the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attendees who were enjoying the party noticed the unfamiliar old gentleman, and their gazes around the party began to focus on the old gentleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  appearance  of  the  suspicious  old  gentleman  gradually  enveloped  the  venue  in  silence,  and with the silence came a sense of tension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who are you? I think you are not the one I invited to today's party" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, stepping forward, asks the old gentleman in a stiff voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman, on the other hand, when he saw that Irisdina was in sight, put his hand on his chest, stepped back, and returned a splendid bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each gesture, such as the gaze, the position of the shoulders, the hips, and the footsteps. All of them were the most perfect curtsy that even Irisdina, who had lived as a noblewoman, had ever seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-237"></a>"I am truly sorry to have disturbed you with my ill-mannered manners. I am a butler in the service of a nobleman of a certain country, and my name is Rugato. I presume you are Irisdina-sama and Somiliana-sama, the owners of this mansion" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right, I am Irisdina Francilt, the owner of this mansion. Behind me is my sister, Somiliana, what brings you here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had  guessed from  the old butler's  behavior that he actually  served a high-ranking aristocrat, asks again in a condescending tone of voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other party is apparently a messenger of a high ranking nobleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina does not remember allowing this person to enter the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he was obviously trespassers, it was necessary to treat him with appropriate dignity, even to the point of questioning his rudeness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"First  of  all,  why  don't  you  tell  me  the  name  of  the  lord  you  serve?  It  is  a  bit  unreasonable  to welcome a person who suddenly enters a mansion and does not even say the name of his lord" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are absolutely right. If possible, I would like to speak only to Irisdina-sama and Somiliana-sama......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do  you  think  that  a  man  who  suddenly  interrupted  my  sister's  birthday  party  without  my permission, the owner of this mansion, has the right to want to do so?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  is  quite plausible. I am  a servant  of the House of Waziart  family from  Dizard  Empire. This time, I've been entrusted with a message from my lord" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dizard Empire. As I recall, it is located in the northwestern part of the continent,......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mouth spins the name of the country as if mumbling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Dizard Empire is a snowy country surrounded by mountains in the northwestern part of the Arkmill continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The country is exposed to a harsh climate, but its most distinctive feature is that it was founded by seven different tribes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seven tribes that founded the country are all powerful and capable, but at the same time they have a history of being ostracized by other tribes for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nation that these tribes gathered together to create was the Dizard Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of its historical background, it had no diplomatic relations with other countries and never interfered with other countries on its own. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-238"></a>However, the power that it possesses is  powerful,  and during a major invasion  20  years ago, it defeated a large army of demonic beasts that had crossed its borders alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My purpose is to take back the treasure, the Furnace of Sacred Flame, which I previously loaned to the Francilt family" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Furnace of the Spiritual Flame?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina tilts her head at the words she has never heard before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the next head of the Francilt family, Irisdina has a detailed memory of the family history, but she had no idea about the item called the Furnace of Sacred Flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. It is a hidden treasure that takes the souls of others and gives them its own power, and was originally the property of the Waziart family, whom I serve." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's gaze fell on Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From what I have seen ......, it seems that it is now fused with Somiliana-sama's soul. I will ask you to return it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone present could not believe their ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato says that the Furnace of Sacred Flame has fused with Somia's soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, he says he will have that treasure returned to him right here and now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well then, now I will fulfill our contract" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wa-wait!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who did not understand the situation at all, called out to Rugato to restrain him, but he ignored her restraint and ran his fingers through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, a tremendous amount of magical power covered the entire mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magical power filled in the surroundings wraps around Nozomu's body and the other, and a powerful suggestion came over them that they had to leave this room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively raises his qi and resists the oncoming suggestion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quickest way to deal with suggestion magic, such as sleep and hypnosis, is to increase the magic power and qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The increased qi repels Rugato's magical power, and any suggestion that comes to mind is instantly dismissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-239"></a>However,  the  housekeeper,  maids,  and  Somia's  friends,  who  could  not  resist  the  suggestion, walked out of the hall with empty expressions on their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The color of the entire hall changed from white to grayish, and the view from the window seemed to fade as if time had stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What it is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia asked her sister in an anxious voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe it's warding magic. ....... It seems to be the kind of magic that can create a strong suggestion in a person other than the target" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warding magic is one of the formation techniques. By drawing a circle of magic on the ground or at a starting point, the magic has a lasting effect within a certain area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The duration of effect is long, and depending on how it is used, various effects can be obtained over a long period of time, but it is basically a magic that requires time and effort to set up the formation and requires strategic operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the longer the area of effect is extended, the longer it lasts and the less effective it becomes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  warding  seemed  to  cover  the  entire  Francilt  mansion  as  far  as  the  eye  could  see  out  the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars and the others are......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu looked at the others, he saw that Mars and Tima seemed to be able to resist Rugato's warding magic as well as Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Ena, who was unfamiliar with magic, was under the suggestion of the warding magic and went out like the other maids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am very sorry that I suddenly make it roughly, But this is a contract. In order for you to return the treasure, I will take Somia-sama soul" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words  of an elderly gentleman by the name of Rugato  sent  Nozomu  and his  friends into a whirlpool of shock and amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean you're going to take my soul?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia asks Rugato in a trembling voice. The expression on Irisdina's face was as hard as ever, and she was staring at Rugato with a hostility that could shoot through her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia asks Rugato in a trembling voice. The expression on Irisdina's face next to her could not be stiffer, and she glared at him with a hostility that was almost shooting through her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-240"></a>"It is as they say. Three hundred years ago, the then head of the House of Francilt made a secret pact with the House of Waziart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman took a piece of old parchment from his chest and spread it out for Nozomu and the others to see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He was given the assistance of the Waziart family to solve a problem that the Francilt family was facing at the time. One of the magical tools that was given to them as help was a furnace of spiritual flame. And here is the contract that was signed at that time" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The parchment clearly stated that the House of Waziart would assist the House of Francilt, and in exchange for the offer of the magical tools owned by the House of Waziart, the House of Francilt would return the tools after a certain period of time, as well as a huge amount of money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, as a proof of this secret agreement, a pledge ornament was to be made as a seal of the contract, which was to be kept by the Francilt family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It further stated that at the end of the contract period, the messenger of the contract summoned by the ornament would enforce the contract and retrieve the magical tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And that the Francilt family could not protest any damage to the Wajiart family in that case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final touch, the contract is also stamped with the family crest, which only the head of the Francilt family is allowed to use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such as............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane-sama ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Somia open their eyes as the deal is pointed out to be genuine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Since the soul is pulled out at the stage of collecting the magical tools. Somia-sama who is fused will die, but that is also included in the contract. Then, I will complete the contract." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"W-wait! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old letters on the contract began to glow suspiciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, with a thump, the magic pulsating in the contract pulsed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, black magic light seeped out from Somia's arm ornament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, eh, what ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The armlet, which has begun to emit a disturbing light, vibrates in small tics , as if it resonating with the contract that Rugato was holding up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, a black mist erupts from the armlet, and a hooded shadow emerges from the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-241"></a>The figure has a tattered hood and a skeletonized body beneath it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It eyes were glowing with an eerie red light, and in it hand it carried a huge scythe that was taller than the figure was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance was that of a god of death itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is the messenger who is in charge of this contract. It is the guardian of the contract and the custodian of the hidden treasures. Please rest assured. You will not feel any pain or suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, kyaaaa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Rugato declared this, chains suddenly sprang out from under the hood worn by the Grim Reaper and bound Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grim Reaper, carrying a scythe worthy of the name, reaches out it skeletonized hand to Somia, who is now bound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I won't let you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina deployed magic in an instant in front of the Grim Reaper, who was about to extract Somia's soul. Black chains appeared in the air and entangled the messenger of the contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Restraining magic, dark binding chain' </p>
<p class="calibre1">A magic of the dark attribute, which is positioned in the intermediate level of magic. The black chains, which emit a pale light, constrict the body of the Grim Reaper and seal its movements in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The speed of its deployment. Is it an ability that call is immediate deployment ?" </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kMDqcpp/000012.jpg" alt="000012" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-243"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato expresses his admiration for the high-speed magic of Irisdina's ability "Immediate Deployment". </p>
<p class="calibre1">From his point of view, Irisdina's magic boasts an intensity that makes it hard to believe that it is magic constructed only from images. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was not enough to catch the reaper. Every time the messenger flinched, the chains that restrained it creaked with a creaking sound, and countless cracks began to appear on the rings of the chains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who has decided that it is difficult to restrain the Reaper for a long time with her magic, pulls out the thin sword at her waist and slashes at the messenger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, before Irisdina's blade could catch her, the Reaper destroyed the chains that restrained her and intercepted her slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The physical strength of the Reaper was stronger than expected, and Irisdina's body was thrown off in a big way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gugu, Tima!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Un!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grim Reaper who had flung away Irisdina tries to slash at Somia again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Tima, who had finished her chanting while Irisdina bought time, blocked the Reaper with a more powerful binding magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four independent magic circles were deployed around the Grim Reaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The binding formation-four-scale barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four magic circles of red, blue, green, and yellow formed a larger circle with each of them at the top, and restraint the Grim Reaper in the center of the circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it is a wonderful magic, each attribute circulating without repulsion, forming a stronger binding. I have lived a long time, and I have not seen anyone who can use magic like this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic deployed by Tima may have tugged at Rugato's heartstrings, and he clapped his hands with crackling praise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Also Irisdina-sama's magic is wonderful. The effects of immedietly deployment magic can easily drop off depending on how focused you are, but to be able to restrain the messenger, even if only temporarily, that is ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-244"></a>The old gentleman's praise was also directed at Irisdina, who had stalled for time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But no matter how much you try to stop the messenger, it won't be a solution" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intense magical power welled up from Rugato. He judged Irisdina and Tima to be obstacles to the enforcement of the contract and began to eliminate them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato reached out with his left hand and drew a circle in the air with his index finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a magic bullet was released from the drawn magic circle and hit Tima's shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Kyaaa!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact on her shoulder caused her uniform to tear and blood to fly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sudden pain then began to spread from her shoulder to the rest of her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima almost collapses from the pain and shock, but manages to hold her ground and continue to maintain her magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The grim reaper who is restraining glares at Tima who is the one use  that magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sshhh......!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">The inorganic gaze from the Reaper and the hostility directed at her from Rugato chipped away at her feeble spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But despite the pain and fear shaking her body, she never attempted to break the magic binding the Reaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biting her lip, she concentrated her mind solely on maintaining the magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Scary, i'm scared ....... But if I turn off the magic, Somia-chan's life will be in danger!) She is the sister of a dear friend and her most dear friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awakened to more magic than she could bear at an early age and at the mercy of uncontrollable forces, she found herself growing up with a dark and withdrawn personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This did not change when she came to Arcazam and joined Ecross. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her magical powers were clearly out of step with those of the truly gifted on the continent. In addition, she had an extremely high aptitude for the four attributes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four-scale symphony. The ability that gave rise to her two names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, even in Ecross, she is isolated and her reclusive nature becomes worse and worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Somia were the first friends and family she made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She still remembers them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She still remembers the way Irisdina spoke to her when she was isolated at Solminati Academy, and her dark nature combined with her classmates made her more and more distant from them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-245"></a>"Hi, nice to meet you. Can I have a word?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiya, hi!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's a simple, ordinary, easy-going greeting. But to her, who was hungry for a connection with other people, these were the words she had been waiting for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They began to talk little by little and soon became friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the process of getting to know each other, she also met Somia, and being attracted to the two people who were different from her dark-nature self, and being guided by them, her world gradually regained its light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For her, Irisdina was the brightest star in the night sky and Somia the sun that dispelled the dark night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you still working hard? Not only Your magic power is considerable, but you seem to have a lot of mental strength" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to the two of them, the lonely girl was no longer alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that you can't be alone in your life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While witnessing Tima's healthy and brave resistance, Rugato deployed his magic circle without hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The five fingers of Rugato's left hand draw in the air and deploy five magic circles at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I won't let you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina slashes at Rugato, but the old gentleman deploys four magic circles with his free right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From two of the four magic circles, blood-red swords are produced and shot out at Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina flashes her beloved sword, the silver wing of the Evening Star, and repels the oncoming blood-coloured sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blood-coloured sword that was repelled flips around in mid-air and rushes towards Irisdina once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword flying through the air repeatedly attacks Irisdina and blocks her even after being repelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A closer look reveals that two of the four magic circles deployed in her left hand are still in place, and the fingers attached to them are moving intricately. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-246"></a>Apparently, Rugato is using yet another magic to control the sword he created with his magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The difficulty of magic jumps exponentially as the power, type and number of magic deployed increases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima felt a cold sweat running down her spine at Rugato's skill at manipulating several different types of magic simultaneously and at will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Tima was stiffening in anticipation of Rugato's skill, five magic bullets formed from the magic circle deployed in the old gentleman's right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato cut the sky with his index finger and the magic bullets generated gathered into one mass and became a huge light bullet that attacked Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, who is maintaining an extremely high level of restraint magic, is unable to move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked stunned in the face of the oncoming light projectile, followed by a frustrated bite of her lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a deadly attack that she could not dodge. Still, Tima stares at the light bullet, determined to withstand it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the magic did not pierce her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just before Rugato's magic bullet caught her body, a shadow intervened and obliterated the light bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars found himself intervening between Rugato and Tima, punching away the magic bullet that was about to hit her with his qi-infused fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars......-kun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima muttered his name with a dazed look on her face, as if she was surprised that Mars had come to her aid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her voice at his back, Mars was asking himself Why did i protect her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they first met, he didn't like Tima's attitude of looking at the other person's face while being ostentatious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of her, who had no energy to talk back to the man who had been rude to her despite her A rank, irritated Mars just as much as Nozomu used to. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-247"></a>However, the strong desire to "not give up!" was evident on her face as she struggled to protect Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  face  of  this  determined  expression,  Mars  unintentionally  intervened  between  Tima  and Rugato, and shook his fist at the magic bullet approaching her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a stupid thing. You should concentrate on your magic. I'll take care of that old man's magic." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars does not turn to her, but slowly holds his fist in the air while glaring at Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he sends qi into his clenched fist, the qi contained in it swirls around, gradually increasing its momentum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind produced eventually transforms into a clearly visible wind mass, which entangles both of Mars' arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu: Wind-Mass Palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind is compressed into a mass of wind, which is then wrapped around the fist, increasing the force of the blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Y-......... Yes, please!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the best out of your opponent is to be the best you can be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oi, Nozomu, go bring back our swords" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  and  Mars  left  the  swords  they  were  carrying  with  the  maids  when  they  entered  the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know where it's kept, but the key is......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, take this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina throws the master key to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Nozomu and Mars have no weapons of their own at the moment. And their opponent is a monster who can easily deploy multiple spells simultaneously. It is clear that Irisdina and Tima alone are too much for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay. Please, for a while!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars exhales heavily as he watches Nozomu run out of the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a new person, you will be surprised at how much you can learn about them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No matter how you look at, that old man is better than us, isn't he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-248"></a>"Yeah, he's definitely an S-rank, in the same class as Jihad-Sensei" </p>
<p class="calibre1">S-rank. That is the title of a strong man, and there are only a few dozen of them on the Arkmill continent. The most important thing to remember is that they are talented person who is said to be able to deal with 100 people alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars's  feelings  were  inevitably  overwhelmed  in  front  of  the  strong  oldman  who  was  so  eye-catching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you going to do with ............?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That messenger is summoned by the contract that Rugato-shi has. That means......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We need to do something about the contract that old strong fucker is holding so dearly, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Mars's words, Irisdina nods a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How about just kill that grim reaper?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If the main source of the summons is the existence of that contract, then it's unlikely the contract can be broken. Besides, I don't think that old man would give us that kind of chance" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato at the same time is a non-standard being who can manipulate ten different kinds of magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the way he deploys his magic, it is not hard to imagine that he can manipulate as many magics as the number of fingers on each hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A long-range attack with magic and qi-jutsu of the current level of Mars and Irisdina would have little effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only way to find a way out is close combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But it's not easy to get close." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, the number of moves is too different" </p>
<p class="calibre1">So far, the only magic Rugato has used is elementary magic that just shoots out magic bullets, and magic that creates a fresh-blood-coloured sword and manipulates it from a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He may use multiple fingers when using higher-level magic, but even so, the number of moves is too different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even so, I'll win. Mars-kun, you take care of Tima" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars also nodded to the inspiring declaration of Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other party is undoubtedly one of the highest-ranking people on this continent. Even so, they have no intention of losing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding to each other, Mars and Irisdina glared at Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-249"></a>Rugato,  while  facing  the  wariness  of  the  two  person  head-on,  spreads  his  hands  out  like  an orchestra conductor in a relaxed gesture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A silent provocation: 'Come at me'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  if  in  response  to  this  provocation,  Mars  and  Irisdina  ran  to  the  ground  to  respond  to  the provocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having retrieved the weapons from storage, Nozomu was running down the corridor to return to Irisdina and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Rugato-san is probably the same rank as Shisho ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">While moving his feet single-mindedly, Nozomu calmly guessed the power of Rugato, who had attacked them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman's expression did not change even when he was facing Irisdina, Mars and the others, and the image of his master was recalled in Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic  and  swords.  Although  the  direction  was  different,  Rugato,  like  Shino,  exuded  a  strange atmosphere emanating from a strong person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And that atmosphere, at the same time, made Nozomu feel certain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Irisdina and the others can't win ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A conviction that can only be felt because they have been beside the strongest of all and fought for their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">And moreover, the girls now have to suppress the messenger demon that Rugato is following as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I have to hurry. But can we beat him? Without me using 'that power' ......) The first thing that came to Nozomu's mind in order to win against Rugato. It was to release his Ability Supression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the fear that had been nestled in Nozomu's mind created hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He can see in his mind's eye a future where he will be frightened by the power he has released, people looked at him with fear and they rejected him. A barren future where he will be all alone being seen as a monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he has always been in denial state, Nozomu's thoughts tend to lean in a negative direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-250"></a>The sight that came to mind made his heart sag, and his body trembled with fear of falling into loneliness again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it, damn it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shouted at the weakness in his heart that made him try to run away immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is because he has regained the warmth of people that he feel disgusted with himself who is still hesitant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The self that wants to escape and the frustration of possibly losing that warmth again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While being caught between the two sides, Nozomu could only speed up his steps to cover up his anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars continues to repel the oncoming storm of magic bullets with his fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato showered Tima with magic bullets without mercy, but Mars, who had intervened between them, acted as a shield and continued to block Rugato's magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh! Aaahh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, no matter how much you strengthen with your qi, it is not easy to repel magic bullets with your bare hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, even though it was beginner-level magic, it was the magic of an S-ranked power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's magic penetrates through Mars' qi-jutsu attached to his fist, tearing the skin of his hand to shreds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His fist is already covered in blood and some white bone is visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, he swings his fist. Each time he does, blood splatters on the floor, making the white marble floor bloom with blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaahhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was similarly outpowered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she was not as visibly wounded as Mars, she was not able to get close at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fresh blood-coloured sword that had been produced again was flying in the air, blocking her rush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if she releases magic with immediate deployment, Rugato responds immediately and quickly builds a formation with multiple fingers. He launches magic as fast as or faster than her and cancels it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa, haa, haa......." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-251"></a>"Kuuh...... Mars-kun. Are you alright ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ha ha ...... shut up, concentrate on maintaining your magic instead of me" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima called out to Mars in a concerned voice,  but her complexion is so pale that she is about to collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I can't do it, It takes a lot of magical power and concentration to sustain such a high level of magic) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's magic is extremely advanced magic that uses all four attributes simultaneously. It requires an enormous amount of magical and mental power to activate and maintain that magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, her body has already been hit several times by Rugato's magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima herself is not a hard-hit person, and the wounds she sustained hurt her, slowly but surely eroding her concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them were resisting desperately, but they were beginning to be pushed by the incessantly pounding magic and finally reached their limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them were unable to handle the oncoming magic bullets, and when Mars's stance collapsed, a follow-up magic bullet struck her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaaaahhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a scream, Mars's body is flung off and slammed against the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's over, isn't it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"tsk!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars is hit, there is no one left to block Rugato's magic, and multiple magic bullets are shot into Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kyaaaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no way for her to avoid them, and the magic bullets hit her directly. She collapsed to the floor as if in a heap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the 'Four-scale Binding' that restrained the messenger is released, and the Grim Reaper is unleashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima! Mars-kun!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina shouted, but neither of them could move and could only grunt and groan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina tries to run to Somia to stop the Grim Reaper, but she is stopped in her tracks by a magic bullet that passes in front of her at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-252"></a>Rugato, who succesfully restrained Irisdina rush, fired a magic bullet with his free left hand and started pursuing further while controlling the blood sword with his right hand and launched a further pursuit. Irisdina is completely stuck in a dense attack that is incomparable to the previous one.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The death messenger stops right in front of Somia and raises his scythe. There was no longer anyone who could stop this messenger of death, and Somia's death was certain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ah......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elder sister desperately calls out her sister's name, while the younger sister is engulfed by the fear of death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fate of two sisters was now fixed ............ and it should have been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flash of light rushes out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scythe that the Grim Reaper was about to swing down is cut off by both of its arms and flies through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Eh" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thoughts of everyone present stop, and for a moment, the feeling that time has stagnated dominates the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A single shadow was sprinting through that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a snap, the curved sword that had been drawn is sheathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shadow quickly lunged at the reaper, he began to open cut the mouthpiece of the sword on his waist, sparkled the blade, and fired a deadly blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu - Phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A slash sharpened to the extreme cuts the body of the Grim Reaper in two and shatters the arm ornament that was the core of the Reaper's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Reaper, whose nucleus had been destroyed, vanished like mist, and fragments of the shattered arm ornament danced in the surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu ......-san?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia murmurs Nozomu's name as if to confirm it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl was fascinated by his large back, which was different from her sister's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu does not answer Somia's question, but faces Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-253"></a>(Shisho. What should I ...... do ............) There would never an answer to his own anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of her loved ones who were being hurt in front of her, Somiliana was just frustrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima and Mars are full of wounds trying to help themselves who can't do anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her sister is still able to fight, but her beautiful body is covered with several wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring her sister, an incarnation of death lands in front of her to reap Somia's soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her body trembles and her throat can't even scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fear clung to her, along with the chains of the Reaper that bound her body, and the icy coldness of her body deprived her of all freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grim Reaper swung down his scythe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia closes her eyes tightly, as if to escape the pain that would strike her with instant death. It was as if she was running away from reality by meditating. It was all she could do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how long it took, the pain never came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she opened her eyes, she saw not the Grim Reaper, but the back of a man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The back that can never be said to be big. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to her at that moment, that back seemed bigger and more dependable than anything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had slashed through the messenger of the contract, received the stunned voice of Somia at his back, but did not look back, silently keeping a wary eye on Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opponent he is confronting now cannot be allowed to let his guard down in the slightest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Rugato, seeing Nozomu cut down the contracted messenger with a single sword, looks as if he cannot believe his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My Goodness, I didn't expect the contracted messenger demon to be defeated with only two slash </p>
<p class="calibre1">......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  and  Tima  both  had  stiffened  expressions,  and  Mars  let  out  a  dry  laugh  as  if  he  were dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu lowers the great sword on his back to the floor and kicks it towards Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-254"></a>While sliding on the floor, he picked up the big sword that came beside him, and Mars leaked a word similar to a bittersweet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn ............ you're late ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking  up  the  greatsword  with  blood-soaked  hands,  Mars  manages  to  stand  up  using  it  as  a walking stick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, his legs quivered, and even from the side, it seemed impossible to continue the battle.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... sorry" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But I defeated the messenger of the contract. Now Somia-chan is ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The messenger who fulfilled the contract was defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, apart from Nozomu's relief, the nuclei of the messenger demons he shattered fly up into the air and gradually begin to gather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fragments gathered in the air turned jet-black and once again became a mass of black light, which began to pulse with a thumping sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was clearly a sign that the familiar of the contract was resurrected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"W-why.... But how.....?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The messenger is just to fulfill the contract. As long as I have the contract, it will be resurrected as many times as I want. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grimly, biting his back teeth, Nozomu glares at Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Do you really intend to take Somia-chan's soul with you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course. Otherwise, I will not be able to fulfil my main mission" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato answers immediately without hesitation. He has no doubts about what he is trying to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's voice naturally becomes rough due to that attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why, that ridicilous! These people have no knowledge of a contract that is three hundred years old! Do you think such a contract can be accepted? In the first place, the only content of the contract is to return the Furnace of Spiritual Flame! You never said anything about taking Somia-chan's soul with you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has no idea about the duties of a noble house or the situation of the Francilt family three hundred years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he could not accept the idea of unilaterally sacrificing Somia, whom she knew nothing about, and throwing it all on their successor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-255"></a>"Honestly, I was not aware that the furnace of spiritual fire had fused with Somiliana-sama's soul until I confirmed it right here and now. My Lord does not think this contract itself is that important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or should I say, I am myself not interested in it......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If so, then......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But the contract has already been signed. Once made, it is absolute" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato does not wait for Nozomu's words and cuts them off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The furnace of the spirit flame has fused with Somiliana-sama's soul and will no longer be able to be detached. But that does not mean that our contract never existed" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unilaterally  breaking  a  contract  that  has  once  been  made  would  be  a  major  blow  to  trust  and dignity, and open the door to being taken advantage of by unscrupulous people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Francilt family has great authority and power, so when such a scandal becomes public, the repercussions are immeasurable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even though he has no interest in it, my Lord will not keep quiet if the contract is unilaterally violated. It is likely that the Francilt family would also not want this secret agreement to become public......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care about that! Let go of Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato put a threat in his polite words, but Irisdina brushed it off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, if the matter became public, the dignity of the Francilt family would fall to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the most important thing for Irisdina is her sister, who is about to be killed in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the Francilt family is not pure and innocent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the next head of the family, Irisdina is aware of this fact, which is why Somia's existence is a treasure that cannot be replaced by anything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Irisdina's declaration, Rugato's mood changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  gentlemanly  expression  remains  unchanged,  but  a spine-tingling wariness  begins  to  radiate from his lean frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack and defence up to now had only been a prelude for Rugato, and he had only felt like he was admonishing a child who was not listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But here, in the face of the clear counter-motivation shown by the next head of the contracting party, he was finally about to get serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing Rugato, who has become more intimidating, Nozomu also holds up his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-256"></a>"...... Nozomu-kun. How many times do you think you can use that technique you just used?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who stands next to Nozomu, also asks Nozomu in a small voice, holding a sword in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is also one of the person who saw Nozomu's phantom killing power with her own eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was surprising that it was so powerful, but now she could rely on its killing power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... not too many. Only a few more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  qi  quantity  under  ability  suppression  is  low.  No  matter  how  much  he  cut  down  the amount of qi he used, he would not be able to unleash a technique that would work on that opponent so many times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but I'm no match for the old man on my own. I need  your assistance to destroy the contract he holds" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Mars and Tima are already in a difficult position to continue fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why Irisdina needed Nozomu's help to save her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"....... understand. I'll go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gave a small nod in response to Irisdina's please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, his voice trembled slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other party is a strong person equivalent to S rank, the same as Shino. It is outrageous to fight with hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(For now, I will fight. Because I have no choice but to fight!) Nozomu, forcibly suppressing his own hesitation by using his current situation as an excuse, puts on his qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina also raised her slender sword, her own magical power rising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am not sure what to do. If so, I have no choice" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's body overflowed with an unusual amount of magical power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic that erupted from the old gentleman's body covered the entire hall, raging so wildly that it threatened to crush Irisdina and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Expensive furnishings and tables fly through the air, and the wallpaper peels off like it has been sanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In our country, strength is  valued above all else. Therefore, the outcome  of a  battle cannot  be overturned, not even by our emperor" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-257"></a>In the Dizard Empire, the stronger you are, the more you are respected and honored, for the reason that the Empire was founded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dueling is considered more sacred than in any other country, and all kinds of duels have been used to settle mutual interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you cannot accept this contract, then go to me...... and prove yourselves stronger than I am!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Rugato told them, if you want to get everything, you must break this contract by force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will come" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, Nozomu launched his flash step. He rushed forward to close the gap between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's  fingers  ran  through  the  air  as  if  playing  a  musical  instrument,  and  he  again  drew  a formation in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were ten magic circles drawn in the air. The magic bullets produced from each magic circle are shot simultaneously toward Nozomu under Rugato's command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ten magic bullets are approaching to pierce Nozomu's body. However, five black magic bullets flying from behind Nozomu intercepted Rugato's magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an attack magic by Irisdina immediate deployment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  black  magic  bullet  crushed  the  first  half  of  the  ten  magic  bullets  that  were  closing  in  on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the remaining five magic bullets were closing in on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu plunged into Rugato, he linked all the muscles in his body and brought the momentum of his attempt to go straight under his control completely by shifting his weight precisely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flash step - Curved style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu runs through the space between the five magic bullets and closes in on Rugato. He then raised his sword, which he had resting on his hip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sei!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato  quickly  drew  a  magic  circle  and  formed  a  single  blood  sword.  With  his  right  hand,  he pulled the sword out of the magic circle and interrupted Nozomu's sword swing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giiinnn! A high-pitched metallic sound echoed through the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  though  the  first  move  is  blocked,  Nozomu  does  not  panic  and  connects  with  a  series  of strikes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-258"></a>Use the muscles of the whole body without waste, connect the movements without stagnation, and continue to drive his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, in response to Nozomu's continuous attack, Rugato, on the other hand, swiftly swung his blood sword in one hand and prevent all of Nozomu's attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to Nozomu's curvy and rapid sword fights, Rugato's defense is linear and powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu felt a strange sense of discomfort at every edge of his robust defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This person has uneven movements. Then!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sword swung down in an exaggerated manner. The moment it was blocked by Rugato's blood sword, Nozomu tightened his armpits, turned his wrists and dropped to his waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the trajectory of the sword that was being swung around suddenly changed. The sword slash of turned into different way as if it slipped through the blood sword, and attacked Rugato from the opposite direction.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tsk!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato returns the blood sword raised at high speed and repels Nozomu's reverse slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman's physical abilities seem to be quite superior to his appearance, and a strong impact was felt on both of Nozomu's arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this  attack and defence made sense to  Nozomu.  In terms  of pure swordsmanship, he knew he was superior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu attacked Rugato with even more diverse swordsmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a wonderful sword technique. I don't think I've mastered such a technique at your age ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, who has extraordinary physical ability, does not mind the difference in skill between him and Nozomu, even though he is admiring his sword technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  even  assumed  that  he  himself  would  be  tossed  around,  and  furthermore  used  body strengthening magic with his left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By raising his own physical abilities even further, he bridges the gap in swordsmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the result of overwhelming experience and precise and accurate magical skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's face contorted at the fact that he could not attack, despite being at a distance where his opponent was not good at. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-259"></a>Rugato drew a further formation with his left hand, which was not holding a sword. Suddenly, a magic circle identical to the one Rugato had drawn appeared at Nozomu's feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the magic circle that appeared at his feet, Nozomu quickly breaks away with his legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment Nozomu broke away, dark-coloured flames erupted from the magic circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he had stayed where he was, he would have been burned to the bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, how versatile is your magic!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the gap widened, Rugato threw down the blood sword in his hand and began to fire magic bullets towards Nozomu again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  tries  to  deflect  the trajectory of the approaching magic bullets  by  striking the sides of them, but he is soon jittery in the face of the storm of magic bullets that break through even Mars' </p>
<p class="calibre1">qi jutsu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unavoidably,  he  activates  Flash  step  -  curved  style.  While  balancing  evasion  and  defence,  he manages to continue to outrun the storm of magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"he avoids them well. You have good eyesight and a good instinct. When it comes to the sword, even I am amazed. However, your qi-jutsu doesn't seem to be very efficient" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  his  unexpected  words  of  praise,  Rugato  sees  through  Nozomu's  weakness  under  the influence of ability suppression and tries to unleash a relentless follow-up magic bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Iwon't let you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Muh....." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, before Rugato could unleash a follow-up attack, Irisdina had closed the gap from the opposite direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silver wings of the Evening Star, the thin sword in Irisdina's hand, shimmered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato dexterously kicked up the blood sword that had been thrown away at his feet, blocking Irisdina's slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina wields a sword in a row while raising her spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her movements are fluid and without any waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of the thin sword is covered with a faint light, as if by strengthening magic, and every time Rugato uses the blood sword, magical elements and sparks are scattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-260"></a>When Nozomu confirms that Irisdina and Rugato are slashing each other, he puts in the sword he had pulled out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then immediately sends qi to the blade of his sword, and in just half a second, the sword is in extreme compression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, who had been slashing with Irisdina, noticed Nozomu's special aura and deployed a magic circle with his free left hand. In half a second, he deployed a double magic barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu drawing his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The extremely compressed qi-blade flew at high speed and landed on the magic circle deployed by Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The qi-blade easily cuts through the first barrier and explodes in the middle of the second barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barrier fades away, fatally destroying the structure of the technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  slashes  at  Rugato  with  his  sword  in  return,  cutting  through  the  scattering  magical elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade was naturally re-attached with extremely compressed qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's left hand moves quickly, and the magic circle that has been constructed forms a blood sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He then sent an enormous amount of magic power into the blood sword to catch Nozomu's qi-compressed blade of sword, which easily slices even rocks in two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuooo" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them clash with each other as if they are sandwiching Rugato between them from both sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even though the opponent is one-handed, Nozomu and Irisdina are unable to push through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of strength do you have, damn old man!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there such a ...... difference like this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu and Irisd </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-261"></a>ina were momentarily intimidated by the difference in strength between them and their opponents, Rugato turned his body around and threw them away with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato let go of the blood sword and immediately formed a formation with both hands. He then hurls countless magic bullets at the two person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Irisdina managed to deal with the storm of magic bullets that rained down on them, but they were gradually released to the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had no choice but to go backwards to clear the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, too, stopped his magical pursuit, as if to take a break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahahaha...... Irisdina-san, how much more can you attack at full force? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fuh ha ha. ......well, I guess one more would be my limit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me too......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The consumption of Nozomu's qi is intense, and he only has one more time to release the phantom blade from his sword. He has the horrible effect of ability supression, and his qi exhausted because he always uses qijutsu with full power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, too, has been fighting with all her might, and she too is deeply fatigued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With no more energy left, they had to make a decision with one last blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The question was how to get through the rain of magic bullets and get into a close combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has a thought in his mind and glances at Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina is so perceptive that Nozomu thinks she might have mind-reading skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, he thought that she would be able to guess his thoughts to some extent just by looking at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Irisdina looks into Nozomu's eyes and is surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The look on her face convinced Nozomu that she had guessed as much as he expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll go,......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...........I understand" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina nodded firmly, despite her extreme nervousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next step is to make a bet of some sort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as they concerned, It's a very bad bet that two people who have no experience in teaming up, predict the strength and behavior of their partner and Rugato, and bet on the expected value derived from their own guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is not possible for confirm their actions aloud, even if it is in a whisper. It is possible that that old man could read actions from a small moving lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-262"></a>"...... Hah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  silent  confirmation,  Nozomu  launched  his  full  power  flash  step  and  plunged  toward Rugato at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately, Rugato's magic bullets came at him in a swarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who was standing behind him, immediately deployed her magic to intercept them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the number of magic bullets was too many to handle, and Nozomu was repeatedly hit by bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tsk! Guh" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spot where he was hit was in extreme pain, and blood gushed out, but Nozomu bit down on the pain and moved his foot forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, a suicide attack is............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato frowns at Nozomu's willingness to take a bullet rather than delicately evade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From Rugato's point of view, it was Nozomu who had the potential to break through his defenses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, this old gentleman with a long history of warfare is also aware of the clear handicap that Nozomu has. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu swordsmanship and qi control are superb. However, contrary to his exquisite qi-jutsu, he is too inefficient in strengthening his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know why, but it is impossible for you to break through by force" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same one-sided development as before, but Nozomu and his team had already anticipated this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina creates a dark-colored spear in her right hand while continuing to shoot magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is an intermediate magic called "Abyss Spear" that imitates a throwing spear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuh~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an excessive load on her brain, Irisdina created a huge spear as tall as she was and threw it at Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dark-colored  spear  flew  at  high  speed  and  fly  into  a  swarm  of  magic  bullets  released  by Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While sprinkling a strong blast around, it blows off Rugato's magic bullets at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The storm of magic bullets subsided temporarily, but not enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-263"></a>Even though he was reaping the storm of magic bullets he had released, Rugato calmly constructed a magic circle again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What he constructed was a formation that produced a double magic barrier and a formation that generated magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took him only two seconds to create a magic circle that was both offensive and defensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I was going to bet on him, I should have waited at least three more seconds. They don't seem to be working together as well as I thought they would." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato calmly tells of Irisdina's blunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was clear from the earlier attack that Nozomu's un-compressed slash would not be enough to break through his defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Rugato's expression changed to one of astonishment when he saw what was beyond the clearing of the billowing smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What caught his eye was the image of Nozomu raising his left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left hand, injected with a large amount of qi, emitted an intense light, illuminating the battered and ruined hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Rugato's  eyes  widened, Nozomu  slammed  his  left  hand, which was infused with  a large amount of qi, onto the marble floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu - Annilihation Light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, the floor beneath Rugato's feet burst open, and a torrent of light enveloped the old gentleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuuuuu!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sudden consumption of large qi hits Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Color fades from his vision, and his eyes grow dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt his own vital activity dropping rapidly due to the release of qi beyond its limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Definitely  a  dangerous  situation.  But  other  than  this,  Nozomu  had  no  other  technique  to  catch Rugato by surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rapid consumption of qi is a bottleneck, but Annilihation Light has the greatest range of effect and the greatest power of annihilation of any of Nozomu's techniques. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Rugato was caught in the middle of this, he would have no choice but to defend himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, this was also his final move. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-264"></a>Even the extremely deadly phantom blade could not break through Rugato's defenses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  however,  Nozomu  realized  that  the  person  Rugato  was  most  wary  of  was himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato  is  an  extremely  powerful  magic-warrior  who  can  deploy  a  wide  variety  of  magic simultaneously and also possesses superior physical abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Futhermore his fighting style is very similar to that of the all-around genius Irisdina. If we compare the number of simultaneous magic deployments, deployment speed, and power, Rugato is clearly superior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Rugato is not that wary of Irisdina, but is more wary of the one-point breakthrough type like Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(That is why Irisdina will be the decisive factor in the end) That's why Irisdina was already preparing her final move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She deployed her magic in succession while raising her beloved sword, the "Silver Wings of the Evening Star," in front of her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Layers  of  black  magic  continue  to  overlap  the  blade,  and  black  magic  light  begins  to  ripple violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By repeatedly applying reinforcing magic, the final result is explosive power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is her decisive move, which she had previously shown in a mock battle at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, she slashed away the torrent of flames released by Lisa with a single sword stroke, but Irisdina poured in even greater amounts of magical power than at that time and piled on the strengthening magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">If she had done it in the chanting form, the action would have definitely taken several minutes, and in the case of the formation form, it would have taken hours to prepare the magic circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Irisdina,  who  has  the  ability  of  immediate  deployment,  repeatedly  activates  the reinforcement magic at a speed more than ten times faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, a magic sword was created in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-265"></a>The magic sword - Lunar Eclipse Night </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magical power enveloping the blade emits a wave of darkness reminiscent of a dim abyss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of the thin sword itself, however, glowed white and held a sparkle like a comet that cut through the dark night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaahhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina steps toward Rugato with her waving spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu cancels his Annihilation Light in time along with her screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, with a full-bodied, powerful swing, the comet, shrouded in darkness, sliced through the remnants of the torrent of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, what escaped from  Irisdina's mouth was not the conviction of victory, but a voice of bewilderment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato was not in the space she had sliced through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wh-where is he...... kyaa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina hurriedly looked around, but a magic bullet approaching from a blind spot lands and she blown away greatly. The silver wing of the evening star in her hand also lost the light of the magic it was holding and rolled on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition,  four magical formations  were deployed around her  as  she fell to  the floor, and the chains summoned from the formations restrained Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world is ...... gua!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is confused by the unexpected situation, but the same magic circle that restrained Irisdina is also deployed around him, and he is restrained in the same way as she is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confused, Nozomu looks around and sees several black shadows flying around him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, he sees that they are a group of bats with black skin and red eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flying bats eventually gathered in one place, and Rugato emerged from the mass of bats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before he was swallowed up by the Annihilation Light, he transformed himself into a bat to get out of the range of Nozomu's qijutsu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took advantage of the gap in the big move to restrain Nozomu and Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that Rugato can turn himself into a bat brings to mind the name of a race in Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Vampires............." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-266"></a>"Yes, that is correct." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vampires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of this race is said to have top class potential among the various races that exist on the continent of Arkmill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Extraordinary  physical  ability,  enormous  magical  power,  extremely  long  life,  various  different abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ability  to  turn  oneself  into  a  bat,  which  Rugato  showed  earlier,  is  also  a  unique  ability  of vampires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vampires have not been seen in the world for several hundred years, but legends of their existence remain throughout the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is said that in one night, they turned all the people in a town into monsters. They are said to have seduced the royalty of a country and destroyed it with their ability to charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are one of the most powerful and dangerous races in the vast continent of Arkmill, which is home to many species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they are feared and persecuted for their abilities and physical defects that require them to drink the blood of others in order to survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's Mithril Sword, isn't it? If I had been pierced through the heart by Irisdina-sama's magic sword, even I would not have survived the attack" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato monologued as he picked up Irisdina's sword, which was lying on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mithril, when fully charged with magic power, exerts a powerful purification ability. It was used as a sacred metal in ancient rituals, and it has the effect of being a special attack on certain races such as vampires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu once again checked Rugato's appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His crimson eyes were certainly one of the characteristics of a vampire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even if he had realized Rugato's true identity now, it would be too late for him to do anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of Nozomu and the others were already either detained or forced into incapacity, and there was nothing they could do now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  Nozomu  and  the  others  helpless,  Rugato  threw  Irisdina's  thin  sword  out  the  window  and headed to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it, get it off, let me go!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-267"></a>While Rugato was moving step by step toward Somia, Irisdina was desperately struggling to break the magic that restrained her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Rugato's restraining magic held her body in place so tightly that the chains that were wrapped around her did not even twitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was desperately struggling to break free of the magic restraining her as Rugato moved step by step toward Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Rugato's  restraining  magic  held  her  body  firmly  in  place,  and  the  chains  that  were wrapped around her did not budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  tried  to  use  magic  to  break  the  restraints  more  even  by  force,  but  even  as  she  tried  to increase her magical power, her magical power dissipated in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, this restraining magic has the effect of suppressing the magical power of the captured opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  moment,  the  black  ball  that  was  in  gestation  in  front  of  Somia  bursts  open,  and  the messenger of the contract revives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's face was tinged with despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No...... Stop, don't do it ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What will happen now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A glimpse of the definite future in the revived grim reaper, Irisdina let out a pleading voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop! Stop! If you want a soul, take my soul!  So please don't take Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She continues to raise her grief-stricken voice, but the messenger of the covenant does not seem to stop at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grim Reaper turns his bleached palm toward Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Somia's  body that was  being restrained is  jerks! Shivering, the light  disappears from her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, a pale ball of light slowly emerged from Somia's chest, which drooped down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ball of light is connected to Somia's body by a thin tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps that ball of light is Somia's soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-268"></a>In fact, Somia's complexion, from which her soul had been extracted, was already as lifeless as that of a dead person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No ...... stop it............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While shedding tears, Irisdina tries to reach out to her younger sister, who has a pale face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia was her most important treasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  able  to  become  the  next  head  of  the  Francilt  family  and  not  lose  sight  of  herself  in  a society of aristocrats swirling with desires, all because of her little sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina lost her mother when she was very young. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Somia that her mother, who was originally weak, gave birth in exchange for her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Irisdina is going to be a big sister now, so please take care of her" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The day before she died, while patting her big belly and her head, her mother made a request to Irisdina. A somewhat sad smile appeared on her emaciated face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, as if in exchange for her mother's life, Somia was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was a premature baby, much smaller than a normal baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, her newborn sister cried hard and tried to live with her tiny body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Irisdina made up her mind. In place of her deceased mother, she would protect her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The memories of Somia's life since her birth flashed through her mind like a running light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had been a loving little sister who had followed behind her with a smile, saying "ane-sama, ane-sama, ane-sama". They spent time together, day and night, talking about the cuteness of dogs and cats, forgetting about the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now her irreplaceable existence is about to be lost forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grim Reaper raises his scythe to sever the thin tail that connects Somia's soul to her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina can only simply pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I  don't  care  who  you  are,  I  will  do  whatever  I  can  do.  I'm  willing  to  give  my  body,  my  soul, everything I have!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Someone please ....... Please ...... help me ............." </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu bites his lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were hints that could have inferred that Rugato was a vampire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-269"></a>But as a result, he missed it, and the situation was irretrievable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first place, the Dizard Empire had no contact with other countries, and no one had actually seen the vampire's appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  he  had  released  the  ability  suppression  as  soon  as  they  had  realized  the  difference  in  ability between  them  and  Rugato,  both  Tima  and  Mars  would  not  have  suffered  unnecessary  and monstrous injuries, and the result might not have been as bad as it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that was only an excuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and the others were defeated, and now they were crawling on the floor like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A feeling of deep regret wells up and tightens Nozomu's heart to the breaking point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looks up to see Rugato and his contracted messenger making a comeback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop! Stop! If you want a soul, take my soul!  So please don't take Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's plaintive voice, bound in the same manner as Nozomu, further tightens Nozomu's chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the messenger of the contract had pulled out Somia's soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl's face, which had been smiling so cheerfully, lost its expression, and her skin, which had been so rich in blood color, turned pale all at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face is the same as the face of death that Shino had on her face when she was about to die from the sleeping sickness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuhh......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mind recalled the sadness that tore through his entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could not help the person who finally make open of his exchanged hearts. Moreover, when he had gained power, he could not help Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not only sadness that welled up in his chest at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino was laughing in the arms of his beloved apprentice at the end of her life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had passed away with a satisfied smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even now, he still feel sad that she is already gone, and his eyes involuntarily well up when he remember it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu has no regrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was able to accept the wish of his master who always cared for him in the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Then how about now? Is it okay to just watch Somia-chan die like this?) No, definitely hell no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the very end, Nozom Bountis cannot accept this ending. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-270"></a>Nozomu clutches at the invisible chains of oppression that binds him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fear, guilt, regret, grief, resentment, anger. The invisible chain creaks and squeaks as the various passions overflow one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Nozomu's ears suddenly heard a voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Someone please ....... Please ...... help me ............." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What he heard was Irisdina's plea, which sounded as if it were scraping. The voice is so weak that it's hard to imagine it from her normal voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he heard it, Nozomu shrugged off all the anguish he had been feeling, tore off the chains that bound him, and released the suppression of his abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explosive power ran over the surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A torrent of violent pure power that swept away the magical power of Rugato as if to say "don't think you can do everything you want" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world is this ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato turned his attention to the main source of the power that had suddenly begun to rage, and saw a boy standing up, creaking his magical chains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, the boy shredded the binding magic like paper shavings and scrubbed it out of Rugato's sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Rugato was letting out a startled cry, Nozomu, who had been running at full speed, leapt and jump at the messenger of the contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade at his waist is swung, and multiple sword flashes are sent out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The messenger of the contract was cut into tiny pieces, and then dissipated again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato hurriedly moves away and checks the boy again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His appearance had not changed, but a visible density of qi was emanating from his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato could not see past Nozomu's current movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  suppressing  the  turmoil  that  welled  up  inside  him,  Nozomu  peeked  sideways  at  his companions. Irisdina and her friends were also staring at Nozomu with shocked expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Don't these girls know? Definitely, such an amount of power. It is clearly imposible for a single person to have......) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-271"></a>The messenger of the contract was created by the former head of the Waziart family, whom Rugato once served, and if ranked, it is a powerful messenger that reaches the A rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, urged by the sense of danger crawling up his back, uses his ten fingers to activate multiple spells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A storm of magic bullets, far more dense than ever before, hits Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu activates his flash step to break away from the oncoming storm of magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic bullets fired at his body were not even grazed, but landed on the walls and floor, sending up debris from the roof tiles in vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato did not care, but continued to fire magic in rapid succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He not only shoots magic bullets, but also spews flames from the floor and slashes at them with his blood sword, which he holds aloft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's attacks, however, failed to inflict even a scratch on Nozomu's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He drew a fast, complex curved trajectory, dodging all the magic Rugato unleashed and slashing at the oncoming blood sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Nah, it's too fast!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">While moving at a high speed that surpassed the vampire's dynamic vision, Nozomu was in full control of all his movements without being overwhelmed by that speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's consciousness was overshadowed by the drastic change in Nozomu's appearance, and the accuracy of his magic slowed slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, Nozomu rushes in, as if cutting through a gap in Rugato's consciousness, and closes the gap in an instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuuuuh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato managed to catch the blade swung at his side with the blood sword he had generated as quickly as he could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the impact, both of Rugato's arms are subjected to an intense load. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  tried  to  push  Nozomu  back  by  putting  all  his  strength  into  his  arms  and  even  using reinforcement magic, but the blades, which were firmly clinched together, did not move even a fraction of a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Kuh, I'm being pushed in!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato's specs as a race were far superior to Nozomu's, but Nozomu began to push him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's blade closes the distance and approaches in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-272"></a>Judging that he would be pushed away at this rate, Rugato began to pour all his magical power into the blade of his blood sword at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of the blood sword, in which an excessive amount of magic power had been poured, exploded, and Rugato's body was blown away by the impact of the explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shards of the blood sword scattered by the impact hurt his body, but the vampire's regenerative abilities healed the wounds he had get in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the gap between the explosions, Rugato leaps to get out of the way of the explosion, even if only a little, and activates his magic with his ten fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge shadow spreads on the floor of the hall and begins to foam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu came through the smoke of the explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  leapt  backward,  perhaps  sensing  the  explosion  of  the  blood  sword,  and  his  body  was unscathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, a black chin reminiscent of the mouth of a giant lizard leaps out of the shadows and attacks Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mandible of Moros. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A high-level magic classified as advanced magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  huge  mouth,  which  occupies  the  entire  width  of  the  great  hall,  comes  at  Nozomu's  feet  to swallow him up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge mouth as big as a man's being, looming up to swallow him from under Nozomu's feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu, on the contrary, leapt to a foothold in the jaws that were about to chew him up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He kicked the ceiling and closed the gap between himself and Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crap!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato ran while producing blood swords in both hands, trying to keep as much distance between him and Nozomu as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, he uses his little finger dexterously to shoot a magic bullet for restraint him, but it is easily handled and finally allows Nozomu to approach </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two cut each other at high speed, running in all directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, however, was quickly cornered by Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-273"></a>Wielding blood swords in both hands, the vampire attempts to retreat from the oncoming nozomu, but  the  fast  and  precise  swing  of  the  swords  breaks  Lugato's  twin  sword  defense  in  just  a  few strokes, carving lacerations into the vampire's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gguhh, tsk, gah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  continues  to  slash  at  Rugato,  twisting  around  him  like  a  serpent,  even  the  vampire's regenerative abilities are not enough to stop him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the vampire's regenerative abilities heal the wound, the pain is sure to drive him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Rugato's stance was severely disrupted by a slash to his leg as he tried to break free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato managed to regain his stance, but his legs were completely stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is bad......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fight then turns into a foot-stopping exchange of blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The speed at which wounds are carved into Rugato's body increases at an accelerating rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guh...... not yet, it's not over yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Rugato was further torn in his body, he suddenly transformed his body into a myriad of bats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The slash of Nozomu slashes the sky without catching the countless bats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato then sends the bats toward Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless fangs and claws attack Nozomu, but  he skillfully uses his sword and sheath to shoot them down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the overwhelming number of bats gradually overwhelms Nozomu, and wounds begin to appear on his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bats rushed in to swallow Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, however, Nozomu raises his fist and slams it into the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu - Annihilation Light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The extreme light that erupted from the floor burned up all the bats that had rushed to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"GAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Literally burned all over, Rugato was forced back into human form from the state of a bat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smoke rises from his entire body, and the smell of burning flesh fills the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain was so intense that Rugato's consciousness became clouded. When he came to, he found that Nozomu had finished preparing for the chase. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-274"></a>An  enormous  amount  of  qi  is  sent  to  the  blade  of  the  sword  Nozomu  is  carrying,  and  it  is compressed in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword, which had been infused with a dense qi-blade, was sheathed, and a powerful sword qi struck Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato felt a chill like never before at the sight of Nozomu holding the sword at his hip, and he deployed the barrier with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A magical barrier that can withstand advanced magic. It is deployed in four layers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although these are four thin magical barriers, their strength is comparable to the walls of a fortress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you think about it, the only attack that could break through this barrier would be the largest scale ritual magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the sword is pulled out from its scabbard . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of that curved sword, compressed and sharpened to an ultra-thin blade, sliced through the four layers of barriers without difficulty, cutting the contract Rugato was holding in his hand as well as his body in two pieces. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/K0FqFrC/000010.jpg" alt="000010" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Rugato's body was cut in two by the qijutsu Phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The contract he was holding was also cut in two, and the messenger he was trying to revive fizzled out, black ball and all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chains restraining Somia also disappear, and her soul, which had been taken out, returns to her body as if pulled by a connected tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  because Nozomu  had defeated  Lugato,  Irisdina was also  being freed from  the restraint magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She rushes over to Somia in a panic and picks up her sister's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane......-sama......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina shook her body repeatedly while screaming her sister's name, but when she confirmed her sister's voice, her cheeks broke into tears as if she was relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad. I'm really glad ... uhu, uh ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina hugged her sister's body tightly with a tearly eyes, and Nozomu breathed a sigh of relief that Somia had regained consciousness and that she was able to settle the matter before she was crushed by Tiamat's power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  looked  down  at  his  arm  again  and  saw  that  blood  was  beginning  to  seep  out  of  the underside of the fabric of his uniform in a trickle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body was beginning to suffer lacerations, unable to withstand the power of the released Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His whole body is screaming in pain and fatigue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time is running out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying not to show his wounds and the load he has taken on, Nozomu slowly turns his gaze back to Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato has been cut off from the left shoulder to the waist, but to his surprise, he is still alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is looking up at the boy who defeated him, still conscious despite the great amount of blood pouring from his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up at the boy who had defeated him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A vampire as great as I am is not going to ...... die unless my ...... heart ...... organs or ...... head </p>
<p class="calibre1">...... are destroyed. Unless ...... destroyed, vampires don't die ....... Only if it's a mithril, not a sword slash ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-277"></a>Nozomu looked surprised, but inwardly felt relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if he had to fight for his life, he does not necessarily want to become a murderer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The question was whether the old vampire still intended to go after Somia's soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu slowly thrust the tip of his sword in front of him to confirm the dying Rugato's intentions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry. You have won ....... That is why ...... I will not take you ...... with me, Somia-sama" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu finally exudes qi from his entire body, as if to intimidate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In any case,...... the contract to control the messenger has also been destroyed. Now this contract is virtually impossible ...... to fulfill. All that remains ...... is for the Waziart and Francilt families to discuss and settle this matter." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato, lying on the floor, is already in no condition to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the old man's words and his vanished will to fight, Nozomu exhaled heavily and sheathed his sword, thinking that it was finally over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisible chains wrap around his body again, and the mighty power that had overflowed vanishes as if it had been an illusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, my legs ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The recoil that accompanies the release of power attacks Nozomu with intense fatigue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His legs lose strength and he falls to the floor with a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up to see the Francilt sisters, holding hands, coming toward him in a panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Tima had also managed to raise their shredded bodies on the ground and were looking at Nozomu and the others as if leaning in close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, who noticed Nozomu's gaze, smiled, and Marus looked as if he was amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of everyone's safety finally relaxed his shoulders, and the breath of relief leaked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'How do i explain my strength?' With the exhausted head of Nozomu, he can't think of anything at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless of the difficulties, he was just happy that he was able to keep everyone smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tension is released, and a sudden feeling of drowsiness comes over Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The release of the suppression of his  abilities quickly dragged his consciousness down into the dark depths of the lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">- And then... </p>
