<h3>Chapter &#8211; 5 With One's Dying Wish In One's Heart</h3>

<p class="calibre1">A place in northern land. In land near the permafrost, it snows even in spring and is constantly exposed to strong winds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind blows violently, creating a storm that freezes everything in its path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this land, which has been frozen at all times, the soil only peeks out in the summer, making it a land normally unsuitable for human habititation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there are those who dare to settle in such a place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are the outsiders race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are those who have been repelled and persecuted for various reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a country where such people live in this northern land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Dizard Empire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An isolated country that has no diplomatic relations with any country on the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In one of the territories of such an imperial kingdom, a castle made up of countless icicles stood alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A section of the castle closed off by ice. An old gentleman wearing a pair of glasses walks down the cold, deserted, and unpopular dull corridor of the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead of him stands a large door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman slowly opens the door, which is too huge for one person to open, and bows deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman opened the door slowly and bowed deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My Lord, this is Rugato, I have something to ask you. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, what is it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of his bowed head, there is a throne that gives off an eerie atmosphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The throne is placed with its back to the old gentleman, and it is impossible to see what kind of person is sitting on the throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, that person reply to the old gentleman, who introduced himself as Rugato, there was a fascinating sex appeal that captivated all who heard him, as well as a coldness like a snowstorm that enveloped the castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The time for the fulfillment of the contract made by your predecessor is approaching." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-175"></a>"Ah, the contract that my father made. What kind of one?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is a contract with a certain landlord in the southern country. The time for collecting the goods we gave to help him is approaching. How would you like to do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A white, lithe arm peeks out from the edge of the throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that hand was a wine glass filled with red liquid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's up to you. Make it quick. If there are any obstacles, don't mind to eliminating it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That person shook the glass and played with the poured liquid, but the voice showed no interest in Rugato's story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  way  that  person  didn't  even  confirm  what  kind  of  item  was  would  beretrieving  told  how indolent this old gentleman was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman's reluctance to confirm the nature of the items to be recovered was a testament to his indolence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Considering the state of our country, ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No problem. Our emperor may be somewhat annoyed, but it is not a big problem. We are not going against emperor wishes. Besides, I hear that the Geryunus family will be coming soon. We must make preparations to welcome them as soon as possible, don't you think?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing the Lord's will behind it words to go quickly, Rugato made no further suggestions to the Lord and bowed deeply with his hands clasped to his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand," he said. "I will come to retrieve it immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, do that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old gentleman turned his back without a word to the Lord, who was urging him to leave the room, and left the Lord's apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  he  closed  the  door  behind  him,  the  old  gentleman's  body  slowly  began  to  blur  into  a  black shadow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon the black shadows burst in all directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The numerous pieces of the shadow that scattered became a swarm of bat bats, which flew around the corridor, making shrill, shrill noises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The countless bats eventually flew out of the nearest window and disappeared into the sky through the blizzard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-176"></a>† </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been a week since the farewell to Shino. Nozomu had to take three supplementary exams due to the effects of his injury, but he had managed to overcome the end-of-year exams and had advanced to the third grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His third year in Arcazam was about to begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until the main gate of the school, Nozomu was thinking about many things, including Lisa and his separation from his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He might run away again, or he might remain standing still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he knew that he was done turning away from the fact that he had run away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  his  master's  teachings  and  a  renewed  determination  in  his  heart,  he  entered  the  gates  of Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, I was able to promote well" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tapping his finger on the black nameplate that still sits on his chest, Nozomu once again reflects on the results of the supplementary examinations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of subjects on the supplementary examinations was undoubtedly the highest in the school's history, and Nozomu's class was once again in the tenth grade at the bottom of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His class was again at the bottom of the tenth grade, and he was  also at the very bottom of the grade order when he entered the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the devastation of his practical skills, including the supplementary examinations, he was given a mercy promotion after desperately trying to solve the written examinations.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, he can expect to be treated as a dropout in the class he will going to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu was not saddened by the fact that he was being treated as a dropout, in fact he was a little relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But I think it's probably better to keep it that way for now. The dragon slayer's power is too strong for me to handle right now.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle with Shino had released the suppression of his abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The released power dramatically enhanced Nozomu's abilities, but too much power enhanced all kinds of techniques too much, and even a mere fist strike, not to mention qijutsu, which originally had high killing power, was no longer usable in a mock battle at the academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even huge rock is pulverized into tiny dust just by punching it," he said. (Besides, there's that being ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-177"></a>After his battle with Shino, Nozomu had removed his supression several times deep in the forest to test his power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Tiamat within him was rampaging through Nozomu's body, trying to devour him from the inside out every time he released his restraints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  because  he  was  able  to  face  his  own  escape  in  the  battle  with  his  master,  or  perhaps because he had succeeded in capturing Tiamat's power, albeit partially in the spiritual world, he was not immediately devoured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still, two minutes at the most. That was the limit I had when I actually released it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even those two minutes were spent by Nozomu desperately trying to restrain himself. If he had used his power without thinking, he was sure that his soul would have been crushed by the force or his body would have collapsed within a seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyway, I had to think about what I was going to do. I haven't had a chance to see Lisa since i moved up to the next grade." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were originally from different ranks, and Nozomu had too much going on at the end of a very busy school year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if they meet face to face, it is easy to imagine that she will either ignore him as she did before, or she will be hostile to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  thought  of  that  scene  brought  an  indescribable  feeling  of  disgust  to  the  back  of  Nozomu's chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I want to run away again. I ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu still carries the fear of being rejected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now he was able to be aware of his own desire to run away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Shino risked her life to tell him has indeed sprouted a small bud inside him and is beginning to take root. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Nozomu  opens  the  door  to  his  third-grade,  tenth-grade  classroom,  his  classmates,  upon seeing him, give him a disgusted look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words of ridicule were hurled at him. Whispering to the mindset of wanting to hurt others because of the sense of entrapment from not being rewarded for their efforts, they look at Nozomu with contempt and disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They look at him with contempt and disgust, turning away from the sense of inferiority they carry deep in their hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-178"></a>Nozomu ignores their words and glances and goes to the seat assigned to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brand-new desk he was to use for the year already had a few cuts on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, Nozomu looks at his classmates, who are staring at him with contempt. His eyes had a strong light in them, a light that had not been there before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The classmates were startled by Nozomu's strong gaze, and their eyes widened in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the door to the classroom slammed open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good morning~, everyone!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  person  who  entered  the  classroom  was  Anri  Var,  who  had  been  in  charge  of  assistant homeroom teacher in the second grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was still spreading the same warm, sunny spring air, and and everyone in the classroom was stunned as if poison had been drained out of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I look forward to working with you all for the one year ahead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri is a newcomer as a teacher, but it seems that he has been entrusted with a new homeroom teacher this year, albeit a 10th grade homeroom teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hora, Hora, I'm going to take attendance~, so everyone take your seats." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her words were so clear that everyone returned to their seats in confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now~, let me introduce myself once again. I'm Anri Var, and I'll be working with you all from today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri introduced herself in a cheerful tone, but the tenth-grade students did not respond well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is only natural. They were the ones who had come to the end of the school year examinations with the goal of achieving a higher level, but ended up at the bottom of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their disappointment was great because they had worked so hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Anri's benevolent smile never falters, even in the face of his own students' disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone is in the tenth grade. Sure, you all the lowest in grade, but I don't think I need to worry about it~. Because I was the same way~. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri speaks to the students who look down. She told them that she, too, was once a student of this school and a student of the tenth grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone here has a talent that shines as brightly as the students in the other classes. It's just that everyone don't know how to use it. The important thing is to know yourself better now, not the others, and to keep challenging yourself. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-179"></a>Anri's gaze glances toward Nozomu. The most important thing to remember is that you can't just take a look at the world around you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the first time you see a person in a new year, you will be able to see that he or she has a new year ahead of him or her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's start a new year! Attendance number one, Alton Sahag!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, present!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri takes a look at the faces of each of the students she will be taking on for the next year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The students of the tenth grade who have been scorned as garbage and stones up to now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two years of gloom and doom have faded from the voices of the students as they answer to the names of their former homeroom teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Anri took attendance in a crisp voice, Mars, who was seated at the very back of the room, stared intently at the back of Nozomu, who was seated in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars would normally have been in a higher rank, but he had been place to advance to the tenth rank again because of problems with his classroom attitude and so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he was not concerned about that. What occupies his mind is a male student in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no hint of contempt in his eyes, but rather a seriousness as if he is checking something out, trying to figure out what it is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why is he in this bottom class? If he is so good, he should be in a higher class.) Remembering the mock battle at the end of the second grade, Mars puts his hand over his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A battle in which he had to admit that he had been defeated. He had been robbed of his composure and outsmarted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, he was extremely angry at himself for failing to recognize the effort and ability that Nozomu had accumulated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, once the temporary fury subsided, what came next was his strong interest in Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(He had been injured during the final examinations. The story goes that he chipped himself on the stairs while carrying his luggage, but that would never happen to anyone but him. ......) Knowing  Nozomu's  amazing  qi  control  and  sense  of  balance,  Mars  is  convinced  that  Nozomu would not be seriously injured by a fall on the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-180"></a>Even though it was a mock sword, he did not suffer any serious injuries when he was blown away by Mars' sword, which was enhanced by qijutsu, and he was able to attend class the next day as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was injured before the most important exam, the final exam of the school  year, to the extent that it interfered with his performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars was convinced that Nozomu had some secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the first day of the third grade, the morning was mainly spent confirming what students would learn  during  the  year,  various  exams,  and  school  events,  but  by  the  afternoon,  normal  classes resumed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's begin the afternoon classes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri's slow voice echoed through the training hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first class of the third grade, tenth class, was a comprehensive combat technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike one-on-one mock battles, this class is a party-based battle, so teamwork is the key, not just individual combat skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, it is dangerous for even veteran knights to fight alone against Demonic beasts that are powerful on their own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adventurers, who could retire with a single serious injury, also usually form parties of several to a dozen people to manage risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason, the academy also offers many classes on group battles in order to  cultivate the ability  to  judge  the  roles  of  each  party  and  to  respond  to  various  situations  through  battles  in multiple parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The percentage increases with the higher grades, and in the third grade, most of the practical skills are party competitions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following Anri's call, the classmates begin to form their own parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, while the rest of the classmates were forming parties, Nozomu was left alone, unable to form a party with anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he tries to call out to the parties already formed, he is ignored. Nozomu scratched his cheek, as if he was troubled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I knew that, but what i can do ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-181"></a>This class would be meaningless unless it was paired with more than one person. The second grade, when Caskell was in charge of the class, had team competitions from time to time, but Nozomu, who couldn't team up with anyone, was always left at the end of the training field because he was considered unnecessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, during the team competition classes, Nozomu could do nothing more than sit at the edge of the training area and pretend not to get in the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(However, it is no good to settle for the same situation as last year. I need to find someone to team up with.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike in the past, when he was constantly running away from things, today Nozomu is conscious of trying to do something about his current situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to Nozomu's wishes, everyone has refused to allow him to join their party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this situation continues, the class itself will not be possible. The time they had spent together would be meaningless to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, an unexpected person spoke to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, you. If you don't have anyone to team up with, why don't you team up with us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Nozomu's surprise, Mars, the most problematic boy in the tenth grade, asked him if he wanted to work with him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His cronies looked surprised, and his classmates were in an uproar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, come on, Mars, you can't be serious! Why do you bother to let useless people in?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars's cronies are crowding around him in disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a natural reaction. Mars was the one student in the class who had been particularly critical of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was the first to be eliminated as a candidate, and Nozomu himself didn't think they would work together, so he didn't talk to Mars and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, on the other hand, did not take any notice of the cronies who complained or the clamor of the people around him, but simply stared at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also wondered about Mars' meaningful gaze, but he had no choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said, "............ got it. I'm in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the most improbable party in the class was completed; Nozomu, Mars, and his cronies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone, you all already got a party! Let's get started!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-182"></a>Anri's languid signal to begin the mock battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Mars' party consisted of four members in total. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of Mars' cronies, one is a archer and the other is a mage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and his party oppenent are also a party of four in total. Two boys were swordsmen, one was a spearman, and one was a girl with two daggers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  signal  to  begin  the  mock  battle,  the  opposing  swordsman  and  spearman  first  cast  a reinforcement spell on themselves and slashed at Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They probably intend to suppress Mars, who is recognized as the most powerful person in Nozomu and his party, which consists of two vanguards and two rearguards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars drew his great sword and met their attack from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A high-pitched sound of metal clashing rang out, and a powerful blow, enhanced by reinforcement magic, struck Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  he,  who  had  strengthened  his  body  with  qi-jutsu,  fully  demonstrated  his  physical strength and tried to push his opponent back without backing down even a single step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Mars is blocking the attack of the opponent's vanguard, Nozomu goes on the offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He and Mars team up, and he spins around to attack the two who have stopped moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before they could get into a face-off, a gust of wind blew in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A blade of wind, a wind magic, passed in front of Nozomu's eyes. The wind blade was in front of Nozomu's eyes. Nozomu looked in the direction of the blade and saw a dagger-wielding female student chanting a magic spell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dagger-using schoolgirl was chanting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Obey my will and manifest, The Blade of the Wind!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade of wind, activated again, strikes Nozomu, splitting him and Mars apart. It seems that the other party intends to separate Mars and Nozomu and destroy them individually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering that Mars is indeed the most capable fighter in this party, it is strategically necessary to separate him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, from the flank of Nozomu who had been pulled apart, another swordsman slashed at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-183"></a>A phosphorescent glow of magical power rises from his body, indicating that this male student, too, is using enhancement magic on himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I got you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu immediately draws his sword. Using his sword and body softly, he parries his opponent's slashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was not in good shape at the time of the final exam due to his injuries from the fight with Shino, but now that his wounds have healed properly, Nozomu's body is doing exactly what he wants it to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other swordsman was thrown off his stance by Nozomu's slash as he rushed forward with great force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, having dealt with the opponent's rush, tries to throw a roundhouse kick to the flank of the opponent, who has been left open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just before Nozomu's foot strike caught his opponent, a fireball suddenly rushed in from behind and exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What flew in was a fireball classified as beginner magic. It is a general-purpose magic that ejects formed fireballs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that the fireballs are not only a fireball, but also a bunch fireball of fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, who in the world ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu gets to his feet, passively shrugging off the impact of being blown away, he sees Mars' </p>
<p class="calibre1">cronies leaping into his eyes. The particulars are not really a lot of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got him in, too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care," he said. "He's useless, just a decoy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fireballs were fired by Mars' cronies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actuality that the actual fireballs are going to be used as decoys, they are not going to feel any pain or itch if they are involved in your own attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(They are ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  got  up,  but  while  he  was  being  blown  away,  the  other  party's  swordsman,  who  had regrouped while Nozomu was being blown away, slashed at him from behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-184"></a>"Cih!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  two  sword  joined  the  offensive  and  made  him  defensive,  Nozomu  constantly switched his body while parrying the long sword and dagger being swung down, and repeatedly moved to avoid being attacked at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, from behind Nozomu's evasive stance, a fire was coming at him with no mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ha ha! Nice target!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only magic, but also bow attacks were added to the mix, and things were finally getting out of hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with beginner-level magic, the impact and heat of an explosion at close range will inevitably slow you down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, arrows fired in the gaps between the magic attacks were hurled at Nozomu and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  cronies'  attacks  were  well  matched  in  terms  of  long-range  attacks,  and  their  strengths intertwined well to eliminate the disadvantages of magic chanting time and the gap before the next arrow could be fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was no hesitation in involving Nozomu in the coordinated attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cronies seemed to be enjoying the play of Nozomu more than the mock battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu judged the two cronies to be the enemy and Nozomu was all over the place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uahhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two opponents involuntarily move away from the large horizontal cleave. In the gap, Nozomu used the momentum from his cleave to turn around and activate his flash step, which accelerated toward his party in a single bound. He accelerated toward his cronies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two cronies, looking panicked, and fired a flaming bullet that had been on standby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A ball of flame flying at high speed approached Nozomu's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sliced through the flaming bullet with a single sword from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flames split in half, and the formula collapsed, fading away like a phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-185"></a>"You bottom-feeder!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another  crony  fires  an  arrow,  but  it  is  rebounded  by  Nozomu's  sword,  which  is  quickly superimposed on the arrow's trajectory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, huahh . ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  swung  his  sword  mercilessly  at  the  flailing  pair,  knocking  their  weapons  away  and slamming his fist into their stomachs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the two men writhed in agony, Nozomu turned the tables again. He tried to intercept the other party's swordsman and dagger user, who were in pursuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just as Nozomu returned his sword, a powerful chill came over him from the left side of his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if rushed by the chill crawling up his spine, Nozomu uses his legs to break away as fast as he can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, Nozomu's vision caught a glimpse of Mars, who was rushing toward him with his great sword raised in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two members of the opposing party who had been fighting him were lying on the  ground, probably already knocked down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Geez!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it'a bad ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Nozomu, the other party's swordsman and dagger user were slow to react. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  his  enhanced  physical  strength  and  the  wind  blade,  Mars'  front  was  swept  away  in  a  fan shape,  and  the  remaining  two  members  of  the  other  party  were  blown  away,  rendering  them incapable of fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu and Mars glared at each other silently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Nozomu had not broken away from the attack with his legs, he would have surely been caught up in the earlier blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's face was filled with anger at Mars, who had clearly intended to reap Nozomu as well as his cronies, who were friendly fire without hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His eyebrows furrowed as he glared squarely at Mars, and even Mars' cronies, who had somehow managed to catch their breath, shook their shoulders. They are overwhelmed by Nozomu's anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-186"></a>Until now, Nozomu had always turned away from everything at the school. In the past, he would have immediately looked away and shut himself away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  Nozomu  himself  was  unaware  of  the  change  in  him,  Mars's  cronies,  who  were confronted with his anger, were puzzled and fearful at the obvious change in his appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu, who had been trembling with anger, soon began to have doubts in his mind about Mars's unusual appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who had just reaped Nozomu, had no trace of the disdain in his eyes that had been directed at Nozomu until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What the hell is he trying to do?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' attitude has suddenly changed since entering the third grade. However, the mouth of Mars, who stared at Nozomu, never opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, the class is over and dismissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu leaves the training ground, tilting his head at the questions floating in his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, the cronies who had friendly-fired on Nozomu were taken away by Anri, who had a devilish look on her face, and were given a sermon at the edge of the training ground and ordered to clean up the training ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  classes  were  over,  Mars  was  thinking  about  Nozomu's  condition  as  he  walked  down  the school corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That guy ...... has changed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  remembered  the  way  Nozomu  had  glared  at  him  when  he  had  attacked  him,  willing  to  get involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But what kind of training was he doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting aside the unanswerable question for the moment, Mars recalls the mock battle he just had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual fact is, he was admiring Nozomu's movement, which was practically one against four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While moving to his opponent's blind spot, yet always moving without waste so that it was one-on-one, he did not get flustered by fire attack from his allies, but immediately judged them to be the enemy and acted accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, in this situation, he sensed Mars' unexpected sudden attack and immediately moved to evade. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-187"></a>Mars is convinced. He is convinced that he would not be able to handle an attack from as many as four  people  in  a  suppressed  state  like  Nozomu's.  There  is  no  doubt  that  he  has  a  very  broad perspective and excellent crisis perception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is quite used to fighting. Where did he get such experience?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  only  places  in  this  town  where  one  can  gain  experience  in  battle  are  the  academy  and  the forests that surround the town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only place left is the Spasim Forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He may have received a request from the guild to take on a quest, but it is doubtful that the guild would allow him to take on a quest if he could not form a party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The guild deliberates whether or not to allow him to accept requests based on his rank, but as for the students of Solminati Academy, the guild often gives consideration to the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for a student to receive a request from the guild, such as a request to take down a tree, the guild often requires the student to hold a certain rank or to be in a party with several other people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  Spasim  Forest  was  originally  an  uncultivated  forest,  high-ranked  Demonic  beasts sometimes appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The school wants to avoid losing valuable candidates, so this kind of arrangement is made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Is that guy going into the forest all by himself?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only other place where you can gain real-world experience is in the forest, but it would be reckless for a student to go into a forest overrun by monsters and beasts alone, and no one would do such a thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though there are no powerful Demonic beasts near the town, this is not absolute, and there have been cases where travelers have actually been attacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  otherwise,  it  would  be  hard  to  explain  the  movements  of  Nozomu,  who  is  obviously accustomed to actual combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's check it...... to see if it's true." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars,  having  made  up  his  mind,  walked  quickly  down  the  corridor,  looking  for  the  person  he wanted to see. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">After class, Nozomu returned to the dormitory immediately, got ready, and went outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-188"></a>The destination was  Shino's  hut.  He was  going to  Shino's hut,  because his  training as a dragon slayer had to be done in a place where he would not be seen by the public. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He headed for the Spasim Forest, moving quickly through the streets of the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, on the way to the forest, Nozomu felt a strange sensation on the street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He felt someone's eyes on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had felt the eyes on him since he left the dormitory, but the fact that they did not stop even after he entered the town meant that they were definitely following him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He asked, "...... who are you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">'At first I thought it was someone who did not think well of me at the school, but I did not feel the sharp arrow-like malice or hostility that such a gaze often contains. Also, the number of stares I feel is small.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">When someone has malicious intent, they are usually in a clique, and there are many stares, but this time there is only one stare that is following Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sure it can spread out if we go into the forest......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has no particular memory of being followed by anyone at the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to keep in mind is that you should not be afraid to ask for help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'The fact that the eyes are observant, without hostility or harm, makes me wonder if they know I'm a dragon slayer. I had a bad feeling that he might have found out that I was the Dragon Slayer.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'll have to check ...... to be sure) </p>
<p class="calibre1">'If we spread the information, we might get into trouble. It would be a problem to take that guys to Shino's hut in the forest.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking  of  that,  Nozomu  turned  off  the  main  street  and  headed  down  a  small  street  in  the commercial district. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He passes through the intricate alleyways, dodging and dodging the miscellaneous loads placed there, and continues onward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After passing through the alley, Nozomu emerged into an open space. Ahead, a huge wall rises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arcazam is surrounded by walls to prevent the intrusion of demonic beasts and other creatures that inhabit the surrounding forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the buildings of the city are built at a considerable distance from the walls in order to provide a place to deploy troops and store supplies in the event of a large-scale invasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving at the outer edge of the city, Nozomu slowly turns to the path he came from. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-189"></a>The owner of the eyes had been following Nozomu all along the path, even as he veered off the path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shadows created by the twilight hid the exit of the path in darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stared into the shadows, trying to see who was behind the shadows, his muscles relaxed, ready to move at any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His breathing naturally becomes shallow, and the corners of his eyes hang open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large figure emerges from the pathway, perhaps taking note of Nozomu's condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew, you had notice it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who emerged from the shadows of the pathway was Mars, carrying a great sword on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell do you think you're doing, why you following me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? I just want to make sure of something." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you want to make sure?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're looking for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual a lot more the better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing out of the blue?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing, I'm just asking you to answer my question" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why are you pointing your sword at me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' body was already full of qi, and he was clearly ready for battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was surprised by the sudden attack, but in the face of the battle spirit directed at him, he immediately switched his consciousness and strengthened his whole body with qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sei!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars uses his enhanced physical abilities to the fullest, unleashing a barrage of blows not unlike those of a great sword user. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Top to bottom-slash, sideways, bottom to top. Three consecutive strikes, without even a pause for breath, came at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not a series of hand slashes, but a powerful slash with enough power to hold his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This alone suggests the high level of Mars's ability as a great sword user. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A series of blows with a heavy weapon such as a great sword is a very advanced technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-190"></a>A half-breed's physical ability would be swept away by the weight of a great sword, and he would never be able to deliver a flowing barrage of blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu easily survived Mars's serious barrage of blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He avoided the first slash by turning his body to the side, and the next slash by crouching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He also received the final reverse slash by leaning his sword against the blade line and at the same time taking a step forward at an angle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  flexibly  maneuvers  the  vector  of  the  force  he  receives  and  guides  Mars'  sword  fight  to  the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gugu!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great sword he swung struck the ground, sending a powerful shock to Mars' arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu then stomps on Mars' sword with his left foot, which is now in the ground, to lock it in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Mars' face contorted as his weapon was pinned to the ground by his foot, Nozomu readied the sword he was carrying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Nozomu's blade can swing through, Mars releases his hand from the great sword and concentrates his qi in his fist to create a mass of wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooohhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a yell, Mars released the wind created in his fist at close range of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thud! A stomach-churning explosion sounded, pushing Nozomu's body backward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu, Wind blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, it was a qi-jutsu of the wind attribute, in which the fist is filled with a mass of wind to increase its striking power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, like Mars, it is a highly applicable technique that can also be used to release the gathered wind and blow the opponent away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The released wind pushes Nozomu's body back a few meters, and then they rejoin in time to face each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars draws his greatsword, which is driven into the ground, while Nozomu leans back and points the tip of his sword at his opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They glare at each other out of pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both remain motionless with their weapons at the ready. Only time passes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-191"></a>Staring  at  Nozomu,  who  points  the  tip  of  his  sword  at  him,  Mars  again  marvels  at  the  skill  he possesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I see. I guess in terms of pure swordsmanship, he's better than me. ......) He is overwhelmingly superior in terms of his physical strength and energy, but he is unable to attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, even when he used his full strength in a series of blows, he was ducked, passed over, and almost struck in the opposite direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Based on the previous mock battle, Mars understood once again the difference in skill between him and Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why he wanted to know the reason why the man in front of him was able to reach such a high level of skill with the disadvantage of ability supression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he could know that, he felt that he could become stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More, even more stronger. ......... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry for slashing at you so suddenly." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of them are now in the same room, and the two of them are now in the same room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want to ask you something. How did you acquire such skill?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My ...... sword skill?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"yeah, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is also true that the current Mars does not show the hostility and harm that he had been receiving. After a second or two of silence, Nozomu slowly opens his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He says, "I had a ...... master. I've been under her training since freshman year." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can I see her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, you can't. She's already dead" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. ...... What kind of training did you receive?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual training is a lot more than just swinging and running in a forest riddled with demonic beasts, and mock battles where lethal techniques are launched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu speaks in an unwavering and confident tone of voice. On the other hand, Mars' eyebrows gradually lifted as he listened, and he let out an exasperated sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm surprised you're still alive. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-192"></a>"I wonder why." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that comes to mind is the too severe training from his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  was  convinced.  Your  extraordinary  swordsmanship,  precise  movements,  and  good  judgment must have been cultivated under your master." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu nodded his head with an indescribable expression at Mars' words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His fighting style is rooted in the swordsmanship that was passed down to him by Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The experience of being attacked by demonic beasts while being forced to run through the woods played a major role in developing Nozomu's tactical sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same is true of his movements during group mock battles. He always moves to avoid being surrounded and to create one-on-one situations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is something he learned while fighting wild dogs and other demonic beasts that hunt in packs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the same is true of the  mock battle with Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fighting  with  her,  who  possessed  extraordinary  strength,  did  not  allow  for  even  the  slightest moment of carelessness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  one's  actions  were  even  slightly  unreasonable  or  one's  judgment  was  delayed,  one  would immediately be hit in the vital spot and either faint in agony or be knocked unconscious and roused by a deadly blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The experience of repeated suffering was etched into his bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being in such an environment, one's judgment and ability to perceive danger are developed, even if one does not want them to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for Nozomu, it was an experience that, when he recalls it again, makes him break out in a cold sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, why did you follow me? Don't tell me you slash me down just to ask me that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stares at Mars with a frown on his brow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his gaze, there was a clear anger that he would not tolerate any falsehoods or silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been followed and then suddenly slashed at him. Nozomu's reaction was natural. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, however, Nozomu was wondering how much Mars knew about his secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had become a dragon slayer, something that had not existed for the last several hundred years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this secret were to spread, it would surely cause trouble. Now that his master, the only one who knew he was a dragon slayer, was dead, he would have to live with this secret alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-193"></a>Therefore, he is very nervous about the possibility of his secret being exposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh, well, it's .......you know" </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Mars, who was overwhelmed by Nozomu's gaze, scratched his head awkwardly and let his gaze wander around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Mars does not know that Nozomu is a Dragon Slayer, does he?' </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the kind of certainty that comes to Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering  the  character  of  Mars,  it  is  hard  to  believe  that  this  man  would  hesitate  to  say something like this when it comes to swords and strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was relieved that he was not known to be a dragon slayer, but at the same time, he tilted his head at Mars's unusual behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Mars opens his mouth, seeming to have made up his mind. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What I want to say is ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaah! What are you doing, Onii-chan!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud voice interrupts Mars' words and echoes around the outer edges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gee, that girl!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' face twitched with surprise.  If  you look closely,  you can see that the girl who is  running toward him has a face similar to Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What were you trying to do, Onii-chan, bringing another man into this such place?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't do anything! Why are you here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was shopping at the store, I saw Onii-chan walking around with this frown on his face, so I thought he was going to do something strange and then i followed you. Then, sure enough, he's trying to mug here. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No way! Why am I supposed to be mugging?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl spat at him, raising her eyebrows with her fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual a lot more you are able to do, the more you will be able to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, what Mars did to Nozomu was not only a mugging, but an act of street violence. The girl who called Mars her brother also looked at him with suspicion, as if she did not trust his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  seems  that this  girl  is  Mars' sister, and she  also  seems  to  have the  guts to  be unafraid  of her brother, who seems to have bad behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was not afraid of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-194"></a>"It's a foregone conclusion, considering what you've been doing! Do you have any idea how many times I and aunt have bowed down to people who were inconvenienced by you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, Mars is perceived by those around him as an untouchable delinquent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He should have been in a higher class, but the fact that he is still in the tenth grade shows how bad his daily behavior is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the worst delinquent in his grade was also weak against his younger sister, and from a few minutes ago, he had been blamed for the opposite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if he refuted her somewhat, he was immediately shut down with a good argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, Mars seems to be aware of his own bad behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he eventually became unable to even argue with her, and a one-sided verbal attack by his sister followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "our restaurant has been banned from neighborhood because of your behavior! Because of you, the neighborhood kids at my age treat me like a boss! I spent all day and night apologizing to the neighbors because of you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stories kept coming out, so much so that I wondered how they had managed to get this far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever Mars would mention it, he would say, "Ugh! or "Mwah! and moaned in agony, as if he had been stabbed in the chest with an invisible spear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, the girl's sermon shifted to Mars' embarrassing tale of the old days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The last bed-wetting was later than she was," she said. "he wanted to ride a horse, so he jumped on a carriage horse, and the horse was startled and went into a tailspin. The horse was so startled that it went into a stampede, and all the men in the neighborhood came out to catch it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before he knew it, Mars' black history exposure contest had begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  because  of  the  revelation  of  his  past  shame,  Mars  finally  couldn't  take  it  anymore  and nodded his head with his hands on the ground. Even though he deserved it, even Nozomu felt sorry for him. </p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Vxqksmk/000001.jpg" alt="000001" border="0"></a>


<p class="calibre1">The girl who had tortured Mars so much came to Nozomu and bowed to him when she saw that Mars had sunk to the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am sorry," she said. "I apologize for the trouble my foolish brother has caused you" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-196"></a>"Oh, no, it's fine, but ......your brother, is he all right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry," he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good relationship with my brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm sure it will work. He deserves this much" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, that's right. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, I'm late to introduce myself. My name is Ena Dickens and I'm the little sister of this dead brother" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello. I am Nozomu Bountis, a classmate of Mars" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if remembering, the two introduced themselves to each other, but Nozomu's tone was a little stiff, perhaps because of the presence of his classmate crouched down at his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  unlike  Mars,  Nozomu  is  a  very  firm  boy  who  greets  people  in  a  polite  and  proper manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My brother has caused you trouble today. I would like to apologize for that, so if you would like to come to our place, please. We run an inn with a bar, so we can at least treat you to dinner" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu refrains from offering his apology, saying he doesn't mind, but Ena insists, "Since I have caused you trouble, I must make my apology properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll be happy if you treat me a meal. So, what about Mars?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked next to Ena and saw a crouching, cramping Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he was so carefree at the school was a lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not sure what to do. Onii-chan, you're in the way, hurry up and get up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena mercilessly kicked the crouching Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars jumped up reflexively, "What the hell are you doing?" but was disheartened by her sister's glaring eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena then led the way to the Dickens family inn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena led to a corner of the commercial district. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  where  merchants  from  various  countries  gather  and  stay  while  completing  business negotiations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, there are inns of various sizes for the merchants to sleep in, ranging from high-class inns for the big merchants to cheap inns for the menial laborers such as baggage carriers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The inn where Nozomu was taken was an inn with the sign "Gyuto Tei. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-197"></a>The first floor of the inn was used as a restaurant, and rooms for overnight stay were on the second floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is our family's inn, Ushiro-tei," Ena said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena said and disappeared into the entrance of the restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu followed her and was greeted by a well-dressed middle-aged woman wearing an apron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, welcome back, Ena-chan. Did you find Mars-bo? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm back, Hanna-san. He was bothering other people again, so I gave him a good scolding. Oh, and this is the person who got into trouble because onii-chan" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu bowed his head as he was introduced to Ena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, this middle-aged woman named Hannah was the landlady of the inn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, I see. I'm sorry, my stupid boy has caused you trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, she already apologized and I don't mind. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But  I'm  sure we've caused  you trouble, so please take  your time. Hey,  Mars-bo, what  are  you doing bothering people again? Come here for a minute!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ouch, ouch, ouch! Get off me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After guiding Nozomu to an empty seat, Hanna twisted up Mars' ears and took him to the kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the two disappeared completely, a gurgling sound, as if a pot had been banged on their heads, echoed throughout the inn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu is breaking out in a cold sweat, imagining what has taken place, Hannah, who had disappeared into the back of the kitchen earlier, returns with a tray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a plate on the tray was bread with a buttery aroma, grilled meat, and a salad. On the tray was a plate of bread with the aroma of butter, grilled meat, and a salad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry for the waiting," she said. "A dish that is the pride of Ushiro-tei, a conger rabbit steak and assorted salad. This is my apology for the trouble that idiot brother caused, so you don't have to pay for it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying this, Hanna placed the dish in front of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  aroma  of  the  grilled  meat  and  its  juices  bouncing  on  the  stone  plate  stimulates  Nozomu's appetite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is already dinner time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  himself  was  feeling  quite  hungry  after  all  the  physical  exertion  he  had  done  during training and other activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-198"></a>However, the food served to him was luxurious, something that he, as a struggling student, would not normally be able to eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu was hesitating whether he could eat it or not, Hannah urged him to eat it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was hungry, so he quickly reached for the food since it had been prepared for him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the name implies, hole rabbits live in the forests and grasslands around here, digging holes in the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They are also valued for their edible value, and are caught in traps and sold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu cuts the meat in front of him with a knife and fork, and brings it to his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rabbit steak was very tender, as if it had been well pounded before grilling, and had a nice aroma, as if it had been grilled with sake or something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The juices from the meat were so rich that it was enough to keep one's appetite going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The accompanying salad and bread also went well with the meat, and he could have eaten as much as he wanted by mixing them with the meat juices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After finishing one dish after another, I realized that there was not a single piece of meat, not even a drop of gravy, left on the plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you very much for the food," he said. "It was really delicious!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  who  had  finished  the  meal  in  no  time  at  all,  thanked  the  chefs,  and  Hanna  and  Ena laughed with happy faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's okay, you don't have to worry about it. Besides, you ate it so deliciously, it must have been worth it. That's right. What was he thinking when he suddenly called me out and slashed at me? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My husband is now disciplining that fool so that he won't do such a foolish thing anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I myself don't care anymore, so it's fine. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual "I'm not a fan of the way you do it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">he felt like he had been cajoled into it with a few objects, but it seemed that Mars did not know that Nozomu was a dragon slayer, and he was happy if the matter was settled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad to hear that," he said. "Ena-chan, I'm sorry, but it's almost time for more guests to arrive, so why don't you help my husband?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but it's almost time for more guests to arrive." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hanna urges Ena to clear away the empty plates and sends her back to the kitchen to see if there is more to talk about. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-199"></a>She then asks if there is more to talk about, and Hannah urges Ena to clear the empty plate and returns to the kitchen. "Can I talk to you for a moment ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an air of hesitation, Hanna glances at the others, as if she is paying attention to what is going on around her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Emm, What is it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm talking about that girl, Maru-bo and Ena-chan. What do you think of them?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilted his head, not understanding the meaning of the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Hannah looked at Nozomu with a somewhat serious expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The well-dressed landlady's gaze made Nozomu think once more with his hand on his chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'...... I see. I just met Ena-chan a while ago, so I can't say anything about her, but I thought she was a solid girl. I think she was influenced by Mars." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for Ena, Nozomu does not know much about her, partly because he has just met her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was easy to imagine that she had grown up to be such a strong child under the influence of the bad-behaved Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know ...... much about Mars, to be honest. He didn't think well of me, and he didn't try to hide  it.  However,  I  had  a  feeling  that  his  attitude  toward  me  had  been  changing  somewhat recently,......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  himself had noticed a change in  Mars' attitude since the mock battle at  the end of the second school year, but he did not know the reason for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. ...... I knew it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean by 'I knew it'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The first thing that comes to mind is that the first time you see a person in the marketplace, you know the reason that they're going to be in the market for a new product. But after listening to what he had to say, I understood why" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The reason?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, well. But I was relieved. he still had someone he could be friends with" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......, what does that mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hannah speaks happily, but Nozomu doubts her words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he had become more mature recently, it was hard to believe that they could be friends, at least considering Mars' reaction to Nozomu up to now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-200"></a>"he didn't say he didn't want you to come here. I don't think he'll say it, but he wants to be friends with  you.  He's  been  behaving  pretty  badly  in  the  past,  and  he  doesn't  have  any  experience apologizing to people himself, so I guess he doesn't know how to apologize ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">From what I've heard, Mars has never once brought his cronies or the ruffians he associates with to this restaurant. This surprised Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mind recalled Mars' appearance at the outer edge of the restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu accused Mars of slashing at him, he looked uncomfortable and seemed to be at a loss to say anything. Perhaps he wanted to apologize to Nozomu for all the bad things he had done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Does he at least know that what he is doing is wrong? Maybe he's not as bad as we thought?) At least for Nozomu, who has been shaken up enormously by Mars and his cronies, his actions to keep his family out of his doings seemed new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, having seen a side of him that he did not know at the school, Nozomu can no longer simply say that Mars is a delinquent who is incapable of feeling people's pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was eating Hanna's food, in the kitchen, Mars was frantically washing the pile of dishes he had been given as punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to him, a huge man, taller than the lanky Mars, was silently waving a frying pan over the fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant man's name is Del Dickens. He is Hannah's husband and the owner of this restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars had been lectured by Hanna until just a few minutes ago, but he was finally released from the lecture when Del finished cooking a dish for Nozomu and she went to deliver it to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as punishment, Hannah had hit him on the head with a frying pan, and Mars had a large bump on his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God damn it, how long are you going to keep doing this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing what Mars had done to Nozomu, Del was stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  was  so  disgusted  by  what  Mars  had  done  to  Nozomu  that  he  had  no choice  but  to  shut  his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is he the one who's been acting strange with you lately?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ensuing silence and awkwardly averted gaze told us that Del's point was spot on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He, Nozomu, you say? From the looks of you, you probably lost to him, didn't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-201"></a>Mars is surprised at the fact that he has been told the truth. He had told them that he had followed Nozomu and that they had fought, but he had never told anyone about his victory or defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Mars let out an upset voice, Del let out a big sigh as if to say, "What the heck is going on?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many  years do  you think I've been  your parental figurehead? I don't care how much  you hate that you lose" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why are you so pissed off?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I just wanted to know why he was so strong. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His pride is one thing, but he also has a sense that he is the one to protect them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, his dark past has made him strongly reluctant to show his innermost feelings to others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even Mars, who cannot be honest, sometimes opens his heart to Del to some extent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Mars, Del is an irreplaceable family member, a dependable father, and in a sense, one of his goals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though they were not related to each other by blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  that's  the  case,  why  don't  you  just  say  so?  Why  don't  you  just  ask  him  about  it  from  the beginning?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think I can ask him that now. The actuality fact that the particulars are not really that simple to understand" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  words  of  resignation  leaked  out  of  Mars'  mouth.  The  weak  and  carefree  appearance  was something he would never show to anyone other than his father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, you were aware that you were a delinquent, weren't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The father laughed off his son's voice as if to say, "What's the matter with you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you making fun of me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I just thought you might have bumb in your head, seeing you like this all the time" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course not!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're my son and I'm proud of you for being able to go to the highest school in the Solminati, and then you stumble and swoon over the slightest little thing like this. You really haven't changed, have you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-202"></a>He laughs at his son's good points, bad points, and mistakes with a silly joke, and accepts them without confirming or denying them. The parental love that lies behind these words is that they are watching you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Del knew. He knew that his son was not a fundamentally evil person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars had dealt with bad people before, but he had never crossed the line that he really shouldn't have crossed, even though he was strong and pouty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Mars never opened up to anyone but his family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither Hannah nor Del were Mars and Ena's real parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hannah and Del took them in after their mother died and their father abandoned them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This past still casts a shadow over the siblings' hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why Del was happy that Mars brought an acquaintance of his own age to this restaurant, despite his guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps he could become a friend to this twisted son. Despite these hopes, Del tells Mars to do what he has to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, at least make sure you apologize properly for what you did to him" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, I know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He replies in a blunt tone, but his voice has regained some of its power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The interior of Ushiro-Tei was deserted when Nozomu visited, but as the darkness fell, it gradually became filled with the hustle and bustle that is typical of a bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been completely satisfied with his meal, decided that it would be a bad idea to stay too long seeing that the number of customers was increasing, so he decided to leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry to have bothered you. The food was delicious" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry about it. It was my son who caused the trouble" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu thanked her in front of the restaurant, the well-dressed proprietress laughed and waved her hand, telling him not to worry about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come again, you ate quite well. It was worth the effort" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san," she said. "I'm afraid my brother may cause you trouble again, but I'm counting on you" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Del smiled a smile that did not suit his stern face, and Ena bowed to Nozomu once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-203"></a>"Look, Mars. You're the one who caused all this trouble, so make sure you get him back to his dormitory" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a poke from Hannah, Mars steps forward, his mouth agape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu almost blew up at Mars, who had a bump on his head, but he bowed to Hannah and the others and headed home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  of  them  proceeded  side  by  side  on  their  way  back  to  the  dormitory  in  an  unobtrusive manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the way, both Nozomu and Mars were silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until now, Mars had only cursed at Nozomu, and Nozomu had never had a proper conversation with Mars, so it was not surprising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Mars who spoke first, breaking the silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ...... I'm sorry ...... for all the things I've said to you" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scratching his cheek, Mars awkwardly utters an apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if he apologizes up front, Nozomu will take it into consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  feelings  swirling  in  the  pit  of  his  stomach,  Nozomu  now  understands  that  Mars  is bowing his head in sincere apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is now able to understand that Mars is truly sorry and is bowing to him. It's okay now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. Thanks. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The line of Nozomu accepting the apology, Mars lets out a breath of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, seeing his own sister curse him so meta-disparagingly was one of the factors that led Nozomu to relax his detachment from Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of Mars's hideous behavior replaying in his mind's eye almost brought a chuckle to his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Didn't you just think something strange?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, perhaps sensing Nozomu's disquiet with his animal instincts, asks with a jittery look, "What did you think just now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was just wondering if it's human to further blame someone who was so torn apart by his own sister,...... ps." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Nozomu couldn't hold back and unintentionally let out a laugh that he had been choking back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-204"></a>"Oh, you! You just laughed at me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll never forget it. I might even laugh remembering it from now on. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of Nozomu giggling, perhaps remembering his own ugliness, caused Mars' face to turn bright red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You, forget it, Forget it immediately! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey! What are you doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars is shamelessly coming at him, and Nozomu is desperately trying to escape from his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two ranting and raving people echoed through the commercial district at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, the bustle in this area does not disappear even at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then I realized that both Nozomu and Mars had forgotten all the reserve they felt for each others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Nozomu felt nostalgia and joy at such an unreserved exchange. He had only one person with whom he could make noise like this without worrying about his surroundings, and that was his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  of  them  were  walking  around,  shouting  in  the  midst  of  the  bustle  of  the  commercial district. No matter how you looked at them, they looked like two good friends who were on bad terms with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-205"></a>It has been a few days since reconciled with Mars. During that time, Nozomu's treatment in class had changed considerably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is because Mars, who disliked Nozomu the most, began to talk to him more often. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Students in the tenth grade are basically ignored and treated with contempt by students in all other class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one of the downsides of Solminati Academy, which claims to be a thorough meritocracy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only outlet for these students who were treated as dropouts was Nozomu, who was always at the bottom of the class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, now that Mars, who is in the tenth grade but is comparable to the top of the class in terms of ability, is talking with Nozomu, those who had been cursing Nozomu cannot touch him anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, the students who had been relieving their stress with Nozomu no longer directly touch him, but only glare at him from afar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars also began to distance himself from his cronies, who had been around until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, his cronies had only gathered around him unilaterally, and as soon as he became involved with Nozomu, they immediately disappeared from the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars began to become involved with Nozomu in practical classes and other activities, and inevitably, the two spent more time together at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri, who had been worried about Nozomu, who had always been alone, was delighted by this fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm so happy~! Nozomu-kun and Mars-kun became good friends ～～～～!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That day, Nozomu was dragged by Anri and they had lunch together in the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, Mars was also in the infirmary, having been dragged by Anri in the same way as Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri's tension was at its climax right from the start, and he was more than ever in a happy mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hai, here. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Paedon me ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was a little taken back by Anri's too high tension. Mars was looking pouty and was chomping on his sandwich for lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, well. Anri is happy, too, that Nozomu-kun and Mars-kun are now friends. Anri was concerned not only about Nozomu-kun, but also about Mars-kun. She even told me he wasn't really a bad boy" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-206"></a>Next to a delighted Anri, Norn, the master of the infirmary, is likewise bringing the lunch he has prepared to his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What does that mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Mars looked a little surprised at Norn's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been only a few days since Anri had become the homeroom teacher of the tenth grade, and Mars was too notorious as a delinquent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In such a situation, he himself could not believe that Anri had made such an assessment of Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because~~. Mars-kun, since the end of the second grade, you stopped making fun of Nozomu-kun like the other kids. Besides, it seems that you have reflected on what you did to Nozomu-kun and made peace with it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri herself replies to Mars' question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her words firmly pointed out the change in Mars from the end of the second grade to the beginning of the third grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast to her slow, natural behavior, Anri's precise observations made Mars fall silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He can't be that bad, can he?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is hard to imagine from her usual words and actions, but this woman is also a talented young woman who was appointed as a teacher at this school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, on the other hand, turned away, but her face was red and it was obvious that she was embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the door to the infirmary rattled open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me, Norn-sensei, are you there?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah,......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entering the room was a beautiful girl with long, shiny black hair and deep jet-black eyes. It was Irisdina Francilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have a wounded student. Could you please treat her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's gaze caught Nozomu, who was having lunch in the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that comes to mind is the awkward goodbye in the central park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's been a while,......, Nozomu-kun" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, uh, yeah, ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sharp gaze of Irisdina pierced through Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-207"></a>The sudden and intense pressure on Nozomu's face made his face twitch as cold sweat poured down his forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emotions that welled up in her chest at the unexpected reunion were both joy at finally meeting each other and tantrums at being so impatient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, from the end-of-year examinations of the second grade to the time of her promotion, she was also very busy and did not have a chance to meet with Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself had not had much time to spare due to the death of his master and supplementary examinations, but Irisdina's sense of freedom after the busyness of daily life and the sudden reunion with Nozomu had also caused her to lose her self-control for a short period of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A heavy atmosphere filled the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiles at Nozomu, but her eyes do not smile at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only Nozomu, but even Anri, who usually exudes a sunny cheerfulness, was silent in the face of the silent pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oi, hey, Nozomu, you know each other? What the hell did you do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun~, what on earth did you do? I won't get mad, just tell sensei what you did" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars tapped Nozomu on the shoulder and looked at him suspiciously. Anri also questioned Nozomu in a gentle tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What comes back to Nozomu's mind is that she was asked about the rift with Lisa and the circumstances he did not want to be mentioned by in the central park, and he unintentionally raised his voice and walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he think back on it, Nozomu realize that she had not said or done anything to blame him, but simply that Nozomu had gotten mad on his own and walked away on his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how mad he was, it was not the kind of attitude one should have toward a stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know…, I have behaved in a way that, um, might have offended her a little......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, this is a weak reason for Irisdina to show so much tantrum It is true that Nozomu's attitude is not complimentary, but Nozomu and Irisdina are hardly friends in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Irisdina are not people who have any trust or confidence in each other, and Nozomu believes that they are not in a relationship where emotions can move them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-208"></a>On the other hand, Irisdina's cheeks twitched every time Nozomu and his friends whispered to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, Ai, now there's an injured person......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, from behind Irisdina, her best friend, Tima Raim, called out to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She lends a shoulder to a female student who appears to be injured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, right, I'm sorry. Norn-sensei, we have an injured student. Can you help us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. First of all, put the injured student in that chair." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the sound of her best friend's voice, Irisdina's anger instantly subsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Norn's urging, Tima sat the injured female student on the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The female student is bleeding considerably from her hand and arm, and Norn quickly begins examining the injured student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also offers to help, taking medicines and bandages from the shelves and arranging them on the examination table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He's, too, is a frequent visitor to the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a general idea of which injuries require which medicines and where they are kept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What happened ～～～～" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri was asking Irisdina and the others about the situation on behalf of Norn, who was treating the injured students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that you are not the only one who can help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, you certainly lost a lot of blood, but fortunately there's nothing wrong with your bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The muscles also seem to be fine. I'll use recovery magic and medicine just in case. If the discomfort doesn't disappear after a few days, come back again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying this, Anri quickly patches up the wound with potions and recovery magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu watches Anri's treatment, her eyes meet those of her escort, Tima Raim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as her eyes meet Nozomu's, she looks away and hides behind Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had heard from Irisdina that Tima is not good with men, smiles at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Mars frowns at the sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He crosses his arms and gives Tima and Irisdina a sly glare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiiiii......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' intimidation causes Tima to let out a small scream, but Mars does not like the sight of her being intimidated, and his gaze becomes even sharper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>Tima is even more frightened by Mars's obviously unhappy expression, and a vicious cycle occurs in which Mars's expression becomes even more rigid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars, calm down. What's wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your own place is to be a good friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discomfort towards Tima. The reason for Mars' feelings about this was her frightened attitude itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is a grade A student, which is above Mars' rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is one of the few people in this school who is definitely one of the best in the third grade, which is a testimony to her strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars also has a high pride in her strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, despite the fact that she sits at the highest rank in this school, A rank, she is not allowed to appear frightened and shrinking herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Tima is unaware of Mars' beliefs. To her, Mars, who is much bigger than her and was known as a delinquent, is an object of more fear than a demonic beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, does not release the same kind of tantrum towards Nozomu as she did earlier, but she looks at him as if she wants to say something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Tima-san is still scared of me, but what's happen to Irisdina-san?) Nozomu inwardly tilts his head at Irisdina's attitude, whose intentions he cannot read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While there is a delicate atmosphere on both sides, the injured schoolgirls have been treated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's done. She should rest for a while." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, thank you very much. Um, senpai, too. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girls thanked Norn for treating them and Irisdina and the others for carrying her here, and bowed deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, don't worry about it" As the doctor said, "it would be better to refrain from magic training for a while and rest for the time being" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The female student who raises her voice is looking up at Irisdina with a sparkling gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that some of the underclassmen, who were probably friends of the female student, were also looking longingly at Irisdina from outside the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Irisdina bows her head once again to Norn, who treated the female students. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-210"></a>Even though they are not close friends, they are neatly thanking the person who saved an injured person, brought him to the infirmary and treated him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watching her like this, Nozomu was reminded once again that she is a person of outstanding character and at the same time the object of admiration of many students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The injured girl then returns to the classroom with her friends who were waiting outside the infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Nozomu-kun, for helping out too" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the underclassmen are gone, Irisdina calls out to Nozomu, as if she had been waiting for that moment. The anger from earlier has all but disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, don't think about it, I just happened to be here too. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She suddenly thanked him and Nozomu scratched his cheek as if embarrassed. As if caught by Nozomu, Irisdina also smiled a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heavy air that had been flowing between the two of them just a few minutes ago became a little lighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had been in the middle of a conversation with Nouzou, smiled a little and said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun...... may I talk to you for a while?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps encouraged by the lightened atmosphere, Irisdina showed little hesitation, then said she wanted to talk to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, is it okay here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, if possible, I would like to talk in a place where no one else is ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then you can use the storage room. The storage room is a closed room for storing chemicals" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu opened the door to the storage room, wondering what on earth she want to talking about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu entered the room, not only Irisdina but also Tima came into the room with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, she too has something she wants to talk to Nozomu about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room, which can only be entered through the infirmary, has shelves tightly placed on all four walls and inside the room, where various medicines such as disinfectants, potions, and antidotes are stored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are no windows or other openings in the room to prevent deterioration due to sunlight, and the room is lit only by a magic lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This magic lamp is one of the magical tools developed in Alkazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-211"></a>This magical tool, which provides constant light, is more stable in light intensity than the lanterns and wax candles that had been used until then, and is more convenient, as it does not deteriorate easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic lanterns themselves have been made and used in many countries, but the unit price per unit is relatively high, and they are not suitable for mass production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason, even in Alkazam, they are only used in a very few facilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the pale light of the magic lamp, Nozomu, Irisdina, and Tima face each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was the first to open her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wanted to apologize" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When we had lunch with Somia. I'm sorry ...... for asking you such rude questions without taking into account your situation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself was aware that it was not polite to walk away suddenly, no matter how much he was asked about a situation he did not want to be reminded of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first place, she was going to add at the end of her words that she did not care about the rumors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, it was Nozomu who walked away, having mistakenly thought that she was the one to apologize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, it's ....... It is rather me who should apologize. I'm sorry for being rude. I was trying to have a proper conversation with you, but I made a one-sided assumption and then walked away......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time he saw Irisdina, who was bowing to him, Nozomu was stunned for a few seconds, but then he came to his senses and hurriedly added a few words of apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad to hear you say that," she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I am sorry again" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first timeNozomu saw her, he was so impressed with the way she looked at him that he had to stop hisself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since further discussion could lead to a watering down of the issue, both parties accepted each other's apologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the conversation with Irisdina, Nozomu's gaze shifted to Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Tima," she said, "you can go too......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uwawa, I wanted to apologize to you too ....... You helped me in the forest, but I made you feel bad about it. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-212"></a>Tima also wanted to apologize to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina put her hand on Tima's shoulder as if to help her best friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Nozomu-kun. Tima has a bit of a problem with men.  I was holding up a little because I was listening to your rumors" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, that, I don't mind. I got a proper apology now, and it's reasonable if you've heard rumors about me. ......"" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is certainly not surprising if you have heard the rumors about Nozomu. If he was dating a famous girl in his grade at the time, but was dumped after having an affair with her, no one would have a good impression of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Nozomu remembered Lisa's unchanged attitude, and felt a pain deep in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(it's really painful …………) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's surroundings are beginning to change, albeit gradually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Although I was saddened by the death of Shisho, I made new friends) Unlike before, he now has a homeroom teacher at the school who sees him properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little by little, more and more people began to see him as he is now, not as the image of Nozomu spread by rumor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the image of his former lover and the countless taunts he receives still haunt him, along with the pain he still feels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'm running away, after all. Every time I remember all the things I've turned away from, this is what I get. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has not completely gotten over his broken heart with Lisa or the hurt of being scorned until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's just that as he met Somia, Irisdina and the others, reconciled with Mars, and formed new relationships, he naturally had fewer opportunities to remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... something wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing. Shall we go back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they returned to the infirmary, Mars, Anri, and Norn were waiting for Nozomu and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're back" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, could you introduce them to me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-213"></a>"Oh, He's Mars Dickens, a classmate of mine. The brown-haired one is our homeroom teacher, Anri-sensei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to meet you" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to meet you too" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anri replies to Nozomu's introduction with a big smile and a friendly tone. She knows Irisdina and the others, but they have never met before due to the different classes they are in charge of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, on the other hand, was looking at Irisdina and the others like a stray dog with a pouty smile on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was not at all interested in them. It was the same Mars as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Hannah, he is more mature now than he used to be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see, it looks like a friend with a very rugged temperament." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, uh that ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even under the intimidating gaze of Mars, Irisdina coolly and nonchalantly passed it off with a cool face and replied with an esprit effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu would like to say that she is indeed a black-haired princess, but unfortunately, there is someone here who is not very good at rough men like her. Needless to say, it was Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only she's not good with men to begin with, but Mars is tall and broad-shouldered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The way he was shoving his hands in her pockets while scattering a moody air in all directions was completely that of a delinquent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, Tima hid behind Irisdina's back again to escape Mars' gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiiiii......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tch" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A vicious cycle between Mars and Tima was about to start again, and Nozomu rebuked Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars took his eyes off Tima, and with an aura of ill humor emanating from his entire body, he moved away from the group and sat down near the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A heavy air flowed between Nozomu and Irisdina and the others again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yes, that's right. Nozomu-kun, there is actually a birthday party for Somia coming up soon" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdinana tried to change the mood of the event by broaching a different topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The content was about her sister Somia's birthday party. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-214"></a>Nozomu was surprised at the abruptness of the topic, but remembered something he had heard from Somia herself earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Ah, come to think of it, Somia-chan said something like that" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, some of Somia's classmates will be among the participants, and we'd love to have you there too" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, if it's a birthday party for the daughter of the Francilt family, there should be high-profile people coming from all over the place. Is it really okay for me to go to such a place?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Francilt family is a well-known family in many countries on the Arkmill continent. The Francilt family is a well-known and respected family on the Arkmill continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, Nozomu has a bad reputation at the Solminati Academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina, the woman in question, laughed off Nozomu's unfounded fears as if she didn't care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't mind," she said. Irisdina, the designer of the party, laughed off the rumors as if she did not care about it, "And Nozomu is a friend of Somia's, isn't he? No problem" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no lie or deception in her expression as she puts her hand over her mouth and smiles slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the bottom of her heart, she wished and invited Nozomu to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, will you come?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I understand. I will come" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad. I'm sure Somia will be happy to hear that" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing of Nozomu's participation, Irisdina's smile deepened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And her gaze suddenly turned to Mars, who was standing next to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She then turned to Mars, who was standing next to Nozomu, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, how about you too, Mars-kun?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"ee, eh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's sudden words made Mars sound dumbfounded and Tima look surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He don't know what she is talking about. Mars' gaze then turned to Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars has just a few moments ago turned a look akin to hostility toward her friend. Normally, he would not have invited such a person to his sister's birthday party. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-215"></a>"What are you thinking? Are you serious? I've never been friends with your sister, let alone you two. I've never even met your sister" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yes. You've certainly never met., but you seem to be a friend of Nozomu-kun. Isn't it strange to invite you separately?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's expression shows no dislike toward Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She just has a meaningful smile on her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps her composure was annoying, but Mars frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, I'm not the right person for a classy aristocrat's party" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, yes. I've heard a good deal about you, Mars Dickens. I've only spoken to you briefly, but you certainly seem to have the personality to cause trouble wherever you go. But ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's gaze glanced at Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you with him on your lunch break? It's an unlikely combination, I would think. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering Mars' personality, there is no way he would be with Nozomu, who is at the bottom of his class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in reality, this is how they spend the most precious time of the day, lunchtime, together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most obvious traits of a person is his or her hidden temperament, which cannot be seen at first glance. One of the things that most clearly reflects this is friendship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People instinctively tend to make friends with people who are similar to them or who share the same goals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This means that Nozomu and Mars, both of whom have completely different personalities and appearances, have something in common or can relate to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, from Irisdina's point of view, Mars has a rough personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unlike Tima, who is trembling at her back, Irisdina, who as an aristocratic daughter has dealt with a thousand and one big aristocrats in the social world, sensitively sensed the shadow of Mars' hidden temperament behind his rough mannerisms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You may be as martial and impudent as you look, but I think you are at least a reasonable man, don't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Irisdina's words, Mars' gaze finally turned hostile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, Mars is a loner wolf who does not like to be interfered with by others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the hostility shown by Mars indicates that Irisdina's point is correct, and Nozomu was amazed at her insight into his temperament in such a short period of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-216"></a>"And it's easy to understand. Like a lonely stray dog,......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had seen through Mars's temperament, also threw a provocative remark at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "You've got a lot to say ......, don't you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you don't speak well, you can't socialize. It's an inevitability of birth. Of course, you can refuse this invitation on your own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina lightly brushed off Mars' hostility with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tch........" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, Mars could not say anything back to this and had no choice but to look away and shut his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, Mars is an intuitive person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, and one more thing. If you come, I would like to host you and make you feel welcome to the maximum extent. And I'm sure you'll enjoy the food" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Irisdina left the infirmary with Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars, will you come?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I'm won't come!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars dismissed Nozomu's question with lightning speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu shrugged his shoulders at the commonplace response, "I knew you'd say that" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But then again, you've been poking at Tima-san for quite a while" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' attitude toward Tima was clearly excessive. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is the most irritating person I've ever met. He's strong, but he's so shy............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think that being strong is enough to be afraid of everything. Sometimes we feel fear because we have too much power. He has such strong magical power. He may have been through a lot in the past" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Norn repeated the words in response to Mars' voice, which sounded as if he was about to throw up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were so insightful that Mars fell silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Too much power, huh? ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, felt deep sympathy and anxiety at the words of fear due to strong power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Subconsciously, the hand on his chest tightens. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-217"></a>The invisible chains that clung to his body made a creaking, grating sound in Nozomu's strong hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">After school, Nozomu and Mars had come to Ushiro-tei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lately, Nozomu has been having dinner here more often than not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He usually cooks for himself to make ends meet, but now that he has become friends with Mars, Ena and Hannah are willing to give him a discount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, Nozomu also feels bad about getting a discount, so he sometimes helps out with the dishes, grocery shopping, carrying in, and other manual labor, and as a result they have begun to build a good relationship in which they support each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Onii-chan, what in the world are you doing!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena's angry voice echoes through the sunset light of the Ushiro-tei restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena noticed Mars coming home with a grim face and questioned him, and it was because she found out about his exchange with Irisdina in the infirmary and the fact that he had lash up on Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you so quick to lash out at people, onii-chan!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up! Why the hell are you messing with me! It's none of your business!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's my business! What were you going to do if Hannah and the others got in trouble again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's see......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Ena are arguing with each other. Nozomu, who was sitting at the same table as Mars, was completely out of the loop, not knowing what to do, and could only scratch his cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry about it. It's an everyday occurrence for both of us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hannah-san......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hannah emerges from the kitchen in the back of the restaurant and places a plate of food and milk in front of Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They'll be back to normal tomorrow, so there's no point in worrying about it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a quick snap, Hannah cocks her chin as if urging Nozomu on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead of her gaze, there are several customers who have already visited the restaurant, but everyone only smiles wryly as they watch the hustle and bustle in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why do you always go off on tangents like that, Onii-chan? Maybe you has fallen in love with that Tima-san? How childish of you to try to get her attention by being mean to her! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-218"></a>"I don't feel that way! Don't invent my feelings without my permission!" </p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-0">
<p class="calibre1">Despite the relaxed atmosphere around them, the argument between the two grew more heated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The volume was so loud that the windows of the inn shook and ripples appeared in Nozomu's glass of milk. To put it bluntly, the noise was so loud that one could be convinced that the demon beasts were fighting each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But the customers are not moving at all. ............ how much?) Even in such a state, the surrounding customers are unchanged. Seeing that the military police did not rush to the scene even after all this commotion, it seems that even the military police are aware of the quarrel between the siblings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is it the local residents who are surprised that they are able to act normally in the midst of such a huge commotion, or is it the siblings who have allowed such a scene to be recognized as normal? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bakiiii! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu was stunned by the reactions of those around him, a loud noise suddenly rang out from the two fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the heck!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked in the direction of the noise and saw Ena lifting a chair from the counter and slamming it on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell are you doing out of the blue?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've already realized that it doesn't matter what I say to Onii-chan! I'm going to make you understand by using force. Prepare yourself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena grabbed the legs of the chair with both hands and held it in the upright position. Her posture was strangely elegant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaahhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena swung the chair down at Mars' head. Mars hurriedly avoids the swinging chair, but his face twitches as the chair runs past his face at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're killing me! If it was a little late, my brain would be cracked!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu inwardly agreed with Mars' desperate plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though the chair was made of wood, a blow to the head from the corner of the chair could have been devastating if the blow had hit the wrong part of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if you stare at Mars, whom Nozomu just barely avoided, you can feel the presence of heightened qi from his body. It seems that he even used body reinforcement to avoid Ena's blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(... Wait a minute. What does it mean for Marus, who has strengthened his body, to avoid it?) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-219"></a>Nozomu felt a strange sense of discomfort, and upon closer inspection of Ena's condition, he could feel the presence of heightened qi in her body as well. It seems that she is unconsciously using body enhancement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Huh? I'm pretty sure I heard that Ena-chan doesn't have any physical enhancement or other combat training. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Hannah and others, Ena has never acquired any combat skills or the like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, as a matter of reality, one can clearly sense a presence from her body due to the strengthening of her qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing how she is unconsciously strengthening her body, even though she has not received any particular combat training, she may have considerable talent, just like Mars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or rather, as Nozomu, I would like to tell her not to hit her immediate family with so much enhanced physical ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how bad Mars' conduct may have been in the past, he was too unrefined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Even if it was unconscious, Mars really would have died if he had done poorly. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute! You always tell me not to be violent, but you resort to violence yourself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Well, that's a reasonable line from Mars, who was almost killed. ............) Now Mars was completely cowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena is now fourteen years old, not exactly tall, and has the body of a very normal girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the spirit she wore now completely dominated the place. If this situation continues, Mars could really be killed. Nozomu thought that would be bad, and raised her voice to appease Emma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No matter how much Mars as helpless delinquent, this is indeed a bad idea......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't interrupt me, Nozomu-san! This is the only way to rehabilitate Onii-chan now! Perhaps a shock will turn him into a decent character!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, no! Before we get to that, Mars' head will be useless in another way! Let's just calm down!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu is desperately trying to quiet Ena down, if you look at Mars, he is violently shaking his head up and down as if agreeing with Nozomu's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, Mars also realizes that Ena's current state is not good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No! If I don't do something to make my brother decent here, I will surely regret it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, no! I'm sure I'll regret it if I don't do something about him!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-220"></a>Ena again raises her chair and tries to jump on him, but Nozomu tries to stop her by pinning her down from behind, but he is almost swatted away by the strength of Ena, whose body has been strengthened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa, too powerful" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is also using body reinforcement, but Ena's body reinforcement is unconscious, so there is no adjustment at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual Mars, by the way, had completely lost his will to fight and was cornered in a corner of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the side, it was a scene of a little domestic violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A child being violated by a violent husband and a wife trying to stop him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, the violent husband is Ena and the child is Mars. The wife who is trying to stop it is Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the guests, who are supposed to be witnessing such a scene, are used to it by now and are laughing hysterically with a mug of sake in their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From their point of view, it is probably a comedy in which they can only think that they have been cast incorrectly. The performers themselves, however, are quite serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Mars was hit in the brain by a blow from Ena's chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, because Nozomu struggled to resist the blow, the force of the downward strike was dampened. Mars managed to avoid being bludgeoned to death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, he was completely knocked up, and Hannah dragged him back to his room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena, who had purged Mars in the name of rehabilitation, was completely unperturbed by his actions and returned to serving customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Yeah, let's not piss Ena-chan off.......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Witnessing such a scene in the Dickens household, Nozomu had one rule in his mind that he must not forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the reason Ena had become so agitated was because of Mars, who had been causing her a great deal of stress on a regular basis, and in the end, it was his own fault. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was lost in thought as he walked back to the student dormitory after leaving Ushiro-tei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What should I do about the present?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, a birthday party means presents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-221"></a>In Nozomu's mind, the face of Somia, whom he had met in the central park, came to mind. The first thing that comes to mind is the smile on her face as she thinks about what to give her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was wearing a distinctive arm ornament, by the way" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The armlet she said her sister had given her was a rather expensive item, but more than that, Somia seemed happy that it was a gift from her dear sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The value of a gift is not determined solely by the monetary value of the item. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If she thought of it that way, it seemed Nozomu could handle it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I hope it's not too late" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The night was already falling, and Nozomu turned on his heel and started walking in the opposite direction from the dormitory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The destination was Shino's hut in the Spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After running through the forest in the darkness, he arrives at the hut and begins rummaging through it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, There it is," he finds among the shelves, a bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had originally belonged to Shino and had been one of her trinkets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was made of brass, small in shape, and made a quiet chirping sound when shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder if I can make something like this with the tools in the shed. "I'm sorry, Shisho, but I'm going to use something you have" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He strips off brass parts from the unused tools in the hut and throws them into the fireplace to heat them up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He makes two metal balls to serve as beads and four hemispherical parts, wraps the beads with the hemispherical parts, crimps them together, and glues the threading rings to the finished bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, borrowing a shino sash dyed indigo, reweave it into a bracelet shape. Finally, the bell and bracelet are tied together with thread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu shakes the completed bell as a test. The bell, which makes a rather irregular sound, is not as good as the bell he used as a reference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I guess I can't make it right in the first time, Let's try a little more" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying this, Nozomu threw the brass into the furnace once more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, he continued to work on the bell until dawn, but was unable to produce the bell he had hoped for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the morning sun shone on the hut, Nozomu had no choice but to head back to the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-222"></a>He spent the rest of the day working on the bell and continued to struggle with the brass parts until the day before Somia's birthday party. </p>
