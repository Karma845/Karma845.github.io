 <h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Meet The Forest Hermit and The Beginning</h3>
 
<p class="calibre1">The school city of Arcazam is a very new city, built about ten years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city was built with funds and technology contributed by the countries of the Arkmill continent, with the Soluminati Academy at its center, with each district built around it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Solminati Academy, its affiliated organizations, and research facilities were built in the center, while the political institutions, including the administrative offices that governed the city's politics, and the wealthy aristocrats from each country who organized these political institutions lived in the northern part of the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eastern part of the city is the civic district, where the dormitories of the students belonging to the academy and many ordinary citizens live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The southern part of the city is the commercial district, where merchants and goods gather from all over the world, forming the center of the city's economy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is also an adventurers' guild, where students can get jobs depending on their rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The western part of the city is the craftsmen's district, where many artisans gather. Blacksmiths, craftsmen, sewers, and other craftsmen who make use of the skills of their respective countries are engaged in the daily struggle for success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside  the  city,  a  large  highway  runs  through  the  southern  part  of  the  city,  and  narrow  paths continue to the north, east, and west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, outside of the roads, dense forests spread out, preventing people from entering the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also  known  as  the  Blank  Forest,  this  forest  was  originally  a  buffer  zone  between  two  major powers, the Cremazone Empire and the Kingdom of Forsyna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was a land that no country claimed ownership of, due to the fact that powerful demonic beasts inhabited the deep forest, there is a history of urban areas and roads being cut through the land for the construction of Arcazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The forest is inhabited by various types of demonic beasts, ranging from those that can be defeated by ordinary people to those that are so powerful that even seasoned adventurers have a hard time keeping up with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-35"></a>However,  the  powerful  beasts  are  generally  found  deep  in  the  forest  and  do  not  appear  in  the vicinity of towns and roads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in such a forest. In a corner of the forest, surrounded by tall trees like giants, there stands a hut that seems to be hidden from the public eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, the place would have been silent, with only the rustling of leaves and the neighing of beasts to be heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, however, there was the high-pitched sound of hard metal crashing against metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The source of the sound was two shadows striking each other in front of the hut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One is the school dropout, Nozomu Bountis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other is an old woman who, like Nozomu, carries an Eastern sword in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hair has completely lost its color and grayed out, and the wrinkles are etched into the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her name is Shino, and she has clearly reached the age of old age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them are wielding the same weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both wielded genuine, unsharpened swords, not the imitation swords used at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both wielded their swords without hesitation, weapons that would surely inflict serious wounds on their opponents if they made the wrong move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geeeeeeeeeeeeeee! The swords collide with each other with a spark, and Nozomu's body is swept backward by the impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gghh ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hm, not enough. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old woman quickly stepped in and swung her fist mercilessly at Nozomu's empty cheek, as Nozomu stumbled from the impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gosh ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's vision went dark as his head was shaken off by the blow. His upper body then flows to the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively pulls his arms around his body as his vision goes dark and rolls his body to prepare for the impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment of impact as half of his body hits the ground, Nozomu rolls on the ground without killing his momentum and tries to stand up as he is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Nozomu can get up, the old woman gives chase and swings down her sword without hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-36"></a>"Damn!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gave up trying to regain his stance. He concentrates his qi on his legs and releases it all at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu shunpei (flash step). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is one of the qi-jutsu in which the qi concentrated in the legs is released and powerful acceleration is obtained instantaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accelerated in an instant, Nozomu runs to Shino's side and attempts to break away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Shino  also  immediately  activated  her  shunpei  in  the  same  way  as  Nozomu.  With  an acceleration far exceeding than Nozomu, she went around the evasion destination, and by the time he noticed her, she had already dropped to her haunches and was in position for an unannounced strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're slow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a voice filled with dismay, the scabbard of Shino's sword, poised at his waist, it cut with a cool kin...... sound. A strong chill ran down Nozomu's neck, and in the next instant, Shino's sword was unsheathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly relaxes both legs and drops his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flash of Shino's sword passed over Nozomu's head with a single paper stroke, slicing through several strands of his hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  a  qi  slash  flies  along  the  sword's  trajectory,  cutting  down  several  large  trees  in  a straight line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qi-jutsu Genmu (Phantom). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A technique in which the sword is covered with extremely compressed qi and released with a high-speed slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The principle is simple, but the extremely compressed qi is difficult to see, and because it flies at an  extremely  high  speed,  it  can  land  almost  instantaneously  when  the  sword  is  drawn  within  a dozen meters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As you can see, the extremely compressed qi has enough cutting power to cut down a large tree, and if a human were to take a serious hit, it would definitely be fatal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-37"></a>As the tree rattles and crumbles, Shino swings his sword down from above Nozomu's head with a return blow. The sword, like the Genmu from earlier, radiated a radiance of extremely compressed qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the swinging  sword, Nozomu  also  put  all  his  strength  into his  own  sword, momentarily tensing the muscles of both legs, which had been relaxed, to catch Shino's slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guin!  A  deafening  crash  sounded,  and  Nozomu  and  Shino  engaged  in  a  close-range swordfight.......compete with each other </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho! Are you suddenly want to kill me? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I want to kill you, I would have done it the moment you tried to run away. " He went out of her way to evade and cut off the carp's mouth for all to see, so it was only natural that hhe should be able to evade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is incensed by the clearly excessive power of the technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, on the other hand, stated without offence that if she had intended to kill him, she would have done so long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old woman was Nozomu's master in the art of swordsmanship, a drifter who had drifted to this forest before the construction of Arcazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her skills were extraordinary, and despite her advanced age, she was more skilled than any other person Nozomu had ever known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the  guidance of the old  woman,  Nozomu  was  thoroughly trained in her swordsmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Literally, he risked his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, Nozomu had come to be regarded by Shino as "a reasonably good swordsman". </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so, the difference in ability between Shino and Nozomu was obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mun! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of the tsuba, Shino momentarily puts strength into his arms and makes a gesture of trying to push through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  judging  that  it  was  pointless  to  resist  the  momentarily  increased  pressure  with  force, switched his body and tried to pass it off, but at that moment, Shino conversely relaxed the force he had put into his arms and dived into Nozomu's pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh Shi ...... ga!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Nozomu can regain his stance after being caught in a feint, Shino mercilessly mows down Nozomu's legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-38"></a>"Gugu......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino raises her sword in front of Nozomu, who has fallen to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, was on the ground, but took a passive stance and quickly regained his position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  a  kneeling  position,  he  quickly  drew  back  his  sword,  assumed  a  thrusting  stance,  and activated his shunpei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  then  raises  his  sword  and  attempts  to  charge  in  a  straight  line  toward  Shino's  now  empty abdomen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword is raised and he attempts to charge at the empty abdomen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of his disciple's assault, Shino's face contorts for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, Shino's body disappeared from Nozomu's sight, and at the same time, a powerful weight fell on both of his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weight, as if a rock had been placed on top of him, forced the sword he had thrust down, and it pierced the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's over, then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu looked up at Shino's voice, he saw his master thrusting the tip of her sword at his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had sensed the thrust that was about to be made against her, and she had swept her body to the side in time with Nozomu's charge with her blinking legs, and then with her raised foot, she had stomped on the oncoming sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here I come. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  upset  by  his  master's  bizarre  behavior,  but  he  honestly  admitted  defeat  when  the sword was placed along his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming his disciple's surrender, Shino  slowly returns the  sword to the scabbard at his waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was not done yet. It is good that you see an opening in your opponent and act immediately, but you are a little too hasty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho is too strong. Only Shisho can react at such close range. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stands up slowly, knocking dead leaves off his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? You were desperate in your last charge, weren't you, Oh my lord? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your whole body was showing signs of it. It's only natural that she would anticipate you." </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1mQ54NS/000005.jpg" alt="000005" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Nozomu falls silent at Shino's spot-on point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Nozomu did not think he would make it in time either, but his reflexive action made him choose to charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>"Nozomu, it's almost dinner time. While you're running around, go and get some food for dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the end of the instruction. As if to say so, Shino puts his hands on his hips and points to the forest with her finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's routine at the end of a day's training was to do some light running to loosen up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If i can find it, I'll go get it. Only If I can find it. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? When your teacher told you to go get it. You must get it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such a reckless ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no guarantee that you will find the desired food in hunting and gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the look in Shino's eyes as he stared at Nozomu was serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he could not get the side dish, she would give him what he deserved, she said, lifting her eyes and releasing silent pressure with an eerie smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu exhales a sigh at such recklessness from his master and runs off into the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After watching Nozomu's back, Shino's lifted eyebrows changed to a melancholy expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He still has a limp, but it's a little better now. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking of her disciple's back, which is already out of sight, Shino mutters quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In her mind's eye, she recalls the first time she met Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was about a year and a half ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It all started when Shino was searching in the forest and heard the sound of a sword swinging from far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The area around Shino's residence is  close to  Arcazam, but  it is an area inhabited by  relatively powerful demonic beasts, and ordinary people rarely come here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to find out who in the world had come to such a place, I headed toward the place where I had heard the sound, and there I found Nozomu swinging his sword in a frantic manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What in the world was this young fellow doing in the inhospitable forest? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino, who was a little curious, watched him for a while, but Nozomu at that moment was in a terrible state, to say the least. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-41"></a>His complexion was lifeless, his muscles emaciated, and his cheeks hollowed and hollowed like a starving devil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The skin on his hands was torn and peeling, and his joints were inflamed. With each swing of his sword, his body would drift and he would lose his footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was extremely fatigued and malnourished, clearly the result of excessive training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  condition  was  so  bad  that  Shino  interrupted  him,  telling  him  that it was  useless  to  try  any more, but he ignored Shino's warning and showed no sign of stopping his training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It looks thin and looks like a mummy. However, only the black negative emotions emitted from his eyes were pushing the boy's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was abandoned by his girlfriend, blatantly shunned at school, and ridiculed by others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  reality  of  not  being  able  to  return  to  his  hometown  and  the  reality  that  his  future  was completely closed off due to the manifestation of suppression of his abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The extreme stressful environment caused by multiple factors made him act in a desperate manner with a logical breakdown, accumulating meaningless training and self-destructive behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, in his clouded eyes, Shino sees herself falling away from her hometown, and she feels terrible discomfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, "Hmph!" She spat out, and immediately left the place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, she decided to ignore him and did not go near his training place, but as time passed, instead of disappearing, the discomfort increased further and turned into a sense of agitation, as if she was being strangled with a cotton ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes of Nozomu, which kept coming into her head even when she tried not to think about it, made him say, "Oh, God! That little stupid kid!" She went to check on Nozomu and found that he had been attacked by a demonic beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast that attacked Nozomu was a beast-type demonic beast called a wild dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wild  dog  is  a  generic  name  given  to  dog-type  beasts  that  harm  humans,  and  they  are  found throughout the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wild dogs are low-ranked beasts, and although a single wild dog can be defeated by an ordinary person, they are usually found in packs of several to a dozen or more, making them as much of a threat as a dragon to Nozomu, who was at the height of his fatigue at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With extreme fatigue and bleeding from wounds all over his body, Nozomu's movements became sluggish in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-42"></a>The wild dogs then bit down on Nozomu's limbs in an attempt to finish off their slow-moving prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation was hopeless: both limbs were seriously injured, he was pulled down to the ground, and there was no one around to help him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, he was trying to accept that the beasts were tearing him apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With dark resignation and despair in his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he saw this, Shino had stepped into the hunting ground of the Wild Dogs and slashed the heads of every single one of the demonic beasts that had attacked Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa...... geez. What am I crazy to help such a death-hungry man?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shino  faces  Nozomu  with  a  hateful  tone  of  voice,  out  of  frustration  at  being  moved  by  an unpleasant immature person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now, you inexperienced fellow there. Your sword skill is so terrible that I cannot bear to look at it. If you want to die, I'll let you die when you can wield a sword a little better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, there is a possibility that you will die before you can swing it properly. ......," Shino added, smiling provocatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A week later, in front of a cramped hut deep in the forest, there was a boy wielding a katana, not a sword anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A slight spark of life returned to those eyes that had been seeking death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been training him for one and half year since then, just for comfort, and he's ...... turned into one hell of a monster" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from Shino's point of view, Nozomu was getting stronger. That's far beyond her expectations </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does he know what he's doing? What does it mean to be able to go head to head with my sword? </p>
<p class="calibre1">......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the previous mock battle, when Shino fought with Nozomu, what was attached to her sword was a super-compressed qi-sword equivalent to phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a sword that can easily cut through steel just by touching it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Phantom" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-43"></a>A qi-jutsu (qi technique) in which a qi sword is originally released as a qi-sword and is held in the sword to maintain its sharpness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The technique of attaching qi to a weapon itself is a basic technique in qi-jutsu, but because it is basic, there is room for improvement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that Nozomu's qi-sword can compete with Shino's qi-sword means that his qi-sword also boasts the same level of sharpness and density as Shino's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the effects  of ability suppression are taken into account,  his  other body techniques  have also reached a level not so different from Shino's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is extraordinary considering that it has only been a year and a half. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, Nozomu's physical habits were originally suited to using curved swords rather than the straight swords used on the continent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  she  believes  that  what  made  him  strong  was  his  own  efforts  and,  above  all,  his concentration, which kept him committed to the task at hand with everything he had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He may soon give up or lose the will to live again under the rigorous training..I thought so, but that idiot disciple went through with my training" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, he kept only simple gestures all day long and ran through the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The truth, he was attacked by demonic beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She secretly dealt with the ones that were too much for him to handle, but most of the monsters that attacked him, he was able to handle on his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the basics were finished, the next step was a real-life mock battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, Shino put all the skills she had into the nozomu to the extent that he would not die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Broken bones, vomiting, and fainting are commonplace. Even so, Shino never reduced the density of training, but rather had him continue to train harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An ordinary swordsman would have given up in less than a week. But Nozomu endured it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that didn't solve the problem on his mind. He was simply able to avoid looking at it because he continued to focus all his attention on the training in front of him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He meditates on all his problems and devotes himself to training so much that he forgets that he even sought death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, Nozomu's skill in the art of swordsmanship rapidly improved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He no longer suffers any serious injuries, such as broken bones, even when he strikes with Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a>However, the reason why his performance at the academy has not improved despite his skills is due in large part to the suppression of his abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His physical abilities and energy are limited, and he has almost no magic power, and cannot use even elementary magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when he is able to use qi-jutsu to strengthen his abilities, it has little effect, and even when he is able to strengthen them, it is only to the point of being a mere tear in the eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To compensate for this disadvantage, he has improved his swordsmanship and qi control, but the techniques  he  uses  are  inevitably  single-pointed  and  high-powered,  and  their  extremely  high killing power means that they cannot easily be used in school mock battles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, his athleticism was not affected by the suppression of his abilities, and he was able to thoroughly train his body and footwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, because of the low effectiveness of qi-jutsu and other enhancements, it is still not as visible  as  it  should  be,  and  if  the  opponent  strengthens  his  own  abilities  with  magic  or  qi,  the opponent will completely outperform him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It really doesn't work. Besides, the problem is not only the suppression of ability. Above all, there is the problem of the mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another problem that Shino fears is that Nozomu is unaware of his own "escape". </p>
<p class="calibre1">He only trains himself and does not show or flaunt the skills he has acquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They turn their backs on the problems they really need to face, pushing them to the margins of their thinking and not even trying to notice them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a kind of escape from reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The technique that I taught him has a high killing power, but there are many ways to use it if you just want to show your ability. But the reason he's still smoldering is because he has a problem on his own. ....." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not a problem if you just wield a sword, but you will pay the price for putting it off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There will come a time when Nozomu will have to face up to the problems that he has. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you live for, what makes you strong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, the "core of the heart" will be questioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you develop power without a core, you will eventually be swept away by that power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Nozomu's core has already been broken once. He escapes from reality by repeating intense training, and even turns away from escapism itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-45"></a>It  was  not  difficult  for  Shino  to  imagine  that  this  is  why  he  has  an  instinctive  fear  of  human interaction and is isolated even at the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not saying that escaping is bad. But if you turn away from the reality that you are escaping, you will eventually be unable to recover. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the words came out of her mouth unexpectedly, Shino felt a bitter thought leaking out of her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dark past she had hidden inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason why she decided to hide out in this forest also began with what she called "escape". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am not qualified to scold my disciple on that point. That is why ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering the thorn in his chest, Shino resists the urge to scratch his chest by clenching his fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am, all that I have only Mikagura sword style. I will leave it behind. Someday, I will leave it so that my last disciple can break free from his chains. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking back to a past that will never return, Shino looks deep into the forest where Nozomu ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah. Well then, let's see how my ungrateful disciple is doing. If he gets entangled with a strange demonic beast  on the  way, it will be troublesome later on. He's a very  troublesome pupil even when he's grown up. ...... " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letting out a powerless swear, Shino leaps from his spot. Leaping over the branches of the forest trees, he chases after Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A smile of self-mockery crosses his lips as he runs, oblivious to the presence of his disciples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shisho, the sun is about to set. You can't possibly add more ingredients to dinner now, okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been ordered by Shino to go for a run and explore the forest, did not fare well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no sign of small animals as well as edible nuts and grasses, and zero results. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he don't, he will probably go home empty handed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I don't bring something to the table, Shisho will definitely bend in bad mood." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having studied under Shino for nearly two years, Nozomu understood the character of his Master. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-46"></a>Nozomu's master, Shino, is a master of swordsmanship, and his skill in the art of swordsmanship is unsurpassed in all ages, but her personality is arrogant and irreverent even from the side, and he is  quite  an  eccentric  person.  This  is  evident  from  the  fact  that  even  before  the  construction  of Arcazam, she had settled alone in this forest, which was an undeveloped area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, she is childish, and once she bends in bad mood, she will have a hard time getting back into a good mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be nice if they could just complain about it, but if they are not careful, even a free and intense workout could be multiplied several times over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu could not bear to be subjected to such a situation. As he ran through the forest, Nozomu desperately kept his eyes on his surroundings. It is very dangerous to run in the forest when it is already getting dark. Roots of trees, rocks, and unevenness of the ground that cannot be seen could catch his feet and injure him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Nozomu's  steps  as  he  ran  through  the  forest  were  remarkably  quiet,  without  any stagnation at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the process of Shino training Nozomu, he was forced to run through these forest day and night, too many times to count. Naturally, he was attacked by a demonic beast once or twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he had become accustomed to  running over rough terrain  with  limited visibility and hiding from demonic beasts with superior senses to humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to Nozomu's wishes, he could not found food at all that would add a touch of splendor to his dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is a full-blown bad idea. ...... I not even find edible mushrooms, let alone meet. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was finally becoming impatient, but at that moment, from behind the trees, which were beginning to be enveloped in a dim darkness, came a noise that did not resemble the silence of the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happen?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wondering  what  was  going  on,  Nozomu,  killing  any  sign  of  his  presence,  padded  toward  the direction of the noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is that the neigh of a hexenbiest and is that a sound of magic bursting?" It's rare to see people come to a place like this. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What I was hearing as I got closer was, "Gooooooooooooo! The roar of the beast and the high-pitched sound of bursting bamboo were characteristic of the bursting sound of magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-47"></a>Magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A general term for power exercised by a magic-sourced force, called magical power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a technical system that is a counterpart to qi-jutsu and has been studied in many countries for a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pitch of the roar suggests thati will dealing with is a beast-type demonic beast. It is a powerful beast, even more powerful than a wild dog. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the possibility that he might be attacked in the future, Nozomu approaches the source of the noise to at least confirm the type of demonic beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cautiously hiding behind a nearby tree,  I quietly peeked into the back and involuntarily opened my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a bear-shaped demonic beast, a mad bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of them, snarling, stare at the human they have designated as their prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two bears must be brothers, as they are working together with a bear-type demonic beast that basically prefers to act alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike ordinary bears, mad bears are demonic beasts with blood-red fur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">B in the rank indicating the threat level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is such a demonic beast that an ordinary soldier has no chance against it even if they fights it alone, and it is normally fought by a party of four or five people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only two students facing such a demonic beast, to my surprise, the two students in the school and they were girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One is a girl with long black hair, holding a thin sword shining in silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other is a girl with a cane in each hand and moe yellow hair neatly trimmed at her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both were beautiful girls with extraordinary looks, but the reason Nozomu was surprised was that the two students fighting there were so famous in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gooooooooooo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Phew!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thin sword of the female student who was serving as the vanguard gleamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gwauuuuuuuu!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Sakuhaku no Kiki" (shockwave) overpowers the mad bear that is about to leap at it, and the flash that is swung accurately rips the mad bear's both eyes open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-48"></a>The Mad Bear is hit in the eye and bends over with a grunt. A tome thrust is fired into his empty chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gale-like stab pierced Mad Bear's chest, slid through the ribs, and destroyed the beast heart with precision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl in the vanguard, who easily slaughtered one of the large demonic beasts, is holding a thin mithril sword in her hand at the remaining one, her long, lustrous black hair reaching down to her waist blowing in the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The remaining mad bears were also roaring with anger at the defeat of their siblings, but at the same time, they looked frightened by the difference in strength between them and their opponents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina Francilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She belongs to the first class, the highest class in the second grade, and is the top female student in  her  grade  overall.  She  is  a  talented  young  lady  who  goes  by  the  nickname  "Black-Haired Princess". </p>
<p class="calibre1">" Oo Wind, wind back. Storm, roar. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Irisdina, the one who chanting magic is Tima Raim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is also one of the most notable figures in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is a girl with extremely powerful magical powers, a quality that is unmatched even by teachers, let alone students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of her outstanding talent, she was a rare person who was invited to Arcazam at an early age, even though she was originally a commoner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also had the second name of "The Spinner of Four Scales" and was one of the most famous students in the second grade, along with Irisdina Francilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With such a grand name, she chants with an enormous amount of magical power rising from her entire body, concentrating it at the tip of her staff to create a mighty swell of wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-huh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the sorm of the wind is unleashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spiraling wind beast swallows the second mad bear, instantly shredding its massive body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mad bear died before it had time to scream and was turned into pieces of dismembered flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gasps behind a tree at the sheer power of the magic attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Smashing that huge body with a single blow?" ....... How much magic did she put into that thing?" </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KGx0BD9/000006.jpg" alt="000006" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-50"></a>The brat of the wind tunnel. An attack magic that engulfs the wind and blasts the opponent with a vacuum vortex that cuts through the opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was an attack magic at the intermediate level, its power was clearly comparable to that of advanced magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power of magic depends on the scale and precision of the formulas that make up the magic, as well as the magical power that can be put into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though there was no sign of any modification to the technique she was chanting earlier, the fact  that  it  was  powerful  enough  to  reach  the  level  of  advanced  magic  was  proof  that  Tima's magical power was that powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It seems to be true that she has the greatest magic power of all time. ...... is not good!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Tima, who had unleashed a ridiculously powerful attack magic, let out a huge breath of relief, a huge shadow leapt out from behind a bush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A third mad bear popped out, different from the demonic beast they had just defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mad bears I mentioned earlier were not two, but three brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bear-shaped demonic beast, which had just appeared to flank the two, rushed in a straight line toward the relieved Tima. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crap!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively jumped out from behind the tree where he was hiding and ran to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, he activated his "flash step" and tried to somehow get between them and the demonic beast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  clearly  not  in  time.  Nozomu,  under  the  influence  of  ability  suppression,  did  not  have  the instantaneous power to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Phew!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Nozomu's  impatience  was  blown  away  by  the  five  magic  bullets  released  a  moment later. Without chanting or the deployment of a magic circle, the magic bullets formed instantly and accurately landed on the nose, both eyes, and both front legs of the charging Mad  Bear, greatly reducing the momentum of its charge. In the direction from which the magic bullet flew, there was a black-haired maiden holding up a thin sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediate deployment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-51"></a>It is an ability possessed by Irisdina Francilt, and is the ability to instantly activate magic, omitting the originally necessary chanting and magic circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprised by the magic bullets released without a pause, Nozomu pours his qi into the sword at his waist and unleashes it all at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pssst!" "Haaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu  -  Phantom  is  released,  and  an  extremely  compressed  qi  sword  passes  through  the  mad bear's body in an instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ga, Ga ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After making a choking moan, Mad bear's body was cut cleanly from the shoulder, and the two-part body spilled blood and rolled to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"……e?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Tima let out a gasp of surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It only took about half a second for Nozomu to release his phantom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was because the time it took was not so different from the time Iris Dina released the magic bullet with immediate deployment, but the power was not as if there was no comparison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, ha. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu was breathing roughly, his weariness coming from the consumption of his qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to its power, qijutsu - phantom does not consume much qi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  for  Nozomu  who  under  the  influence  of  ability  suppression,  even  the  slightest consumption of qi has a considerable effect on the physical body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that it was after a mock battle with Shino was also adding to the fatigue that was sweeping through his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry. You saved us, thank you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was trying to regulate his ragged breathing with his hands on his knees, a clear, beautiful voice, like rolling bells, drifted into his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looks up to see Iris Dina peering at him with eyes reminiscent of obsidian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gulps at the sight of his so well-dressed appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... um, are you okay, injured or anything?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm fine, she's fine, too. Thanks to your help." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-52"></a>When  Nozomu  asked  her  if  she  was  injured,  Irisdina  smiled  at  him,  her  dignified  expression breaking into a flower-like smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her smile is filled with a very calm atmosphere, despite the dignified aura she naturally exudes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once again, thank you for your help. My name is Irisdina Francilt. I am a second grade, first class student at Solminati Academy, just like you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also feels indescribably embarrassed by the words of gratitude, which he had not received from someone his own age in a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I-I’m Tima Lime. ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, on the other hand, introduced herself, but for some reason, she shrugged her shoulders as if wary of Nozomu and hid behind Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, she's my best friend, but she's shy. She is especially shy around men. No offense." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, I don't mind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he said he didn't mind, Nozomu felt his previously exuberant mood sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has been exposed to a variety of negative emotional stares at the school, but when he is so blatantly warned, his mood inevitably turns sour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And you are? From the looks of it, you are a student at Solminati Academy like us. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to change the subject, Irisdina asked Nozomu a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's heart beats loudly with a thump. His reputation and rumors at the school are so terrible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment she hears his name, she might get a palm strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is too rude not to say your name when the other person has said it first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More to the point, Irisdina Francilt is a member of a prestigious aristocratic family, with a father who  is  a  leading  figure  in  the  Kingdom  of  Forsina,  one  of  the  major  powers  involved  in  the construction of Arcazam, and a member of a large family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu swallowed his spit once and, as if determined, slowly opened his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Second grade, tenth class, Nozomu Bountis. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's reply was tense. Knowing his own notoriety that is spreading throughout the school, he braces himself for the next word of disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. This would be a tough place for a tenth-grade student to explore. Where is your party?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  hearing  Nozomu's  name  did  not  change  Irisdina's  attitude.  Instead  of  spewing  words  of contempt, she begins to scurry around, concerned for his well-being as a single person. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-53"></a>Nozomu, who was so taken aback by her appearance that he stiffened up with a blank expression on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to confirm this, Nozomu turns to Tima, who is behind Irisdina, and upon hearing Nozomu's name, her eyes widen and her wary gaze becomes more intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, she was aware of some not-so-good rumors about Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, tilts her head and stares at Nozomu, who is slow to react, with her hand on her slender chin, as if she really doesn't know about the rumors about Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a hint of doubt in his gaze, but still no alarming color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is a little surprised by Irisdina's reaction, but answers her question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not in a party. It's just me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you alone ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Tima were surprised to hear Nozomu say that he was alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Tima. They are two of the most talented people in terms of rank, A. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rank  is  a  graded  evaluation  of  the  individual  abilities  of  adventurers,  military  personnel,  etc., adopted by the countries of the Arkmill continent, and is raised or lowered by the defeat of demonic beasts,  the  accomplishment  of  requests  and  missions,  innovative  research  and  groundbreaking inventions, etc. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A rank is equivalent to a first-rate adventurer, a knight of the Kings guard, a court magician, or someone  who  is  so  involved  in  politics,  economics,  and  the  military  that  he  or  she  is  a  central figure in the government. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, only five students in the second grade were recognized by the school as equivalent to an A grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is normal for even such a highly skilled person to form a party if there is a possibility of coming face to face with a demonic beast, just in case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, well. No one wants to work with me because I have suppressed abilities. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a self-mocking smile, Nozomu spits it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt an unspeakable doldrums of emotion rising up from deep within my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ability Supression huh? The ability itself is only expressed by a small percentage of the school's students, but even among them it is extremely rare and can only be a fetter. And yet,  you have come this deep into the school all by yourself?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-54"></a>"Yes, I can train here without being afraid of anyone. I know I have little chance of getting stronger, but I still can't stop doing it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's piercing question also makes his words rough. Iris Dina's strong tone of reply made him fall silent as well. The air between them was heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. Sorry, that was a weird question." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I apologize for the rude tone of my response. So, Irisdina-san and her friends are at ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Irisdina is fine. Here, you and I are both just students at the academy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because… it’s okay, come on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps out of concern for Nozomu, Irisdina's attitude toward the commoner-born Nozomu was too easygoing, despite the fact that she was a genuine nobleman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, considering that the Solminati Academy itself was originally a place where the power of continental countries did not reach, Irisdina's point is not incorrect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand." ...... So, what are you doing here, Irisdina? It's very unusual for a student of the Solminati Academy to come here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I got a little research request from the Adventurer's Guild." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guild ... is this guy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu points to the mad bear he had just slain, Irisdina shakes her head in denial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no. There was a report of some strange beast seen in the forest recently. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"beast?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh right. they said, they saw a dragon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dragons ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this continent, dragons are legendary and the most powerful creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  kind  of  spirit  species,  it  boasts  immense  power  and  is  said  to  have  ruled  this  continent  in prehistoric times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is also said that whoever defeats this being will be granted immense power, but few people have seen it today, and both the dragon and the being that slayed it are only mentioned in textbooks and history books. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-55"></a>"not a chance in hell, It's a story that no one really cares about. Well, it could be a “Ryuu / Long” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(龍  /  Oriental  Dragon),  not  a  “dragon”  (竜/  western  dragon),          and  that's  why  we  need  to investigate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Dragons, Ryuu/Long are a type of demonic beast. Although its strength is far less than that of a real dragon and its intelligence is low, its huge stature and scorching breath pose an enormous threat to humans. It is definitely the highest-ranking existence in the category of demonic beasts, and a half-heartedly skilled person would have no chance at all against it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. ...... understand. I'll be careful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's good. Because if it were a dragon, we wouldn't be allowed to engage it either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiles carefree as she holds up her finger, "Beep." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her expression shows no hint of the negative feelings toward Nozomu's earlier attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by Irisdina's smile, Nozomu's tense expression relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  grateful  for  her  concern,  but  her  overly  easygoing  attitude  left  him  with  the impression that she might be a surprisingly mischievous person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, do you want to strip these guys down and take their material with you? One of the beast has been cut in half, so its value is diminished, but the meat and organs can be sold for a reasonable price." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a side note, Nozomu consults with her about how to handle the three mud bears they has just defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One of them is worthless because it has been pulverized by Tima's magic, but the other two are still useful as materials. " </p>
<p class="calibre1">Depending on the type of demonic beast, the skin can be used as material for clothing and armor, the meat for food, and the organs for alchemy and other uses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a valuable source of income for city-based adventurers and students who came to Al Khazam from distant lands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, thanks. All I received was a survey. You, my benefactor, can take it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"About the benefactor, ...... Tima?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, i don't need it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But neither Irisdina nor Tima seemed to have any particular need for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina is a daughter of a noble family, and Tima is also a special student invited by Arcazam. Neither of them is living a life where money is an issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-56"></a>"I understand. Well then, I can't take it all for myself, so I'll take some of the meat." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, for the time being, uses the knife at his waist to cut the meat and skin, and wraps the meat for tonight's dish in the skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then we're going back to the city. What about you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll be back in town in a moment.. I have class tomorrow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I understand. Thank you so much this time. You've been a big help." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, then, I'll take this one: ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bowing a small bow to Iris Dina, who thanked him again, Nozomu quickly left the place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina made sure that the departing nozomu disappeared into the depths of the forest, where it was beginning to get dark, and then she turned and called out to her best friend, who was hiding behind her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "Tima, I know you have a problem with men, but don't you have a different attitude to what you usually have?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Irisdina's rebuke, Tima looks away awkwardly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima is certainly not  good with men, and is so shy that she can't even speak as  far as standing alone in front of boys, but even so, her attitude toward Nozomu earlier was excessive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Ai. So, but it's that guy. they said he was messing with Lisa. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa  Hounds  is  a  female  student  in  the  second  grade,  first  class,  and  is  an  equal  to  Irisdina  in practical skills. Naturally, she is someone that Irisdina takes a keen interest in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I believe, I heard that Lisa was dating a boy she had known since childhood, but that he betrayed her. He was that person ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's words, which seemed to frighten her, Irisdina remembered the rumors she had heard in her first grade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She herself had never cared for it, but at the time the whole school year was talking about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally,  mindless  people  ridiculed  them  as  a  disproportionate  couple,  and  I  remember  the rumors spreading quickly, along with Nozomu's bad reputation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-57"></a>"Hm. But he didn't seem like the kind of person who would do such a terrible thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not having seen the scene firsthand, the rumors about Nozomu are not corroborative for Irisdina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  after  meeting  Nozomu  himself,  she  noticed  a  clear  disconnect  between  Nozomu's reputation at the school and his own temperament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Irisdina, who has lived in an aristocratic society where mending facial expressions is natural, the psychology of Nozomu, whose interpersonal skills have been decimated, is easy to understand, and his temperament is not hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above  all,  from  Irisdina's  point  of  view,  his  sword  flash  was  awesome  and  at  the  same  time straightforward and clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a fellow swordsman, I couldn't help but admire it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  intuition  as  an  aristocrat  and  as  a  swordsman  whispered  to  her  that  Nozomu's  nature  was different from the rumors spreading in the school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, yeah. But I was scared. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima drops her shoulders and shrinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She herself is a very gentle person, but she is not very good with men and is a bit fragile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima herself had heard the rumors and was aware that she had overreacted to Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, next time you see him, you can apologize then. You shouldn't worry too much about it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah. ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina consoles her depressed best friend as they make their way back to the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she glanced behind her, Nozomu was already out of sight in the shadows of the trees. </p>

<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu, who got an unexpected side dish of mad bear meat, returned to his Shino hut in high spirits. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, ......, you're very late. Did you find a beautiful doe?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, that? Why are you in bad mood, Shisho?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-58"></a>He was staring at Shino, who had been watching the whole thing with Irisdina and the others, and was breaking out in a cold sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Shino's mood did not return that night, and Nozomu had to double his training the next morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">Administrative district in the northern part of Arcazam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's home was located in the place where the important people who run this city reside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Francilt Mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mansion, built of white marble, is a compound for Irisdina and her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In her room in the mansion, Irisdina was lying on her back on the bed in her uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the side, it was a very sensational sight to see her slender body thrown out and her shiny legs stretched out from her skirt, teasing the silk sheet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the head maid, who was her chaperone, found out, she would surely be scolded for being too modest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now Irisdina had forgotten even to change her clothes and take a hot bath, and was thinking about the strange encounter that took place today in the spasim forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu Bountis ...... he..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">What comes back to my mind is the image of a male student who cut down a demonic beast that attacked his best friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it a sword that cuts the body of a mad bear? That attack. How long would it take if I tried to do it ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iris Dina suddenly pulls out a thin sword still at her waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword is inscribed with the silver wings of the Evening Star. The mithril-made sword, a gift from her father and swordmaster when she came to Arcazam, shines bewitchingly in the moonlight streaming in through the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mithril  is  a metal  with  a high affinity  for magic  and has the property of  accumulating magical power inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-59"></a>As a material for armor, it stands head and shoulders above other materials and is an ideal metal that combines hardness and flexibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, veins of mithril are rare throughout the continent, and its price has always been close to that of gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using such mithril, and made with Irisdina's habits in mind, the thin sword is undoubtedly a first-class piece of armory, and can be called a partner for her as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she returned the thin mithril sword in her hand to its sheath and released it onto the bed, then stood up abruptly and stepped to one of the walls of her room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There, propped up against it, is a thin sword for children, rather small for her current use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking the sword in her hand, the handle of which was dirty, Irisdina poured her magic into the sword and began to cast her enhanced magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In her head, she casts a lot of magic, thinking of the extreme swords she witnessed today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is over and over again and again and again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, the sword sword transforms into a sword that embraces blackness reminiscent of the dark night and silver light reminiscent of moonlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic sword, lunar eclipse night.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a magic sword that boasted especially high power among Irisdina's magic, and was capable of cutting down even the mad bear she encountered today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since both the qi and the magical power are based on the power of the soul called the source, there is not much difference in the effects that are manifested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The difference is that the accuracy of the technique to be expressed depends on the sense of the surgeon, and the magic depends on the mental state and technique of the surgeon.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, even if the power is based on the same source, it tends to repel each other when it takes the form of qi or magical power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  magic  sword  created  by  Irisdina,  combined  with  the  sword's  materials  and  her  own background, can probably cut through even the solid scales of Ryuu/Long species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in front of the magic sword she had created herself, she only smiled dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten seconds of time. "Ten seconds, Hmm, it's far from him" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten seconds. That is an extraordinary amount of time to create a magical sword, but now that she knew the fact that there was someone who could create a sword equivalent to this in half a second, and now she only has a bitter smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-60"></a>Come to think of it, he wasn't headed in the direction of the city. ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina recalls the time she left Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He walked in the opposite direction of Irisdina and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Night is the time of the beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Few people would attempt to remain alone in a forest where powerful  demonic beasts begin to operate in earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If there are any, they are either fools who simply do not understand the dangers of the forest, or scouts and covert operatives who know the movements of the beasts of the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu Bountis ... what kind of person he is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he do not hesitate at all to remain in the forest at night, where demonic beasts abound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the qi-jutsu, which can cut down even powerful demonic beasts with a single stroke, and the swordsmanship that supports it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's discomfort with her strange classmates was slowly beginning to swell, transforming into interest. </p>
