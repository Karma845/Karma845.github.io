<h3>Epilogue &#8211; The Smoldering Ember, Something That Still Tied Up</h3>

<p class="calibre1">He saw a dream. A dream in which both the sky and the ground were dyed in bright red. However, Nozomu could not believe that it was a dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place was probably Solminati Academy. However, the school building reminiscent of a chalk castle has collapsed, and the surrounding area has become a burnt field with scattered gravel </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh....." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things that used to be part of human body are scattered around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was already carbonized to the point where it was hard to tell who it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smell of roasting meat caught his nose, and he couldn't resist vomiting out the contents of his stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A clear sensation, which did not seem to be a dream, told Nozomu clearly that this was something that could happen in reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this hell, there was a dragon. It had a jet-black body with five-color and six-wings. There was no mistaking it for the giant dragon that was supposed to be inside Nozomu body. It was Tiamat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His mouth is moving as if he is chewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa haa haa haa haa............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had a bad feeling about the scene. His breath became ragged and his heart beat fast. His Instinct told him, "Don't look!" but by the time he thought that, it was too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, ah......aaaaaaaaaah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was sticking out from it mouth was her red long hair. When the owner of that hair flashed through his head, he screamed and lunged at that giant dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, a huge jet-black flame burst into flames. His consciousness was engulfed by the flames of chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bedclothes are thrown off and fall to the floor with a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The futon that had been hung is bounced off and falls to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huuahhh! Ha...ha...ha …………" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu checked his body in a hurry, exhaling a rough breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-280"></a> he couldn't help but confirm that he was alive in such a realistic scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......dream?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body is bandaged here and there, and there are traces of medical treatment, but the body is perfectly intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had a breath of relief, back to bed as it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I see, after that battle, I lose consciousness. ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of the soft bed as he sank into it finally reminded Nozomu of what had happened after the battle with Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Irisdina and Somia walked over to him, he was so happy and relieved that he lost his strength and his eyes went completely dark. Perhaps he fainted at that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How long has passed..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu finally remembered his situation and looked around again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room in which he was laid out was reminiscent of a guest room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room, which appeared to be a room in the Francilt mansion, was white without a single stain, and there was a fireplace in one corner of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room is furnished with a chest of drawers, a desk, a chair, and other furnishings, all of which are simple, yet strangely elegant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside  the  window,  a  large  garden  could  be  seen,  where  gardeners  and  maids  were  removing broken furniture and dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps things that broke in the battle with Rugato. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For now, I guess that means Rugato-san has retreated...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">While watching the maids cleaning up, he remember the last line of Rugato he heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu was looking out, there was a knock on the door of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the door opens, two black-haired girls enter the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad. You're awake......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san, are you alright?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Somia enter the room and see Nozomu regaining consciousness, she smiled with a flowery smile on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu nods to the approaching girls after realizing they were okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How long have I fainted?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Roughly half a day. But thank God. I was worried because you suddenly fainted" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-281"></a>Nozomu  fainted  because  of  the  release  of  his  ability  suppression,  but  before  that,  he  was  also affected by his intense exhaustion due using Annihilation Light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rapid drain of qi has a serious impact on life support activities To be honest, he lucky enough that if he didn't die like Shino. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What about ...... Rugato-san?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu asks for the end story after that </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Irisdina, Rugato was unable to retrieve Somia's soul because of the destruction of the contract, as Nozomu had said just before he fainted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, he returned to the Dizard Empire to report this matter to the Lord he served. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems, that the half of the body, which was cut off by Nozomu, had healed cleanly after a few hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugato himself says that it is because he was cut so beautifully that he was able to heal so quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima and Mars-kun are at the school right now, but they will be here after school. Ena-san is back home safely. Why the Francilt family made a secret agreement with the Waziart family. I've heard from Rugato-shi, so i'd like to talk about this too. Is that okay? " </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh well, that......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Nozomu's stomach rumbled. He had been drained of energy, and his body seemed to be craving for nourishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu scratched his cheeks in embarrassment, while Irisdina and Somia smile and chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It looks you're okay. I'll bring you a meal, so please wait a moment. Somia, let's go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, ane-sama! Then Nozomu-san, please wait for your meal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sisters say so and leave the room amicably. After seeing them off, Nozom sits down on the bed and thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nightmare he had earlier passes through Nozomu's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not knowing how to explain the secret he had, Nozomu puts aside the uneasiness that remains like a lump in his throat and looks forward to the meal that will satisfy his hunger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">† </p>
<p class="calibre1">That evening. It was not twilight  yet, but the sun was slowly beginning to set when the parties involved in yesterday's incident gathered in a room at the Francilt house. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-282"></a>First  of  all,  Irisdina  explained  the  secret  agreement  between  the  Francilt  and  Waziart  families, which was the beginning of the incident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The secret agreement three hundred years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time, the Forsina Kingdom was in the midst of a civil war over the succession to the throne, and the country was in turmoil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conflict was between a faction directly affiliated with the king and a faction of the royal family that had obtained the cooperation of foreign powers, and at that time, the Francilt family belonged to the faction directly affiliated with the king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the factions with which the Francilt family cooperated gradually became inferior, and eventually they could not help themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At such a time, the then head of the Francilt family relied on the Waziart family of the Dizzard Empire,  which  was  a  neighboring  country  but  had  no  diplomatic  relations,  as  a  means  of overturning their inferiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using the power of their unusual abilities and magical tools behind the scenes, the king's faction, the Francilt family, eliminated the hostile forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The furnace of spiritual flame fused to Somia's body was one of the items originally used in the civil war at that time, and was a vampire-race magical tool that used the souls of others as sacrifices to share its mighty power and life force with the user. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Francilt family, which had earned the royal family's trust through its exploits, became absolute in its power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In return for their cooperation, the Francilt paid the Waziart a huge sum of money and agreed to lease the magical tools for 300 years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, Rugato was in the service of the then head of the House of Waziart 300 years before the  contract  was  made,  and  was  apparently  present  when  the  secret  agreement  was  concluded between the two heads of families. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the old gentleman who knew about that time, the head of the Francilt family, who made the secret agreement, took the lease time of 300 years because they was concerned about the resurgence of hostile forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Waziart family is also a long-lived vampire, it seems that they didn't really care about leaving a period of 300 years due to the difference in their sense of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-283"></a>"Although  that  is  a  crisis  of  the  royal  family,  my  ancestors  may  have  been  desperate  for  the situation that was in dire straits" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What about the furnace of spiritual flame that fused with Somia-chan's soul ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah.  It seems,  The current head of the Waziart family is also  unable to separate the furnace of spiritual flame from Somia's soul" </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Irisdina, the furnace of spiritual flame was used on Somia a long time ago, which seems to be right after she was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"if so, could it be..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Nozom  heard  the  story,  he  remembered  their  mother,  who  had  died  after  giving  birth  to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps it was my mother who used the furnace of spiritual flame on Somia. Somia was a pretty premature baby right after she was born......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a complicated expression on her face, she gently patted Somia's head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's usual cheerful expression was also gone, and tears were floating around her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia-chan..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay. I think my mother did all this because she wanted me to live." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia raises her face with tears filling her clenched eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face, while still dark, held a strong light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I immediately contacted the main Francilt family about this matter, As that old butler had said, the rest will come down to some kind of compromise between the main Francilt family and the Waziart family" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"... Irisdina-san, was it okay to tell us this story?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This story should not be publicized by the Francilt family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina replies, as she doesn't care about Nozomu's doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't mind. Even though we got caught up in our own situation this time, you guys helped us. I don't want to hide anything from the people who saved our lives. I won't let these guys at home get their hands on you all even if they find out about this" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, with her arms crossed, assures them that she doesn't mind at all. There is no hesitation in her expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let me thank you again. I want to thank you again for saving my life this time. It's because of you guys that we didn't lose Somia. I really ..... appreciate it...... thank you" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-284"></a>"Really ... Thank you very much for your help!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Francilt sisters bow down in unison thanked Nozomu and the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, no. It's something not you to worry about......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's not true! You were so cool when you saved me from the Grim Reaper!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, that's exactly what Somia says" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I don't want to be so complimented. Beside I am ..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  was  concerned  that  he  had  been  lost  in  that  battle  until  the  very  end.  His  expression naturally hardened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, can you hear me? What the hell did you do at the end of that battle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who had been watching the situation of Nozomu, asked with a serious look on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and others were silent to Mars's words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  because  the  girls  were  privately  concerned  about  Nozomu's  unusual  power  that  he  had shown in the previous battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All eyes in the room were on Nozomu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew you were a lot stronger than the guys at the academy said you were. but you were really insane at that time" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence reigns as Nozomu slowly opens his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was ............ the release of ability suppression......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The release of ability suppression?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia tilts her head, but Nozomu continues his explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm severely limited by my own abilities, which severely limit my qi energy, physical abilities, and  magical  power,  but  at  the  end  of  my  sophomore  year,  I  was  able  to  break  free  from  this abilities" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was wondering if it might be. The reason you was absent from the school and terribly injured at that time was ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yeah. I had a lot going on at the time, and I was able to release my ability suppression" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why didn't you ever use it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"that is…………" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today's dream scene flashes back. The smell of the burnt-out Alkazam and the people of the burnt-out city. The resurrected Tiamat. Then, a scene where is her being eaten by that giant dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“………… Nozomu-kun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-285"></a>”Ah, no, I'm sorry. I was little daze. I could release my ability supression, but I can't control the power at all. My qi is always at full power, and it's impossible for me to control it, so I didn't use it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu replied, trying to mend the anxiety inside him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu words don't tell the whole story. Neither that word nor everything, including Tiamat, was spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because even a big rocks are shattered just by hitting it, It's not something you can use on your opponent” </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure, it's not easy to use.…......, Moreover, all your your techniques are like that” </p>
<p class="calibre1">"... I'm aware of it" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, even after this, Nozomu could not tell about him being a dragon slayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, as time passed and the twilight dyed the sky, Nozomu and his friends decided to go home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Somia followed Nozomu and the others to the gate of the mansion to see them off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then we're going home" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"See you" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"See you again at the school..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, see you again" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu finishes said his farewell and was about to return to the dormitory for the first time in two days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Somia, who was by Irisdina's side, held Nozomu's hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong? Somia-chan" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank  you  for  saving  me,  Nozomu-san!  At  that  time,  I  thought  I  would  never  see  Ane-sama anymore, but ...... I'm so happy to be with her again!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia thanked Nozomu again, who panicked, wondering what was going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina also held the other hand and thanked him once again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If, if you hadn't helped me then, they definitely would have taken Somia. I ...... surely would not have been able to bear it. Thank you ...... so much" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's heart lightened a little at the words of gratitude presented once again by the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-286"></a>There were many things he could not talk about, and there was a great deal of anxiety in his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was still a small lump remains deep in his chest, but at least he feels that releasing his ability suppression at that time was not a mistake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Oh, by the way, i haven't given this to Somia-chan yet?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia nodded her head at Nozomu's words. Nozomu took it out of his pocket and presented it to Somia with the day-late words, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know I'm a little late, but happy birthday" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took out a birthday present that he had intended to give to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is made by tying an indigo-colored string into a loop, attaching a cord to the loop, and attaching a bell used in the East to the end of the loop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was made in honor of an arm ornament that she treasured as a bond between family members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I used your arm ornament as a reference, and to be honest, it was my first time to make a bell, so I can't say that it's a flattering gift..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm very happy! Thank you Nozomu-san!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An unfashinable and ugly-looking arm ornament were certainly not appropriate for a person with high status and good capacity like somia's to wear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that did not matter to Somia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind  the  awkward  shape  of  the  bell,  she  sensed  Nozomu's  feelings,  who  had  made  many attempts on her behalf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She put Nozomu's arm ornament on her vacant right wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When shook it, the bell was still making a chilling sound, but Somia's face broke out in joy and she was excited to ring the bell over and over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, too, watched her sister with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was in tears of joy, and Mars was looking away, but his mouth was relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tumultuous day. A smile that they thought it seemed they would never see again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene they wanted to protect was indeed there. </p>
