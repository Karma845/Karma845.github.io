<h3>Chapter 4: Those Who Once Have Fled, Those Who Still Struggle</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Why don't you make use of the Adventurers' Guild?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  Irisdina's  suggestion,  Nozomu  visited  the  Adventurers'  Guild  again.  The  purpose was, of course, to accept the request, but there was a slight problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist refused to accept Nozomu's request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. Not allowed."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have told you many times that your current rank is D, and that you are allowed to search alone in the Spasim Forest only from rank C. We do not permit requests in the forest without a party"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was planning to accept a collection in the suburbs of Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the Adventurers' Guild does not permit individuals below C rank to accept requests in the forest alone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, they are always required to form a party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On this day, Irisdina and Tima are on personal business, while Mars is caught by Hanna and forced to help in the store.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, the guild does not allow low-ranked persons to parasite on high-ranked persons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the deduction of evaluation points due to rank differences within a party, Nozomu needed to be paired with someone close to his own rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unfortunately, Nozomu did not know of any students of rank C or lower who could form a party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, as a point of fact, I don't have any idea who might be willing to work with me. Besides, I've been in the spasim forest alone many times. So ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So you want me to allow you to take requests alone? That's impossible. And if you can't find a partner, that's your problem. According to your file, you are in the third grade. If you've been in town for more than two years and you're not trusted, isn't that your problem?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The capability to  create trust  is  also  a great  strength.  It  is  your responsibility to  create and develop relationships with others. Time is not infinite"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu can only be silent in the face of such a sound argument.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Nozomu hardly ever shows his face while he is being trained by Shino.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only requests he received were a few times during his training, when he was alone to do chores such as ditching and carrying luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of his self-evasion, he avoided meeting people, especially people his own age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Besides, what's the reason you're now starting to ask me to take requests in the forest?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-97"></a>"It's ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can't say what I want to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself does not know what he wants to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He feels that there is no reason for him to become stronger or to stay at the school. Because the woman he wanted to protect has long since left his side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist let out a sigh as Nozomu fell silent and began to put away the request form in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If there's nothing else, we're done. Please leave. There are other students waiting in line"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please wait ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's trembling voice, as if he was trying to squeeze it out, leaked out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  receptionist,  who  was  putting  away  the  request  form,  stopped  at  the  tone  of  his  voice, which sounded weak and impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can't say it well. I just feel like I have to do something"</p>
<p class="calibre1">An irritation swirling in the back of his chest. What it is, Nozomu still does not know. In truth, perhaps it is the fact that he does not know that he does not know what it is that is making him so impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  Nozomu  understood  that  it  was  definitely  born  from  the  realization  of  his  own escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he must move, even if only a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Please. I don't care what it takes. Can you give me one more chance?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As  I said  before ......, we cannot  grant  requests to enter the forest.  However, there are still vacancies for patrols around the city perimeter. Would that be okay for you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  patrols  around  the  outer  wall  were  originally  low  in  terms  of  difficulty,  and  they  only received a reasonable amount of evaluation points. However, for Nozomu, just the fact that the request was accepted was a significant development.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, please!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good. Then here it is. The patrol route will be around Arcazam, and you will go around with the guards at the south gate. Is that clear?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she watches Nozomu run off with the request form, the receptionist lets out a small sigh and reaches for the remaining documents in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is not saying what she is saying because she wants to say it. She is saying what she has to say because she is in a position to say it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And considering their guild's position, it is only natural that they have no trust in Nozomu, who has suddenly returned to their guild after not having been seen by them for some time. In fact, they felt antagonistic toward his sudden attempt to gain recognition.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-98"></a>Still, she introduced the request because it is her job and she has more experience in society than he does.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Although, I wonder how long he can keep it up. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As is often the case in society, the lower you fall, the harder it is to get back up. She had seen many students struggle to regain their grades and reputation, only to give up in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this in mind, the receptionist had just finished putting away some papers when she sensed someone approaching the counter she was working.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She put the documents she had on hand aside again and greeted the visitor with the smile she had cultivated over the years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome to the Adventurers Guild. May I help you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I would like to make a request for nomination"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A mature maid visited the counter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She has a straight back and a wrinkle-free maid's uniform. Her eyes are as sharp as swords, and her quiet demeanor suggests that she is a maid with a touch of elegance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, which one and how would you like to make your request?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist, who senses that the client is an escort maid for a very high-ranking aristocrat, swallows her spit from nervousness, but responds without breaking into a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The request for a nomination is also proof of the client's admiration for the student. A person who is nominated by a squire of a high-ranking aristocrat is sure to be a promising student.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The nominee is Nozomu Bountis, third grade, tenth class. The request is to escort the second daughter of the Francilt family"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist, who had been thinking about this and preparing herself to listen to the details of the request, was taken aback by the next words of the maid in question, Mena Manat, and let out an unintentional gasp of dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a face that was as clueless as a seasoned veteran's, she remained in a daze until the maid who had been the main culprit spoke to her a few seconds later.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who was handed a request for a patrol, left the guild and headed for the south gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When he arrived at the south gate, he visited the guard station and showed his request form to two guards in steel armor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One was a mature man with a scruffy beard and mustache. The other was a young man of about 20 years old.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, well. I'm Barozza, and this is Jibin, also from the Guard"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to meet you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm Nozomu Bountis. Nice to meet you"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-99"></a>"You've probably heard, but this time we'll be patrolling the city perimeter. After leaving the south gate, we will patrol eastbound to the north gate. Normally we patrol in groups of three, but due to a sudden illness, I was unable to do so. I've asked them to come instead"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a quick greeting, the three of them leave the post and head for the south gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once outside the gate, they went counterclockwise around the outer wall to see if there were any traces of demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  trees  around  the  outer  wall  of  Arcazam  had  been  cut  down  in  preparation  for  the approach of the outside enemy, so the visibility was quite good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The streets are also well maintained, making it much easier to walk than walking around in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this does not mean that we can relax.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you go 20 meters away, you will find yourself in the forest of Spasim, which is overrun with demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A metre is the unit of length used on the Arkmill continent, and is roughly the length of an adult's outstretched hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And a distance of 20 metres is enough for a demonic beast to attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there are not that many magical beasts that approach Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, since there was a possibility that they could be attacked at any time, they had to be on their guard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The three passed the east gate along the outer wall and headed for the north gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them walked along the outer wall, passing through the east gate and heading for the north gate. It is unusual for third graders to be given the job of patrolling. When you're as old as you are, you'd be actively going into the forest with your schoolmates,.......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a state where I can't help you......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, did you get into a fight? Or is it a love affair?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're being inappropriate, senpai"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jibin complains to Barozza, who asks a probing question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is it? For you, too, it's about the school you admired and used to go to, isn't it? Don't you want to hear about it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It wasn't love that I longed for"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, Jibin is a former student of Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a guard now, but I used to be in the Soluminati Academy, I was expelled after one year because I didn't get enough grades"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was speechless at the mention of being expelled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, you know, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, don't worry about it. It was a long time ago, and when they decided to expel me, I didn't feel bitter about it. It's still a good memory"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-100"></a>Nozomu was surprised to see Jibin smiling so carefree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  would  be  understandable  if  he  had  gradually  accepted  the  situation  over  a  long  period  of time, but how could he say that he had no regrets from the time he left school?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What made you think it was a good memory?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because I gave it my all. I was shattered, but it was a big moment to have worked so hard in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I did it with all my might, so I have no regrets. Nozomu understands this feeling well. Because he has experienced the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last training with Shino, in which they both gave it all, and both put their hearts and souls into it. And those last words have become a major pillar of support for Nozomu today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A"h, that's for sure, I think I understand ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right? It's because I was in that academy that I was able to become a member of the guard of this city like this. Do you know? Guards in this city are pretty well paid, you know?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jibin smiles at Nozomu's sympathetic words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is not a shadow of a smile on his face, and he sincerely feels that the challenges of his youth were good ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jibin does not mind at all that he was expelled from school, but rather uses it as food for life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Comparing him to himself, who remains at a standstill, Nozomu envies him a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Nozomu's senses felt a strange sensation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pressure was subtle, as if the tip of a needle had been pressed against his skin, and it was coming from all parts of his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong, boy?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barozza called out to Nozomu, who suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jibin, next to him, was also standing there with a curious look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's something here, sir"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean by something?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know what it is ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two guards did not seem to notice, but Nozomu was acutely aware of the observant glances that came out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes in their gazes was tinged with a hint of hostility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His whole body was awash in millet, and his heart was beating fast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's about a hundred and fifty metres from here, further into the bush"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How do you know ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some of these beasts are very good at detecting things. I wouldn't be surprised if they were watching us from deep in the bushes"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-101"></a>"No, not that way ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is difficult to see into the dark from the light. Moreover, if one deviates from the perimeter pathway, one is immediately confronted with a sea of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was no ordinary sensation to detect a demon beast in the depths of such thick bush, more than a hundred meters away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wary of the gaze he felt, Nozomu sat back and let his mind wander over his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With his right hand on the hilt of his sword, he relaxed his muscles so that he would be able to pull it out as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barozza and Jibin, who were standing next to Nozomu, looked at him with wide eyes, gulped, and shivered as he suddenly changed the atmosphere surrounding them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feel of a gaze that was drowned out in an instant. After a few seconds, Nozomu exhaled heavily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... has disappeared. It seems that thing ran away when it noticed us"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming that the other party had retreated, Nozomu released his posture and began to move toward the bushes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When  they  had  entered  the  forest  about  150  meters  from  the  outer  wall,  they  found  the footprints of several demon beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of demon beast is this...?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"From the footprints, it looks like a lot of them are direwolves ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  was  there  were  the  footprints  of  direwolves.  Moreover,  some  of  the  footprints  were familiar to Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The footprints, which were larger than those of a normal direwolf, were the same as those found yesterday when he was searching with Irisdina and others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you know?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yesterday, when I encountered a herd of direwolves on the main road, there were five magical beast. One of them escaped, but ...... this one"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  what  caught  Nozomu's  eye  even  more  was  the  footprints,  which  were  even  larger  than those of the earlier magical beast direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Footprints reminiscent of a large demon beast like a mad bear. Considering the depth of the sunken ground, it must have weighed more than twice as much as the escaped magical stone bearer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's huge. I've never seen footprints this big"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not direwolf ....... Perhaps it's a Garm ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh, really? It's an A-ranked magical beast!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is also known as the 'Hell's Demon Wolf'. Unlike the direwolf, it is a very dangerous beast, having reddish-blonde hair like a collar, and possessing magic skills from birth.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-102"></a>"Maybe this is the beast that leading the herd of direwolves"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In some direwolf herd, which have high social skills, there are cases where different species of the same family can be mixed in with the pack. We could guess that this was one of those.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rank A, ordinary soldiers and students would be no match for this kind. The top rankers of the academy would no doubt form a party to take it down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what was more threatening than anything else was the fact that such a dangerous magical beast had come so close to the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Barozza-san, let's get back soon"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yeah, that's right"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Barozza was stunned by the might of the beast that might have attacked him, but Nozomu's voice  finally  brought  him  back  to  her  senses,  and  he  hurriedly  started  back  the  way  he  had come.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The report of the three men was immediately sent to the relevant authorities, and the next day, a request was sent to the influential people of the school as a specially designated request for the defeat of the beast.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After leaving the guild after the report of the magical beast, Nozomu went to the library on his way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose was to look for Grisden Harlantide's book on spirits, which he had found the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  sun  had  already  begun  to  tilt  to  the  west  when  Nozomu  made  his  way  to  the library due to a request he had received at the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking through the library, which was beginning to turn vermilion, he ran his eyes over the bookshelves, looking for the desired item.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the key book was not there. He was about to move on, wondering if it was on another shelf, when Nozomu was approached by a voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Huh? Nozomu-kun, have you been in the library again?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Tom Dale who called out to him. He had a small armful of books piled high.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, uhm. I'm just doing some research"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you looking for?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I'm looking for a book by Grisden Harlantide ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grisden? Yeah, I know who he is, but that's unusual. What are you looking for?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, who had placed the book he was carrying on the desk close at hand, asked Nozomu again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's about spirits. ....... What do you mean by unusual?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, Grisden Harantide was an alchemist and a researcher who studied spirits, but apparently he was a rather peculiar man. His books are quite famous ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-103"></a>Grisden Harlantide was apparently an alchemist and researcher, just like Tom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right,  if  you're  curious,  I  know  someone  who  knows  a  lot  about  Grisden's  research.  I  can introduce you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really? But are you sure?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, sure. The other day, you helped Shina when she got tangled up with Calanti, didn't you?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Follow me for a minute"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom encouraged Nozomu to follow him as he picked up the book he had left on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As he recommended, Nozomu followed him, and he stammered out of the library and began to follow the pathway in the back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Nozomu, who has lived in Arcazam for a little over two years, had never seen this path before. As Nozomu looked at Tom with a doubtful expression on his face, Tom, sensing his puzzled look, turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is a passageway that connects the library and the Groaurum Institute. Whenever I need to borrow materials from the library for research or other purposes, I always use this path"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, ...... It's the Gloaurum Institution? It's a research institute, but am i allowed to go there?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The institute is divided into a number of blocks according to the level of secrecy, and the lowest level is safe to visit. Besides, the results of research conducted at the Groaurum Institution are disclosed regardless of the country.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, we arrived at our destination.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounded  by  a  five-meter  wall,  it  was  a  white  building.  It  is  the  research  facility  of  the Groaurum Institute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The site area is almost equivalent to that of the Solminati Academy. It is a scale rarely seen on the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grouarum Institute is a highly public research institution.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its  achievements  are  also  impressive,  systematizing  magic  and  qi  techniques  that  had  been scattered throughout the continent, and contributing greatly to the technological development of the entire continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no back entrance to the research facility. We walked around to the front gate along the outer wall and were taken to the reception desk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Tom had a brief exchange with the receptionist, Nozomu was handed a list of outside visitors from the receptionist, a list used to keep track of those entering and leaving the facility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, no one can enter the facility without filling in their name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu  entered his  name on the list,  he was  given a plate indicating that he was an outside visitor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The plate has a string attached to it so that it can be worn around the neck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked at the back of the plate and saw two magic circles engraved on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A noise magic circle of identification. is this mithril?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-104"></a>"It's a mithril alarm system that easily channels and stores magic power. It's part of it. You have to wear it properly. If you take it off, it will set off the alarm"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding in agreement with Tom's advice, Nozomu followed him into the Gloaurum Institution facility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A stark white stone corridor, devoid of any superfluous ornamentation, is flanked on both sides by massive black-painted doors. It seemed to be a place where the latest magical research was being conducted, and in a different direction than the facilities at the Solminati Academy, it had a more sophisticated atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, Nozomu did not go around the vast research facility and arrived at his destination early.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where are we?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">We were led to a wooden door, a little different from modern research facilities. A plaque on the door reads "Torgrain Laboratory".</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The laboratory of my mentor, Torgrain Harlantide"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Harlandtide"</p>
<p class="calibre1">That's what I mean. Sorry, Nozomu. I've got my hands full. Can you open the door?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, uhn, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Nozomu put his hand on the doorknob, a faint voice came from behind the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still no good?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, the spirit did not answer my call ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A familiar, cool voice. However, the tone of the voice is somewhat tinged with discouragement and disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This voice ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's hand stops as he reaches for the doorknob. Spirit, calling out, not answering. The words suggested that the person behind the door was the elf girl he knew.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Shina, can't you even sense it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Un ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">From behind the door, he hears not only Shina's voice, but also Mimuru's.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, no, it's nothing"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom  did  not  hear  the  girls'  voices  leaking  out,  but  he  tilted  his  head  behind  Nozomu  and implicitly urged him to open the door as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu decides to open the door. With a clang, all eyes in the room turned to Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's gaze turns to surprise when she sees Nozomu's figure, and then to disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-105"></a>Why does she hate me so much? The question that has been nagging at me since I first met her begins to grow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While she has certainly been the target of abusive remarks from some of the more mindless students, the majority of them look at Nozomu with indifference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the mockers, like the students in the tenth grade, were just trying to feel superior, and only a few students, such as Lisa or Camilla, would look at her with such obvious dislike.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, then, has not been acquainted with Shina until recently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sensei, i've brought the materials you asked for! Ah, Shina was here too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Nozomu  and  Shina  are  facing  each  other,  Tom  comes  into  the  laboratory  with  the materials.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, just leave it there. Anyway, Tom-kun, who's that over there?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's voice was answered by a man in his mid-thirties wearing a white coat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was tall, but his body was thin. He was holding a pipe in his mouth, puffing smoke and holding the rising smoke up to the light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looks to be in her thirties or so, but he is more well-rounded than one would expect, and is so young that he looks like he is in his late twenties to some people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is an acquaintance of mine. He has some questions, he wants to ask you about your great-grandfather"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, my name is Nozom Bountis"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am Torgrain Harlantide. I study alchemy here. Oh, sorry for the smoke. I was just burning some reagents to see how the spirits react"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  man  in  the  white  coat  extinguishes  the  incense  and  begins  to  put  away  his  pipe.  His clattering hands are somewhat dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When you say 'Great-Grandfather,' do you mean Grandfather Grisden?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am. I heard that he had studied about spirits, and I was looking for his books ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that he did was to clap his hands and put away his tools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As for the books written by my great-grandfather, there are several, but to be honest, very few of them are left"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, what is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it was a long time ago. I don't think there are any books of my great-grandfather's left, except for the ones in the library"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's shoulders slumped in disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry I couldn't help you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, thank you very much. By the way, what were you doing earlier?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, this smoke is from dried and burned grass called spirit grass. This grass is liked by spirits, or reacts with the source element in the air, that is, it reacts with the movement of the spirits</p>
<p class="calibre1">....."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-106"></a>At that moment, Torgrain's gaze turned to Shina, who was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, if you want to talk about spirits, she can ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Torgrain-sensei, I just remembered something I need to do, may I be excused for the rest of the day?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Torgrain can finish his sentence, Shina breaks off the conversation. Her voice was still tinged with a strong tone of rejection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Torgrain, who had been cut off, looked at Nozomu with a somewhat helpless expression on his face and said he was sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Shina, I can't help you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, thank you, sensei. I'll see you later ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina bowed her head and left the laboratory without once looking back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An awkward atmosphere drifted through Torgrain's laboratory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheena bowed to me and walked out of the lab without looking back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have a problem with her?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"N~no. I have no idea myself ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Nozomu had no idea what was going on, so it was no wonder he was so unaware of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, what you said about Shina-san not being able to use spirit magic is ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  true.  She  has  lost  the  power  that  makes  an  elf  can  be  called  a  fairy  race,  the  power  to communicate with spirits."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Torgrain's  words  of  affirmation  brought  an  indescribable  expression  to  Nozomu's  face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, too, was a person whose potential had been closed off in a way that she had no control over.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She lost her power twenty years ago. It was during that great invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, Nozomu was surprised to hear the term "twenty years," but then he recalled that elves have a long lifespan of several hundred years compared to humans. He recalled that, from their perspective, twenty years was only a few years in the human sense of the word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She used to live in the forest of Nebula, but her homeland was destroyed by magical beasts, and she survived"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina lost her family there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's expression sank at Tom's words. But as if to drown out Nozomu's sadness, Mimuru smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not that unusual, everyone who survived that time has lost someone in their family. Tom's parents lost a sibling, too ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom also nodded in agreement with Mimuru.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-107"></a>The Sumayya Union was originally a group of countries that were disintegrated by the Great Invasion  and  then  reorganized.  Hence,  almost  everyone  has  been  affected,  in  one  way  or another, by the Great InvasionTom also nodded in agreement with Miml.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Smahya Coalition was originally a group of countries that were disintegrated by the Great Invasion  and  then  reorganized.  Hence,  almost  everyone  has  been  affected,  in  one  way  or another, by the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Me too. Nozomu-kun, what about your family?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My hometown wasn't hit by the Great Invasion, so I don't think anyone died there"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, that's very good of you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Torgrain, too, was from the union and had experienced the damage twenty years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His words of anguish and relief, which had stifled his mixed emotions, pierced Nozomu's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The other elves couldn't restore her ability to sense spirits?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When she released her magic power to make a contract, for some reason, the spirits around her seemed to run away in fear, and the other elves who tried to bridge the gap were also tilting their heads"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once he had spoken that much, Torgrein let out a big sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If one of the High Elves had survived, we might have found the cause of the problem ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The damage to the fairy tribe in the Great Invasion was also great. The fall of the Nebula Forest caused  them  to  lose  much  of  the  knowledge  and  experience  they  had  accumulated  over  the years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She is now unable to sense even the will of the surrounding fine spirits. There is no guarantee that this academy will be able to restore her abilities"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even so, Shina came to this city with a heart that was grasping at straws"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nebula Forest  borders the northern border  of the Sumayya Union  from the southern to central part of the continent via a buffer zone. In terms of its location with Arcazam, it is just across the land of the Cremazzone Empire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After that, Shina, lived in an elven refugee village until she came to Arcazam. But it must have been very difficult for her. After all, talking to spirits is as normal as breathing for them"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina  has  lost  not  only  her  family,  but  even  her  connection  with  spirits.  Her  situation  was similar to that of Nozomu, who lost all of his trustworthy people and emotional support due to the onset of his ability suppression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, who has now lost her power, was once a candidate for the High Elves, it is said"</p>
<p class="calibre1">High elves are elves who have made a contract with the spirit that resides in the great tree at the center of the Nebula Forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are only about a dozen or so of them in a single era, and they are those who can directly exercise the power of the "Spirit of the Great Tree," which can be said to be the core of the Nebula Forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-108"></a>Their ability to sense the spirits is unmatched by other elves, and in the past, a few high elves who have contracted with the spirits of the Great Tree have been able to defeat the armies of major powers with only a few people. They are truly the spiritual pillars of the elves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And her sister, who died during the Great Invasion, was also a High Elf"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing Sheena's situation, Nozomu felt a heaviness in his throat, as if he had swallowed lead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The reason she came to this city ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She came here to regain her connection with the spirits and to reclaim her home, the Nebula Forest. The Operation Fructus has stopped in her hometown.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The forests of the elves, which once boasted an iron-clad defense, have now become a hotbed of demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Operation Fructus has been postponed indefinitely due to the exhaustion of many countries, and  the  fact  that  the  deep  forests,  always  shrouded  in  fog,  are  clearly  unsuitable  for  the deployment of a large army is also adding to the stagnation of the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Nebula Forest was originally the land of the elves. The fact that they have not been able to take it back has made the elves even more vulnerable"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It wasn't solely the fault of the elves ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, the initial response of the elves in the Great Invasion was not flattering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the invasion of the demonic beasts had begun even before the fall of the Elven Forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not a problem that can be imposed on the elves alone, nor should it be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Nozomu's words, Torgrain put a complicated look on his face, and then he suddenly took out the pipe he had just been using.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He took out the spirit grass, which had already burned out, and instead put a cigarette in the pipe's mouth and lit it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The aroma of sweet purple smoke filled the laboratory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, yes, Not that all the people are blaming the elves, within the Union. But people are weak.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of them need to take out their feelings of inadequacy and stagnation on someone else"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Torgrain puffed on his pipe again, connecting the words with ......, especially those who had not yet regained their homeland.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu naturally bit his lip, an awkward expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Tom told me that for elves, making a pact with spirits is as natural as breathing.) For an elf to lose his spirit magic is equivalent to a bird falling to the bottom of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, his eyes suddenly caught sight of Mimuru and Tom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come to think of it, how did you two come to be with her?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">How did Tom and Mimuru become friends with Shina, the elf? Tom's downcast  expression turned into a wry smile as he pointed to Mimuru.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, that's because Mimuru was entangled with Shina when she first entered the school"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tangled, you say ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-109"></a>"Ah, I wasn't poking around like Calanti and the others. I was more talking to her, trying to get them to take classes with me and go out on the town with me. I was half-pushing her"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom let out a chuckle, perhaps remembering those days.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's words made Nozomu involuntarily turn her attention to Mimuru, who was sitting on a nearby chair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina  was  so  tense  and  moody  at  all  hours  of  the  day  and  night.  If  I'm  going  in  such  a wonderful school, I want to have a good time, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I mean, you want to make herself feel better at first?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right. Well, there are still some tough points just for elves, but recently she've started to react interestingly when I make fun of her ~~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom lets out a sigh as Mimuru grins and smiles mischievously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru, you should keep it in mind. Last time at the school, you got in trouble for putting something extra in Shina's bag"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Extra stuff?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,  instead  of  a  textbook,  she  put  in  a  love  story.  Of  course,  it  has  wet  scenes  and illustrations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not a romance novel, it's a sensual novel ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then Shina turned red and pulled my ear. Isn't that awful?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's you who's terrible. At least she's a victim ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu looked next to her, Tom was cowering with a wry smile on his face, as if he had no choice but to cower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As was the case when we met her at the library the other day, the most important reason for this Neko-tail girl's behavior seems to be whether or not it makes her happy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, Mimuru is like this. For better or worse, she's self-centered or sensual ....... I think it's her charm, though, that she's so open and honest"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Attractive? Tom, did you just call me attractive? Hyah~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I guess you didn't hear the first half of ......, hey, don't get stuck on me!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru leaps from the chair she was sitting in and pushes Tom down to the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cradling his head as hard as she could, she rubbed her cheeks against him and further entwined her legs with his. His brown-tail was buzzing and wagging.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's face was now covered in vermilion and she was beginning to take on a glamorous air, perhaps because she was so aroused.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good grief, Mimuru, you're still the same, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Torgrain, who was indeed annoyed at being flirted with in the laboratory, pulled Mimuru and Tom apart and stood them up, smiling bitterly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom patted his chest with a relieved expression, while Mimuru's mouth twitched in frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-110"></a>Meanwhile, Nozomu who knows about Sheena's situation looks sideways at the door of the lab she left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru smiled meaningfully at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you concerned about Shina?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it's not hard to see why. Shina's appearance is eye-catching because she is an elf. I'm not sure why you wouldn't be interested in her if she were a beautiful, light-skinned girl. Or is there some other reason you're interested in her?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's tone was teasing. But the glint in her eye that peeks out from the depths of her eyes is sharp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why do you care about Shina? Nozomu did not answer that question well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was surprised at Mimuru's sudden sharp look at him, but he was not deflated by it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was not enough to make him shrivel up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, on the other hand, retracted his eyes from Nozomu, who was silent, and this time his mouth relaxed into a quiet smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina is such a character. I don't think she'd want any pity down there"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'm guessing so .....)</p>
<p class="calibre1">That she does not want sympathy is naturally understandable given that attitude of hers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, while Nozomu admired Shina's attitude, he guessed that she might be pushing herself too hard somewhere. He himself had run away and focus to training, so his hunch was even stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you very much for ....... I will take my leave now"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu bowed and left Torgrain's laboratory</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom and Mimuru were watching Nozomu's back with interest.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After leaving the Groaurum institute, Nozomu headed straight back to his dormitory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun had set and it was getting dark.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was ruminating over Mimuru's words as he walked along the road to his dormitory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why do I feel so concerned about Shina Yuriel?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, her situation, as told to him by Tom and the others, would have elicited sympathy from an ordinary person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But if you ask whether Nozomu herself feels sympathy for her, she does not.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-111"></a>Originally,  she  clearly  harbors  a  bias  against  Nozomu  and  avoids  him.  It  is  difficult  to  feel sympathy for someone like that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I suddenly find myself wondering about her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fuuh, I shouldn't even be concerned about it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried to take a deep breath to refresh his mind, but then Nozomu's eyes caught sight of a flickering blue light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked up and saw a flickering blue light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Huh, What's that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  pale  light  peeking  through  a  gap  in  the  thick  forest  in  the  central  park.  The  light,  which clearly does not seem to be artificial, is shimmering like a shimmering flame of the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what it is ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is lured by the pale light and turns his attention to the central park.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  forest,  spreading  at  dusk,  was  already  enveloped  in  the  darkness  of  night,  partly  in  the shadow of the overgrown trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness, Nozomu saw a scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina Yuriel, a blue-haired elf, was standing there with azure magic rising from her body. The light that Nozomu saw was her magical light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The white face peeking out from the shadow of her long hair, which flutters with magic power, is beaded with sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone, please answer me ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the way Shina was calling out to someone who was not herself and from what she had just said in Torgrain's laboratory, Nozomu guessed that she was about to use spirit magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The scene from the fight with Tiamat came back to Nozomu's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, the giant dragon with its countless spirits magic created a swarm of light bullets that covered the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite her call, however, there was no change around her as she raged with magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,  perhaps  reaching  her  limit,  the  magic  she  was  releasing  faded  away,  and  Shina nodded off, exhaling roughly and placing her hands on her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once more!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She wipes off her sweat and begins to release her magic once more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the spirit still did not seem to respond to Shina's voice. Still, she did not want to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued to call out to the spirit over and over, again and over again, even if she got no response. Even if she gets no response.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  from  a  distance,  from  Nozomu's  point  of  view,  the  situation  was  both  terrifying  and painful at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-112"></a>And at the same time, he noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She  was  scorned  as  a  "dead  leaf  ear,"  but  she  continued  her  endless  efforts  to  regain  her hometown.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He realized that she was the same person he used to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a kind of homophobia. She was being held back in a way she did not want to be, and the way she was scorned by those around her was a reflection of herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was a definite difference between Nozomu and her. Because he was aware of his own kindred spirit, Nozomu also realized a clear difference between himself and her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">( Ah, I see... ....... She hasn't broken yet. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes have a strong light of will in them as she exhales roughly and calls out to the spirit while gasping for breath under the load of the magic she is releasing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her heart is not yet broken. She has not turned to training as a means of escape, as Nozomu has.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was precious to Nozomu and enviable at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... It would be tactless to peek any further, wouldn't it?) Nozomu turns on his heel so that Shina does not notice, and slowly walks away from the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He slowly walks away, stifling the bitter emotions swirling deep in his chest.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, Nozomu visited the Adventurers' Guild, curious about Garm's appearance near the city. The guild was still filled with the bustle and noise of students, but there was a tense atmosphere in the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know why. The other day, traces of a high rank demonic beast were found near the eastern outer wall of Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a particularly powerful individual among the demon with magical bearers. And this time, it was a direwolf. Since these demonic beasts act in herds, it is necessary to have a large number of them in order to defeat it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around the hall and checking the nameplates of the students at the reception desk, I saw  that  most  of  them  were  high  ranking  students.  When  a  high-ranked  demonic  beast  is confirmed in the vicinity of Arcazam, students of C rank or lower will not be able to receive requests in the forest. Therefore, the students who visit the Adventurers' Guild are themselves heavily weighted toward the high ranks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, among the students were school teachers, who do not usually visit the guild, and they were followed by several teams of students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The teams were qualified to take on the most difficult requests, but were still inexperienced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of them were younger than Nozomu and his classmate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two or three teachers in the guild, much fewer than the students, but they are also highly ranked and experienced.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-113"></a>Therefore, when they identify a high-ranking demon beast like this one, they sometimes lead and guide a team of students who have little experience with such requests yet but have great potential, considering the difficulty and importance of the request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me. ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, oh, it's you ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  meantime,  Nozomu  went  to  the  reception  desk  and  found  the  receptionist  who  had answered his call yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she confirmed that the visitor was Nozomu, she let out a somewhat tired sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um, you look tired, what in the world happened to ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing. And I have a nomination request for you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nomination Request. As the name implies, this is a request in  which the client nominates a specific person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is something that would not be done without the client's trust, and at the same time, it was recognized by the guild as proof that the person was an excellent candidate. Naturally, neither the receptionist nor Nozomu expected such a request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That, um, ...... why me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. Certainly you were in a party with that Irisdina Francilt ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Biting back a sigh that threatened to leak out, the receptionist presented the request form to Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened involuntarily when she saw the client's name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this from Mena-san?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meena Manat. She was the mature maid he had met the other day at the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The request was to escort Somia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi, Nozomu, I see you've come to the guild"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I suddenly heard a familiar voice and turned around to see a fully armed Irisdina standing there with a smile on her face. Behind her are Tima and Mars, also fully equipped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Iris, and Mars and others. Maybe the usual subjugation request?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, we were asked. I asked Mars to go with me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He nodded his head in response to Nozomu's question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can join in rank-wise, you know. You just need to show your strength and move up in rank too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was hoping you could help me out if you could ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looks disappointed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-114"></a>"Don't worry about it. It seems you have a lot going for you, too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Mars, Nozomu's current rank is D. He is not qualified to participate in this request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A pain tingled deep in his chest. Her concern itself was heavy on Nozomu's heart now that he was aware of his escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"More than that,....... I've come to call you by your nickname, but you still seem to retain your formal language"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps sensing Nozomu's expression, Irisdina smiles at him as if she is leaning toward him with a bit of a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same scene as on the previous date. However, Nozomu himself has been through this once before, so he is not used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless of his will, heat rises in his face just like that time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the surrounding gazes began to gather on Nozomu at once. Until now, they had been stares of suspicion, but this time, due to the close proximity to Irisdina, a large number of rather stiff killing stares were directed at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chills running down his spine and the burning heat on his face caused his face to repeatedly flicker red and blue like a lighthouse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you please move aside?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will if you fix your language"</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  more  unreasonable  demands  can  you  make  of  me,  young  lady?  Nozomu,  inwardly screaming, musters up all his strength and mutters a small murmur as if he is trying to push her out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can you get out of the way?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina poofed away. Nozomu plops down on the counter, breathless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist, who had been standing nearby watching the proceedings, gave Nozomu the coldest stare she could muster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ha ha ...... this again, Iris, will you please stop this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, teasing you is almost as much fun as Tima. I can't help it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, me too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, whose name was suddenly brought up, looks into her eyes with a tight-lipped smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, by the way, Tima. What's up with you and Mars-kun lately?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wh~what are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, perhaps shifting the focus from Nozomu to Tima, began to close the distance against Tima, this time with a swish.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-115"></a>Nozomu,  on the other hand, took  advantage of the situation to fade away. He tried to  be as invisible as possible so that he would not become a target again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, I felt like you two were kind of close today ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just your imagination"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really? For someone who denies it, your words don't seem to have the same sharpness?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's amused pursuit of Nozomu, whether she knew it or not, continued.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, what about that hair clip? You didn't have such a hair clip before."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Tima, not to be outdone, is ready to fight back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Oh, this. Nozomu gave it to me as a gift. It looks good on me, doesn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun gave it to you? Eh, for Ai? Wha~What?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Tima and Marsikun, you are ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell do you care? I'm about to start on a case, and you're making a big deal out of nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mu......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha! Yes, that's right. We're going into the forest now, so you should be a little more cautious too."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps annoyed by Irisdina's persistent behavior, Mars admonished her in a somewhat harsh tone. Tima was also struggling with Irisdina's unexpected attack, but she took advantage of the unexpected help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got away,...... well, time will tell while we're looking for the damn demon beast"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Nozomu, what kind of request did you get?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, well, I got a nomination request ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was puzzled, but showed Irisdeena the request form he had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, what one is it ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Irisdina saw the request form, her expression changed at once to one of dismay. From the look on her face, it seems that she too had no idea that Mena had made a request to Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the request was for the protection of her most cherished sister. It was no wonder she was perplexed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena Manat? Who is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Mars, who  was  peering into Nozomu's request  form  next  door, as was  Irisdina, asked Nozomu with his hand on his chin.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/p0Sw6GY/000014.jpg"<br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-117"></a>She is a new maid in the Francilt mansion. I heard that Iris's father told her to come to Arcazam. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this nomination request also about that one?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know about that ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars mentions that he is talking about the Waziart family case, but unfortunately, Nozomu does not understand why Mena has asked Nozomu to appoint him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, that may indeed be part of it, but if anything, Mena herself may be interested in Nozomu"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Irisdina dismissed the idea of Nozomu and Mars, who were concerned about the Rugato case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She scowled, covering her mouth with her thin fingers, a look of difficulty on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena is my mentor. She is one of the best swordsmen in her homeland"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... Why would someone like that be your maid?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words were met with a questioning look from Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If she is a swordmaster in the great kingdom of Forsina, her ability must be considerable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina had assured him that she was good with the sword, but at the very least, she was not the right person to be a maid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was originally a knight of high reputation, but apparently she had a lot of trouble in the past. It seems she was friends with my father and mother, and that's why she's been serving the Francilt family ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Irisdina also glanced at Nozomu with a reluctant look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only thing is, as a swordsman, she's an honest woman, for better or for worse. I am sure that the two of you will be able to find a way to make the most of your time together"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt a cold sweat running down his back again as he looked into her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, you should be careful. She's not so easy to deal with"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Be careful? What on earth will she do to me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anxiety suddenly flashed through Nozomu's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, smiled a meaningful smile, somewhat amused, and turned her back on him, ignoring Nozomu's questioning gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well then, Nozomu. Take care of yourself"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ai? Wait, wait, wait!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, hold on! -what's going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima and Mars hurriedly chased after Irisdina as she headed out of the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-118"></a>Nozomu, who was left behind, was bewildered and worried, alternately staring at the request form in his hand and at the girls as they left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Eh? What, what do I have to watch out for?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other party was a maid that service to a great noble. However, as far as I heard, I could expect them to be quite powerful, even among those who serve the Francilt family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right, I'm the one who's must thanked, so it's all good, right? Yeah, maybe ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deciding to head to the Francilt residence for the time being, Nozomu put the request form he had in his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think Iris and the others will be fine ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garms are indeed a menacing magical beast. A single village could be destroyed in a single night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was impossible not to be concerned. Still, there was nothing that Nozomu could do. He is not qualified to go with Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl had already gone outside, and the other high-ranked students had probably gone to the Spasim Forest, so the halls of the Adventurers' Guild were almost completely deserted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu let out an involuntary sigh at the empty scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, I know I shouldn't care, but ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's gaze is directed to the door of the hall where Irisdina and the others left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He understands that he was left alone as a result of his continued escape. However, the warmth and feeling of frustration that swirled deep in his chest did not disappear just because he had once regained the warmth and feeling of companion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the swirling desolation and frustration, along with a sense of heaviness, becomes a dissatisfaction that almost comes out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He even begins to feel disgusted with himself for harboring such dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really, I'm ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm a useless guy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu swallows the frustration that's threatening to rise to his throat as quickly as he can.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if he felt his own pettiness, it was the only thing he felt he should not say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the more he tried to shake it off, the more the frustration and desolation in his chest gradually grew without his noticing it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(For now, let's focus on what's in front of me ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu took a deep breath as if to change his mind, and left the guild to fulfill the request he had received.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After parting with Nozomu, Irisdina and the others visited the south gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-119"></a>This is because the Adventurers' Guild is located in the commercial district south of Arcazam, and this is the closest place to go to the Spasim Forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, they are surrounded by several parties of high-ranked students who have also received specially designated elimination requests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So what are you going to do? From what I've heard, the opponent this time is Garm. That being have highly intelligent, and even if he doesn't have a magic stone, he's a demon wolf who uses magic by nature. That's tricky. He seems to be the leader of the direwolves ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am confident that I can take on Garm by myself. The problem is the other herd. The last time we fought, it seemed it was just one of the herd that the head of the group was holding"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wolf herd are basically composed of related individuals called packs, but when a pack grows too large, some individuals leave the herd and form new ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, a powerful leader may have multiple herd under its control that are newly created by its own offspring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We could guess that this time the magical beast was one of its kind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then we need other people to help us ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The vanguard can be done by me and Mars-kun, so what we need is a midshipman and a rearguard. If we're thinking of searching for a herd, a scout familiar with the forest would be preferable."</p>
<p class="calibre1">So Irisdina huffed ...... and gave a small sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wish I had Nozomu's help. But I can't get his participation this time. Then ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's eyes turned to one of the groups gathered at the south gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, I would like to ask for your help ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina called out to a blue-haired elf and a girl from the cat-tail tribe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's that? It's the black-haired princess. Are you sure you want us?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, by the looks of it, you're a scout, Shina, and you know your way around the woods, too, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru is surprised when he speaks to her, but smiles with delight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way, Tom, what's up with Tom?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom is still in town for research. Besides, the objective this time is to defeat the demonic beasts, even if it's just to collect materials or something ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Mimuru, Tom himself is not good at fighting, so this time they came together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimul's ears drooped with a puff of air, perhaps because she was lonely, remembering the lover she had left behind in town.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Shina, after checking Irisdina's figure, began to look around as if she were seaching around looking for someone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's going on with him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You mean him ...... Nozomu? He didn't get this request because he's under-ranked."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-120"></a>"So ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was annoyed by Shina's somewhat relieved expression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not an obvious bad feeling like disgust, but it was a negative emotion with a hint of uneasiness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did something happen between you and him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's confusion led her to ask if something had happened between her and Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, actually, you know, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's no big deal"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina stopped Mimuru from answering Irisdina's question. Her eyes were filled with a stronger sense of avoidance than before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't bothering me. In the face of Shina's silent protest, Irisdina realized that she could not continue this conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, where are we going to start looking?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring Mimuru's attempts to appease her, Shina narrows the conversation to a meeting to discuss the defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The footprints of the ...... magical beast were found near the outer wall on the east side of the city. I think we should search the forest from there?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. Can Mimuru join us?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, that's all right, isn't it? Let's go then."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The course of action was to change the subject and indicate the course of action. The agreement expressed to the unchanged opinion created a different kind of tension between the two parties, as they were about to go out to defeat the demon beast.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming the location of the demonic beast's footprints from near the east gate of Arcazam, Irisdina and her party followed the footprints and entered the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The footprints of Garm, the leader of the group, were much larger than those of the others. In addition, there were also the footprints of other beasts around it. It was rather easy to follow the trail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To the east or to ....... If we continue this way, we will reach a tributary of the Vein River.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Vein is a major river that supports the logistics of Arcazam. It is fed by the Spasim forest and serves as the border between the Cremazone Empire and the Forsina Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Vein River is wide, and being the source of such a huge river, even though it is a tributary, the amount of water flowing through it is considerable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, the closer one gets to the tributary, the greater the proportion of mud and soil.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-121"></a>"Hmmm, I can see my footprints clearly now, but it's hard to walk with so much mud. ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's face was grim as she looked at the sticky mud clinging to the soles of her shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The footprints are so blatantly obvious. I'm probably being lured in~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tracks of the Garm as well as those of the other direwolves continue, but the number of tracks of its escorts is gradually decreasing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is conceivable that they are scattering to search for prey, but the way they scatter is odd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two or three of them are always grouped together, and they periodically leave the herd. The reason why they are not allowed to act alone is that they are anticipating an attack, and they are baiting the herd to detect the behavior of the pursuing animals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tension that had been building in the party rose in the face of the obvious invitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">" You'd better draw your weapons. You never know when they might attack"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The party nodded in agreement to Irisdina's words, and after pulling out their weapons, they began chasing after the tracks of the demon beast once again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon, the sound of rushing water gradually approached. The light coming from behind the overgrown trees gradually became stronger. The tributary was close.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There it is ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then they found the magical beast they had been aiming for.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge gray beast was sitting on a boulder beside a tributary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There it is. It's a garum. Quite big."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, sure, this is a big one"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has a body that is two or three times larger than that of a normal direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, "gray" eyes with deep intelligence turned toward Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You found it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The wind has stopped .... It's coming ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, three shadows jumped out from behind Irisdina and her friends who were hiding in the bushes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three direwolves attacked them. The three direwolves leapt at Shina and Tima, who were at the back of the pack, to thrust their fangs into them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu~tsu!'`Ze e i!'`Tei rya tto!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the fangs of the three beast did not reach them, and their lives were cut short in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, Mars, and Mimuru, who had responded immediately to the assault from behind, sent a flash of their weapons and slashed down the attacking direwolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uoooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distant howl of "The Gray" echoes through the air. Even though the first group has been annihilated, the wariness of the direwolves does not wane.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-122"></a>Newly emerged direwolves from the bushes surround Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They surround and distract them, and then bite them when they see an opening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how many people you surround yourself with, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shi~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's magic bullets and Tima's arrows fly and whiz by.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic and arrow, boasting an overwhelming distance between them, and the unmatched accuracy of their magic bullets and arrows, caught the direwolves that surrounded them, warped the walls of their encirclement, and pierced holes in them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ora a!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars charged into the hole and swung his great sword, which was covered with a blade of sheath of wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword roars and swings, and the magical bullets and arrows slaughter the slow-moving direwolves one after the other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, when a part of them jumps out, it naturally creates an opening in the formation of Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U~On!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other side of the protruding Mars. Another direwolf attacks from behind Shina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, sure, this is a roadblock!~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mimuru does not allow it. He has further enhanced his originally excellent beastman physical abilities with qijutsu, and with the suppleness of a cat, he is more agile than the direwolves. Wielding daggers in both hands, he slaughters the beasts that approach one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gururu......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" stood up on the boulder, its tail raised high, exuding anger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately afterward, magical power blasted up from the "gray" giant's body and swirled around its upraised tail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the air began to scream.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get down!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Irisdina's cry, everyone immediately got down on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, five blades are released from the "gray" tail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blades, woven together by magic power, flew at high speed and passed over the heads of Irisdina and the others who were lying on the ground. The blades cut down a tree in the direction they were traveling and gouged out the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The blade is very powerful, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-123"></a>"As expected of Garm. Even compared to the magical stone-bearer direwolves, it is an overwhelmingly powerful magical blade"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic blade of Garm will easily cut through a soft human body if it strikes directly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the other wolves try to jump on them when Irisdina evades the "gray" magic blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And, there are so many cronies!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While cutting down the dire wolves that jumped at her while she was down, Irisdina stood up and used her ability "Immediate Deployment" to refine her magic bullets, scattering them in all directions as if to tell them to stay away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The dire wolves were blocked from pursuit by a swarm of Irisdina's magic bullets, but their numbers did not seem to have decreased at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, "Gray" began to ramp up its magical power again. With a roar, the blade of magic power once again entwined with the raised tail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey! Wait, This is bad!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru raises a rushing voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, who was holding the bow next to her, took an arrow from the quiver on her back and placed it on the shaft.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an engraved arrow with Tom's characteristics. When Shina began to pour magic power into the arrow, the magic formula was activated. The arrowhead begins to heat up red hot, drawing in the surrounding magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shi~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Concentrating her mind, she shoots the arrow at the "gray"'s eyebrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The red-hot arrow slices through the air and flies in a straight line, piercing the gray's skull.</p>
<p class="calibre1">......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How could ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant fangs of the "Gray" easily bit down on the arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray", its entire body enraged with magic power, spat out the shattered remains of the arrow from its mouth and stared at Irisdina and Sina with a glare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woo-ooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, one of the direwolves surrounding Irisdina saw Irisdina and Sheena and let out a bellowing roar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes of the "gray" that heard the roar showed a strong color of anger. If you look closely, you can see that the direwolf that roared was a survivor of the magical stone-bearer that had been repelled on the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. So you want to avenge the deaths of your comrades ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" released the magical blades filled in its tail.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-124"></a>With a burst of sound, Irisdina kneaded her magic without hesitation in front of the five blades that were about to strike her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is a great deal, but that doesn't mean it can't be prevented"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Irisdina waved her arm, five magic bullets, the same as the approaching magic blades, were refined and shot out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to the "gray" magic blades, the magic bullets look obviously poor. However, Irisdina's magic bullets, flying through the air as gracefully as a fish, landed precisely on the belly of the approaching magic blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, with a sound like breaking glass, the "gray" magic blade was shattered and dispersed into four pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The horizontal strength of the blade is not as strong as the vertical strength of the blade"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is true that the magic of the "Gray" is very impressive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, because they were magical demon beasts, there was a definite roughness in the density of their magical blades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, there is no formula for the magic of these magical beasts. To use an analogy, they are like mudworks that have been forcibly hardened by force. Irisdina was simply exploiting that fragile point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if it is asked whether the same thing can be done to others, it is never the case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What we know and what we can do. There's a huge difference between what we know and what we can do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Moreover, when it comes to firepower, we have something special for you, too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, a magical power that even "gray" could not compare to blew through the area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That magical power erupted from the girl in the middle of the party, the one in the safest place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima Lime. If only for her magical power, she is the best wizard in the continent, let alone Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magical power concentrates in the staff she holds up. Two rings of refined magic. The blue and earth-colored magic circle floating in the air begins to rotate at high speed. A grating sound begins to echo in response.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" gaze turned to Tima, who was raging with magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The instincts that have survived in the Spasim forest for so many years, against her magic, a strong sense of danger is released, as if all the hairs on her body stand up on end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, Gray sprinted as fast as she could, driven by the alarming sound that rang in her brain. The target, of course, was Tima.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let me go!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mars, holding up a large sword, stood in the path of "Gray.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-125"></a>With his excess of energy, he strengthened his body with all his might to catch the "Gray" as he rushed forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two were locked in a tight fight. Mars blocked the fangs of the "Gray" that were about to bite him as if he was pressing down on him, by biting down on his great sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Mars and the "Gray" do not move slightly, as if their physical strength is completely equal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not bad!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no way out of this. Judging so, Mars pours his qi into the great sword and creates a blade of wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">qijutsu - dust wind blade. Suddenly, countless razor slews attempt to slice through the mouth of the "Gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, "Gray" also concentrates his magical power in his mouth and tries to push back while blocking Mars' dust wind blades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ga~uuu~uu~u……!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu, ō ō……!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Power and power opposing each other, magic and qi fighting each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The opposing magic power and qi burst forth with a tremendous roaring sound, blasting away Mars and the "gray". Mars and the "gray" are blown away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guu ha ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrrr ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and "Gray" were hit by the shockwave at close range, but it was "Gray" who regained his stance first.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" is a magical beast with an excellent physical structure and a four-legged physique that makes it easy to balance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guh ...... Tima, blow it away!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was still enough. The next moment, the magic that Tima had prepared was activated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Advanced magic "Crucifixion, burial, and funeral".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ground swelled around Tima, and countless earth-rooted spears and lances shot out and turned on the direwolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The spears spread out in concentric circles like a tsunami, swallowing up the "gray" and his men in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the tsunami of spears subsides, the body of the direwolf, pierced countless times, lies on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, who has finished using magic, exhales heavily from exhaustion. No matter how much magical power one has, the use of magic takes a toll on one's body and mind. Especially for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-126"></a>Tima, because of the enormous amount of magic power she possesses, the scale of her magic is large, and the burden tends to be correspondingly high.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wow~ amazing magic ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, it really is ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru and Shina, who no longer seemed to be at a loss for words, let out a sigh of admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They too knew the name Tima Lime, but when they actually saw her up close like this, the overwhelming difference in their abilities was undeniable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima Lime is not the only one. Irisdina Francilt, too, has a tremendous amount of talent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She accurately detects the defective parts of the magic blades that fly at high speed like the wind, and then precisely applies and shatters multiple magic bullets that she has kneaded in an instant. Who else but her could do such a thing?</p>
<p class="calibre1">An inexpressible jealousy welled up in Shina's chest. She understands the magnitude of what she has lost more than anyone else, and because she wants it more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What are you thinking? It's not their fault, but you're jealous of them .....) As if to shake off her own ugly jealousy, Shina lets out a sigh and looks around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking off her own ugly jealousy, Shina lets out a sigh and looks around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless dead direwolves lie on the muddy ground. The sheer number of them makes this disposal a vexing problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The corpses of demon beasts attract other beasts. Especially when there are so many of them, there is no telling how many demon beasts they will attract.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If it is not handled properly, there is a possibility that the magical beast that devoured this corpse will be prowling around the Alkazam area. It would be best to dispose of it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gururu ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, among the direwolves on the ground, there was one individual who stood up despite his wounds. It is "Gray," leader of the herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was indeed a special individual, and that vitality was unmatched by any other direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The body was pierced by multiple earth spears, bleeding, but he stood firmly on the ground with all four limbs and stared at Irisdina and the others with eyes filled with flames of rage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's really stubborn"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, from the amount of blood flowing out, we could already tell that this demonic beast's life was not going to be that long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the other party is a handcuffed beast. It is a beast that can easily slaughter a man with a single bite. We could not let our guard down until the last moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh dear, looks like you beat me to it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In that tension-filled place, a voice that did not belong to Irisdina and the others echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-127"></a>Emerging from the depths of the forest was a silver-haired beastman. It was Kevin Ardinal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind him were about 20 party members, whom he seemed to be leading.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kevin ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Irisdina. Looks like you weren't done yet"</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that Kevin and the others had also been fighting with demonic beasts somewhere, and their clothes were stained with dirt and blood everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The smell of blood on their clothes made "Gray" change the color of his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrr ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, I got all your other guys"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Kevin and the others were fighting with a part of the herd led by "Gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray," who had killed all of the people under command, attacked Kevin with a rage of indignation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuuoooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He poured all his remaining magic power into it and released a magic blade while making a screeching sound, as if he was going to lead at least one person astray.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yotto ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin does not look particularly nervous in the face of the approaching "gray" and the magical blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sits back and grips the ground firmly with both feet, his fists full of energy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's weapons are the black cuirasses on his arms and legs. The color contrasts with his school uniform, which is based on white, making his small hands stand out even more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hmph!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a short exhale, he flashed his fist. The sword shatters the "gray" magic blade with a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He continues, clenching his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Continuing, he activates his flash step while clenching his fists. Diving into the bosom of the approaching "Gray" in an instant, Kevin draws back his left hand that he swung down, and as if in tandem, he unleashes his right fist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Legs, hips, and torso. Everything was in perfect coordination with the fist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the next moment, there was a sound like a burst of air and a flash of light. A blow was released in the manner of a hook, striking "Gray" in the left side of the body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact shattered his ribs, and at the same time, a thunderbolt struck him, destroying his left lung and heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the last of it. ...... Sorry, Irisdina, for finishing it off"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin waved his hand toward Irisdina as he took one look at the crumbling "gray" and waved it in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-128"></a>The whole group, with the exception of Irisdina and Tima, looked wide-eyed at Kevin, who, even though he was wounded, was able to shatter that magic blade with his hand and inflict a fatal wound with a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's fast,..... Besides, that blow just now, it was like a lightning strike ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, it's 'Qi Lightning Transformation'. It's Kevin's ability to transform the qi he's kneaded into lightning."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Neri Ki Lightning Transformation. As the name suggests, this ability converts qi into lightning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The converted lightning moves as the manipulator wishes, and even though it is fixed in the form of lightning, unlike magic, it was an ability that made possible the inherent speed of qijutsu, which requires no chanting time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His quickness of attack meshed surprisingly well with Kevin's physical prowess and fighting prowess.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, he mortally wounded Garm with a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">."Gafu, gehyu…… gehugh ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, despite having one lung and heart crushed, "Gray" was still alive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a stubborn guy ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin was poisoned by the "gray," which did not die instantly, and drew his fist in an attempt to finish it off this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the next instant, "Gray" gathered his last bit of strength, put magic power all over his body, and leapt from the spot in a single bound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Followed by a bang! and a splash of water and the "gray" fell into a tributary of the Vein River.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The body of the big wolf is swallowed by the violent river current, and in the blink of an eye, it disappears downstream, out of sight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn, escaped by sheer stupidity in a fire. What a life force, even though I crushed the heart and one lung ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">" Well, the leader. It's a mortal wound anyway, and it will go down soon enough"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We missed the proof of defeat, so it will take some time to confirm it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Kevin's mouth twists in frustration, his cronies look downstream and mutter optimistically.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if they had inflicted mortal wounds, if they did not actually identify the bodies and take proof of defeat, they would receive only modest rewards and recognition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, Calanti, a member of Kevin's party, opened his mouth to Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kareha Ears, have you been hiding behind someone? You're still good at using people as shields, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-129"></a>"Shut up ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, you're just mad because I hit the nail on the head, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman who originally did not hide her dislike for Shina glared at her with a sharp gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was not offended, but rather her expression became even more abusive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina opens her mouth, scowling uncomfortably at Karanti, who is entangled with Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But before Irisdina could utter a word, a dignified voice other than hers rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kalanti, and all off you, shut your mouth. They are the ones who defeated this herd of monsters. We only killed the small fry among the herd at best, and we failed to finish the leader. If they are half-baked, we will be less than half-baked."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, that ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's words made Calanti clam up as if he were upset. In fact, what Kevin and his group were fighting until they got here was only a part of the herd that the "gray" had scattered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The sun is already setting ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun was already setting and the forest was beginning to be tinted with the colors of twilight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When night falls, the threat of demon beasts increases dramatically. They should not stay too long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We had no choice. That's enough for today"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Kevin's voice, his party started to head back to Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and the others buried the remains of the direwolf they had killed with Tima's magic, and soon after, they were on their way home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As they leave, silence returns to the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only sounds are the wind and the rustling of leaves, and as the darkness of night begins to cover the forest, the grass growing on a tributary of the Vein River rustles and shakes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peering out from behind the bushes are crimson eyes. The blood-red eyes were staring downstream, as if searching for something.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">A tributary of the Vein River. In the ford by the winding riverbank, a wounded garm was washed up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gehü ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mouth opened weakly, and with a weak exhalation, the few remaining drops of blood were spat out.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-130"></a>The body was already shredded. The blood overflowing from the collapsed heart and lungs had accumulated in the body, completely destroying it's normal breathing and blood circulation functions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering that the heart was crushed, it is a miracle that the guy is still breathing. It was a coincidence that it was instinctively using the excess magical power to sustain the life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But that was the end of the limit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The flickering vision finally closes in darkness. As consciousness fades, "Gray" grieves over the failure to avenge the death of all fallen family, but it continues to burn with hatred.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gafu …"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, at the edge of its fading vision, something is there.</p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1">
<p class="calibre1">It was a black, muddy stagnation that was gushing out of the gravel on the riverbank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The stagnation eventually becomes a spherical mass in mid-air, and as it approaches the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gray," which remains suspended in mid-air, motionless as if it has a will, it touches its body, and as if soaking into it, it burrows into the inside of its body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guh, guh ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">An inarticulate scream escapes from the "Gray"'s mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vision that was about to disappear turns red and flickers repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" limbs, which had been thrown to the ground, begin to regain strength, and along with that, the gray body hair gradually begins to turn black.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gwuuggghh..... Guooooooooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" that had been thrown up with a giggle...... roars out into the dark night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its physique was painted jet black, and its eyes had somehow turned blood red.
