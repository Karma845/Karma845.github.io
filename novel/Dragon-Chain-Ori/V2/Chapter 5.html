<h3>Chapter 5: Distortion of the Swordsman, Germination of the Girl</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Following the request form, Nozomu once again visited the Francilt Mansion and was ushered directly into the waiting room with a face-pass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Nozomu  was  feeling  unspeakably  embarrassed  by  the  maids  and  butlers  who  bowed reverently to him, the door to the waiting room opened and Somia and Mena appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry to keep you waiting, Nozomu-sama."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good afternoon, Nozomu-san!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, good afternoon, Somia-chan. So, Mena-san, I think  you mean an escort ..... Perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kusu, don't get me wrong. It is not that Somiliana-ojo sama is in danger."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I talked to Mena about inviting Nozomu-san one more time, and when I did, she ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, the truth is that Mena, having heard Somia's request, made a nomination request to the Adventurers' Guild and summoned Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was smiling at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena has an unwavering smile, but Nozomu can't help but feel that her words are a little bit too much, partly because of Irisdina's words at the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But a request is a request. Nozomu exhales heavily to regain his composure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. I'm going to be with Somia-chan for the time being, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, until Irisdina-ojo sama returns, please take care of her."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With Nozomu's approval, Mena quietly bows her head and leaves the room without further ado.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well then, Somia-chan, what do you want to do?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm e~tto, first of all, let me show you around the mansion!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was as cheerful and full of life as ever, and Nozomu followed her with a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was then taken on a tour of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In their previous visit, they had no time to do so because of the battle with Rugato, but this time they were able to carefully look around each facility, partly because now Nozomu had Somia with him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, after visiting the Francilt mansion, Nozomu was so overwhelmed that he could only give a poor impression of the place: 'It's really amazing'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the salon. It's a little small, but when my friends come over, we have tea here."</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-132"></a>"No, this room is as big as my parents' house ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the kitchen. This is where the chefs who cook for us work."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's a pile of spices in the corner of the room that I've never seen before, where did you get them from?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the bathroom. Not only me and my sister use it, but also the servants of the house."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's as big as a pond, how do you heat it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some of the servants can use magic, even if only briefly."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The scale is huge. In addition, everything he saw, in terms of decoration and performance, was a world apart from the stuff used by commoners.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After touring the mansion, Nozomu was taken to the garden. The two of them sit on a bench and watch the plants in the garden bathed in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I should have known, but it's so ...... overwhelming when you show it to me again."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"E~etto. I'm sorry, Nozomu-san. I was so excited ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, Somia doesn't have to apologize, I'm not sure how much I can take. I'm just not used to this kind of place ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While it was certainly full of surprises, the feeling of fatigue that enveloped my body was not an unpleasant one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, it was very exciting and inwardly thrilling, just because he was able to see so many things he did not know.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tried to distract Somia by smiling and patting her head. The feel of her silky black hair danced happily in his palm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ni ~yapu, au au ..... Nozomu-san, it's embarrassing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahaha, sorry, sorry, I just couldn't resist petting you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia's eyes narrowed like a kitten's, and my feelings eased. The feeling of frustration and impatience that had been tingling in my chest at the guild also became a little lighter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That reminds me, I have a little favor to ask of you, Nozomu-san."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilts his head at Somia, who looks up at him as she strokes his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you like to accompany me in for my training?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Training?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia returned to the mansion and brought a wooden sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is it ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you training in swordsmanship?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-133"></a>"Surprising?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surprising, I mean, I felt like Iris wouldn't allow it ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think so. Sure, she gave me a complicated look at first, but my sister wouldn't stop me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She also seems to be learning magic, but Irisdina is rather willing to teach her, even showing her demonstrations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I guess that's how much she really cares about her sister. Normally I'd make her stop .....) Irisdina took up the sword to protect her sister. It is because she wants her sister to be free, carefree, and above all, smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why she is respecting Somia's wishes in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So why me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-san, you are so strong that my sister approves of you. It was Nozomu-san who defeated that oldman vampire , too ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, I use katana sword, so I'm not sure how much I can teach ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Swordsmanship (Kenjutsu) and katana swordsmanship (katana-jutsu). The way they use their bodies is similar but different. A sword that strikes and cuts, and a sword that cuts and splits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The way of swinging a sword and the way of holding a sword are also different.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, Nozomu himself had never taught others. He had no confidence at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would be happy if you could just look at me and point out what is bothering you. Can you do that for me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, when she looked up at him as if clinging to him, Nozomu could not say no.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the meantime, Nozomu decided to have Somia swing the sword a few times and observe how she did it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ei, ei!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lovely sound echoed through the garden of the Francylte mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She swung down from the upper level about 20 times. At first, she looked good, but then, perhaps because her body was smaller than that of her peers, she gradually become more shaky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hā, wa a ...... So, how did it go?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? Un~tto, let's see ..... I feel like you still lack the basics. Your hands are moving first when you swing the sword, and as you get tired, your patterns are slowly falling apart."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see, that means I still have a long way to go."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia let out a big sigh in response to Nozomu's frank impression, as if to say, "I knew it".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, she herself is aware that she still lacks the basics.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia-chan, are you going to be a swordsman?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-134"></a>It sounds a little harsh, but Somia, with her small stature, is clearly not suited to be a swordsman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is because she was originally born prematurely. Of course, this may be resolved depending on future growth, but it is a story that cannot be guaranteed at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, ...... I don't really know. But I don't think we should do nothing, so I guess we're just doing things as we go along."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While her gaze swam in the air for a moment in response to Nozomu's question, Somia made it clear that he had not yet made up his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, if you ask me if I am not influenced by my sister, I would say not at all. As I said before, I admire my sister."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She turns back the wooden sword she was wielding earlier and smiles a radiant smile. There is no trace of self-deprecation in her smile, as she was born prematurely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are few people who can honestly accept their own shortcomings when they are pointed out to them. Some people, no matter how old or how young they may be, are upset when others point out their shortcomings. On the contrary, there are even those who escape from the reality that is no one's fault but their own and others'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'm one of those people myself ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As he looked at Somiliana, who was smiling at him, Nozomu once again realized that this girl was strong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In that sense, she has the potential to grow a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was thinking about this, Mena approached Nozomu and the others with a towel from the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good evening, Somiliana-ojo sama, Nozomu-sama."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, Mena-san, hi."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ojo-sama, this way please. I have also prepared a change of clothes for you, so why don't you go ahead and change your clothes?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, thank you, Mena! I will do so."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accepting the towel Mena brought, Somia wipes the beads of sweat from her forehead and returns to the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you practicing swordsmanship?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not really practice, I was just watching a few moves. The first thing I noticed was that Somia was using an ordinary straight sword."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The young lady has only recently started learning to use a sword, and her focus is more on her other studies."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-135"></a>As for Nozomu, he had no image of Somia using a sword. The reason is that the sword is not a simple thing to use. If she did, she would have picked up a thin sword like Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So, unlike Irisdina, Somiliana's sword is only a mere taste.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was right, and Somia herself did not seem to be that committed to becoming a swordsman yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, it is probably still really just a preference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu glanced at the maid in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had long, light purple hair in a braid and a straight back like a stick. Her appearance was similar to Irisdina's. Her whole body emitted an atmosphere similar to that of a well-honed sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Iris told me that Mena is Iris's ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, I did. With all due respect, sir... I've had the honor of being Irisdina-ojo sama sword instructor before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can see it up close and personal. She is a skilled swordsman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her appearance is just like a sword in its scabbard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her physical prime may be past, but even the brilliance of the sword wielded by her hand has not diminished in the slightest. This woman hides a high spirit in her natural behavior that makes us believe so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-sama has no information on why Irisdina-ojo sama is running to be the next head of the family ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have heard that it was because of a promise she made to Iris's mother who passed away</p>
<p class="calibre1">......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. If the young lady has told you that much, then I guess I don't have anything to say."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Nozomu's words, Mena's cheeks relaxed slightly. Her expression seemed somehow relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the momentary loosening of her cheeks disappeared immediately, and instead, a somewhat misanthropic smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But still, you seem to get along very well with each other, calling each other by such nicknames."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"E, ē tto, you know, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  The fact that such a young lady is so open-minded, suggests that you are as good-natured and easy to understand as you appear to be."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt a little complicated when he was told that he was easy to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was wondering if he was that easy to understand, Mena was taking a curious look at the sword Nozomu had at his waist.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-136"></a>Nozomu-sama, since this is your chance, why don't the two of us cross swords for a moment?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was taken aback by Mena's sudden offer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"With Mena-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am very interested in your skills in fighting off the S-ranked opponents."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes reminded Nozomu of the dull brilliance of a sword blade, and he felt his whole body awash in agony.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, heat surged up from deep inside his body. His mouth naturally tightened at the sword-like feeling that was directed at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu did not know how much Irisdina had told him about the details of that battle, but at least he had not told them anything about the power of Tiamat that he had taken in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, Nozomu had not released his ability suppression since the battle with Rugato.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The nightmare he had after the battle. The nightmare of the giant dragon destroying Arcazam has been smoldering deep in his chest, making him anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It' s fine, I will use a real sword, but I won't hit you with it. It's just like a little practice."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pushing down the anxiety and agitation that welled up in him, Nozomu agreed to Mena's proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He believed that if he did not release his ability suppression, there would be no signs of nightmares at the moment and he would not be noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, he was worried that he would be detected, but he also thought that refusing the proposal at this point might make people suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was good. Then we will begin when Somiliana-ojo sama returns."</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Nozomu's approval, which came naturally from her mouth, Mena relaxed her eyes, smiled, and quietly moved to the middle of the garden. Then she brushes off her skirt with her right hand, and before she knows it, she has a thin sword in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if caught by her, Nozomu also steps forward and faces Mena once again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? What's going on, you two?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quietly weakens his entire body and slowly draws the sword at his waist, while listening to Somia's voice as she returns to the garden.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena also quietly raises the tip of her thin sword, as if in response to Nozomu's sword drawing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a sound of Somia's stifled gasp, the two swordsman's sword fight quietly begins.</p>
<p class="softbreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-137"></a>†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and the other returned to the Adventurers' Guild and went straight to the reception desk to report what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll check it out, the leader of the monsters escaped with a mortal wound. But the chances of survival are extremely low."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, that's for sure."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The guards will search the forest tomorrow. Considering the fact that the majority of the herd has been killed, we can be almost certain that the request will be fulfilled."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, what was the size of the herd led by Gray Garm?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was much larger than we had initially anticipated. The number of the individuals you have defeated is about a hundred. Ten of them had magic stones."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and the others frowned at the fact that the herd was much larger than they had expected. The actuality that the direwolves they encountered were only a part of that "gray"</p>
<p class="calibre1">herd, but the size of the herd was much larger than they had expected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If they had not been able to defeat them, there was a strong possibility that they would have caused considerable damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, there was another high-ranking party that had received the request, so they took care of it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it Kevin Ardinal?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, and a party of Lisa Hounds, Ken Notis, and Camilla Vecknose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I glanced in the direction of the receptionist and saw Lisa and her colleagues reporting at another counter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They are ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, They defeated about 30 direwolves that had been appearing on the road again. Of them, five were carrying magic stones."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual number of the wolves killed is more than Irisdina and her party, but considering the fact that only three of them did it, it's quite a feat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But more than the results of the defeat, Irisdina is concerned about them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feud between Nozomu Bountis and them. Because she knows about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist, on the other hand, is smiling cheerfully at the fact that the defeat of the demon beasts was completed without any damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As one would expect from the highest ranking students of the Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, with such a large group, we would have organized a hundred-man strike force to deal with it. This should ease logistical and civilian concerns."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist expressed her admiration and praise, and Irisdina smiled back, but her attention kept turning to her red-haired classmate.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-138"></a>At that moment, Lisa and Irisdina's gazes crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Tima, I'm sorry. Can I leave you in charge here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh? Wait, hey Ai!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if quick to say so, Irisdina left Tima in charge of the direction to the reception desk and walked toward Lisa and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa, upon seeing Irisdina approaching, narrowed her eyebrows with a disgusted expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa, what's wrong ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken Notice and Camilla Vecknose, who were next door, also noticed Irisdina coming up beside them and looked surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... what can I do for you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina nodded inwardly to Lisa, who was clearly alarmed, saying, "I knew it ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two were originally rivals in practical skills, but her voice sounded more stiff than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry for the sudden interruption. Can I talk to you for a minute?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... It's fine. Let's go somewhere else."</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa led Irisdina to a coffee shop named "Fountain of Red, White, and Black Cherry Blossom" in the commercial district.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They sat facing each other at a round table outside the store, with Ken and Camilla sitting on either side of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina asked for tea and pastries for the appropriate number of people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the waiter puts down the steamy tea cups, Irisdina takes one in her hand. The bright golden color of the tea, which is probably made from the finest tea leaves, gives off a healthy, youthful flavor that is unique to black tea.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's cheeks relaxed slightly at the aroma. The pleasant aroma of tea, which seemed to contradict the tension-filled battlefield she had just been in, relaxed her shoulders to a propher degree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's bad right. I got a treat."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I invited you. Don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps feeling better about the good tea, Lisa's expression had relaxed somewhat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Although, what I'm about to tell you will definitely touch their reverse scales ......) Irisdina could tell from the tension Lisa had been feeling at the Adventurers' Guild that the story of Nozomu was still off-limits to the girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what's the talk?</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-139"></a>"Nozomu Bountis, you know him, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough, at the mention of Nozomu's name, Lisa's expression instantly became intense.</p>

<a href="https://ibb.co/1b2vG5z"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8X8KgpY/000007.jpg" alt="000007" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-141"></a>Then, her entire body emitted an angry air, and she began to glare at Irisdina. At this blatant rejection, Irisdina inwardly sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world did that traitor do?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla, who was sit next to Irisdina, opened her mouth in place of Lisa's, who had tightened her mouth into a straight line, saying that she had no intention of talking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I just wondered what kind of person he was, since I've had a bit of a connection with him lately."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina quickly shifted her gaze to Lisa while taking one look at Camilla who suddenly interrupted her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Receiving a silent stare, wanting to hear it from you, Lisa slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the silent stare, wanting to hear it from you, Lisa slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You already know."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa's answer was a smoke screen. However, the look of rejection in her eyes told us all we needed to know about her feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, I know he's a scumbag who betrayed his childhood love who supported him."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If it's the case."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that's just a rumor. I have not actually seen or heard anything about it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But that's not enough for Irisdina to back down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is usually an exemplary honor student, but like the aristocrat she is, she is often pushy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I said earlier, I've had a bit of a connection with him lately. I've had a chance to get to know him a little, and he's a good guy. I can't leave him alone. I don't think he is the kind of person who would betray others."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's true. He's ..., that guy ...!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps too emotional, the next moment, crimson magic erupted from Lisa's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa!" "Kyaaa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only the customers visiting the same store, but even the passersby on the sidewalks were startled by the sudden gust of wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... Sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken's words brought Lisa back to her senses. The outpouring of magical energy had calmed down, and the guests around her were wondering how Lisa and the others were doing, but they were back to their daily conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"... The connection between me and him was through my sister. There were many things, but he was the one who helped my sister who was in danger."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had been watching Lisa as she closed the doorplate tightly, now began to take the opposite approach.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-142"></a>She began to tell Lisa about the connection between her and Nozomu, even though she blurred it in places, and encouraged Lisa to talk to her herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a very gentle and reassuring air about him. I can see why you were once attracted to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop it. ....... He didn't care about his promise to me after all ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Promise?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa, that's enough. Let's go."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps unable to watch the dejected Lisa, Camilla suddenly interrupts them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had been interrupted, turns her gaze to Camilla, who has interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla-kun, we still need to talk ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">We have nothing to talk about. We have nothing to say to you. Or what, the Francilt's daughter is so uncomfortable that even here in Arcazam she has to do what she wants? This is why aristocrats are so ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not that I would have said otherwise. But this is between me and you, Lisa-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla's words, which were clearly imbued with disgust and malice, made Irisdina's reply more forceful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Camilla did not back down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It doesn't matter. I am in a party with Lissa. If my friend and colleague was being harassed by a third party, I would feel compelled to intervene."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The word "third party" made Irisdina's brow furrow. The heart, which had been as calm as the surface of a lake in winter, began to stir.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know what your relationship is with him, but you have nothing to do with this, do you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Camilla takes Lissa's hand, who is still lying on the table next to her, as if to spit out a one-sided word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa, let's go."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She forces Lisa to stand and Camilla leaves the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina reflexively stands up and tries to call them off, but in the end she is unable to speak to them as they leave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sits back in her seat with a sigh and sips at her tea, which is now a little lukewarm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken, the only one left in front of her, opens his mouth with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Irisdina-san. Camilla was rude."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did something happen to her, too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know, but I know she has some kind of animosity toward you nobles."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-143"></a>A few seconds of silence passed between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken let out a sigh as he let his gaze drift away from Irisdina, who was staring at him as if she was trying to spy on him, and then he let his gaze fall on the tea remaining in his cup and drank it all in one gulp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You seem to be in Nozomu's debt, but you shouldn't be fooled. He's the one who betrayed not only Lisa, but also mine."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"May I ask what happened?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it. It's not something we want to remember. But I can tell you this. The rumors are true, just like Lisa said."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, but that's odd ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's meaningful words bring Ken's gaze back to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am sure Lisa-kun is not lying to me. As I said before, I have confidence in my ability to look people in the eye."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's interpersonal experience is considerable. She has lived in aristocratic society since she was a child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, she was sensitive to people's lies. Her gaze, body movements, and voice modulation. She understands the characteristics of people who lie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from her point of view, she could assure me that there was no lie in Lisa's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have asked Nozomu about what happened with Lisa-kun, and he clearly said he didn't cheat on me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then Nozomu is lying."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, he is not lying. The expression on his face at that time was as hurtful as Lisa's."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, she is convinced that Nozomu is also not lying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That proves the contradictory situation of Nozomu and Lisa, who make diametrically opposed claims, yet both are not lying. And if they have been crossing paths for such a long time, then .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I honestly thought that the rumors that were spreading around the school were groundless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But maybe it's not true."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looked at Ken, who was looking down at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You think I'm lying?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken's eyes begin to show a hint of anger, as if he is offended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not saying that. But I just think we need to know more details."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really? I don't think you need to know more details. Because you and he are from different backgrounds, from different places, everything."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their relationship would never have been possible without the Solminati Academy, which attracts students from all over the continent, regardless of their status.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-144"></a>And once they graduate, the relationship naturally breaks off. That is normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So leave them alone. Don't get involved. Ken says so in his own words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that's a meaningless what-if. I already owe him a great debt of gratitude that I cannot repay."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, however, maintains a resolute attitude. The first time I saw her, Ken's gentle eyebrows lifted slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I said before, this is a matter of our past and Nozomu's. You have no right to be involved in this matter in the first place."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken exhaled heavily and abruptly got up from his seat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a little worried about you two, so I'm going with you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I thought you'd be a little more sober."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken's gaze is directed to Iris Dina's hairpiece as she gets up from her seat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who gave you that cheap hair clip? You've put a lot into it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken's mocking expression is directed at Irisdina's hair clip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's eyebrows naturally lifted and wrinkled between the brows. The heat and discomfort, which is incomparable to the time when she was talking to Camilla just a few minutes ago, came up from deep inside her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Like I said before, you should leave him right away. That way you won't get hurt."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, watching Irisdina's reaction, Ken erases the smile that had been on his face earlier and spits out a terribly cold remark.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but that's for me to decide. As I said before, I have confidence in my ability to look people in the eye."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then your eyes are still cloudy. Because Lisa and Camilla saw him betray us."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Ken turned on his heel and walked away as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who was left behind, drank down her remaining tea, leaned back in her chair, and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（I don't know what's going on with me. He doesn't seem to be lying, but it feels awfully strange.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she has no way to clarify further, as she knows nothing about the details of what happened to them at that time, even though she feels uncomfortable about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Surely, it's not something I should get into. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe it's a big deal. However, the image of him pleading his innocence, stifling his emotions, was inevitably stuck in her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-145"></a>Irisdina gently reaches for the hair clip he gave her. The smooth feel of glass returns to her fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（I wonder why. My heart tingles a little. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I just wanted to return the favor to him for saving my sister. This was my action out of that feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the result only leaves you with an indescribable sense of discomfort and frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking her head to shake off the anguish, Irisdina places her finished cup on the saucer, gets up from her seat, and heads for her residence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before she knew it, the sun had completely set and the twilight was illuminating the clouds in the sky.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the moonlit garden of the Francilt mansion, Nozomu and Mena face each other with their weapons at the ready.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We'll begin then."</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance is about ten metres, a distance that can be closed in two breaths if you use magic or qijutsu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena's thin sword, raised in the air, is gently wielded in small increments. The meeting was held at her request, but the moment they met, Nozomu was struck by a sensation that sent a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Iris said she was quite a skilled wielder, but this is ......) Nozomu changes his stance several times as he watches his opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I see, she said she wasn't going to hit me, but if I let my guard down, I'm going to be covered in holes in an instant.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matching Nozomu's movement, Mena also subtly changes the movement of the tip of her fine sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two are now in a state where they are both looking for the other's movements. There is no fierce exchange of blows, but that is why it is necessary to maintain a high level of concentration so as to be ready to move at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tension is so intense that it is almost tingling. Somia, who was watching over them, was also absorbed in their swordsmanship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, hit by the numbing air, involuntarily cocks and clears her throat. The next moment, Mena moved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, her entire body was filled with qi, and then, poof! With a burst of sound like a burst of air, she leaps into Nozomu in a single bound. The speed was second only to Shino's among those Nozomu had seen so far.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-146"></a>"~Tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also reflexively moves to intercept the thin sword that is thrust into him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He strengthened his whole body with qi, and at the same time, he struck his weapon with qi to create an ultra-thin blade. Tilting his sword slightly, he interrupted the blade into the path of the thrusting thin sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gyaririri! With a grating metallic sound, the trajectory of the thrust is deflected to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was no way that Mena's offensive could end with a single thrust. The thin sword is drawn back and immediately launched into a volley of blows that hits Nozomu like a shower of rain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu~tsu ....!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was instantly pushed back by a barrage of hip thrusts. He continues to deflect the thrusts by stepping backward with his slip to escape the pressure, but he is unable to respond in time to the barrage of high-speed strikes from the shortest possible distance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if they were to strengthen their bodies with qi in the same way, there was still an overwhelming difference in the efficiency of qi between Nozomu, who has suppressed his abilities, and Mena, who is an expert with a thin sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Fast, overwhelmed ....... Then!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu narrowed his timing to one of the countless thrusts and stepped forward at the same time as he deflected it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He then advanced his body in time with Mena's movement to draw back the thin sword, folded his arms, and twisted his hips.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The slash was both evasive and offensive, like a cleave to the torso.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mena dexterously slips the fine sword with her attention into the path of Nozomu's slash, even though it is inside the fine sword's spacing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, she leapt backward. She landed softly, carefully parrying Nozomu's blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A good decision to combine offense and defense."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Nozomu went on the offensive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He activates his kijutsu flash step. Accelerating at once, he attempts to jump into Mena's bosom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena, who saw Nozomu's flash step, moved to intercept.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She stepped forward with her right foot and, making the most of her thin sword and the length of her arm, she timed her attack perfectly, matching the speed of the onrushing Nozomu at the apex of the gap where the tip of her sword would accelerate the most.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-147"></a>Before Mena's arm could fully extend, however, Nozomu's reflection in her vision blurred.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, Nozomu's body, without slowing down at all, escapes from Mena's sting like a snake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flash step - Curved style. This is a technique in which Nozomu uses his excellent sense of balance and bodywork to bend the trajectory of his flash step at will.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as he dodges Mena's thrust, Nozomu's body cleave is unleashed with the momentum of his flash step - curved style.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mena, who had avoided the thrust, was no slouch either. She pulls back her left leg, opposite her right leg, and brings back her elbow, letting her qi-infused thin sword cut into the path of Nozomu's slash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ging! With a high pitched clash, Nozomu and Mena crossed each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a great trunk control. I didn't expect you to be able to change course at will without slowing down your speed......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While flipping her maid's uniform, Mena was genuinely admiring Nozomu's skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a swordsman who uses qi, Mena herself has a certain amount of confidence in her techniques, including the flash step but even so, she knew that the technique that Nozomu had just demonstrated was of a very high level of difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, the fact that he was able to perform such advanced techniques naturally and without delay gave Mena a firsthand impression of Nozomu's skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena-san! You just completely hit me right in the forehead! If I couldn't avoid it, I would be dead!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't think this would be enough for someone who has fought and survived against someone equivalent to S rank. At that moment, I was convinced that Nozomu-sama's ability had definitely reached A rank."</p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened to the "I won't hit you!" Nozomu protested, shouting from the pit of his belly, but Mena assured him with a nonchalant look on her face that she was surely able to avoid it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that her mouth, which had been closed in a straight line just a moment ago, is slightly lifted up. Apparently, she is quite agitated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh man, this person is the same type of person as my master ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is far superior to even me, especially when it comes to handling qi. I didn't think it was even difficult to prevent ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a loose-lipped smile, Mena raises the thin sword in her hand. If you look closely, you can see two scars on the belly of the blade. They were inflicted by Nozomu's phantom blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wounds were so deep into the core of the blade that her thin sword had already become useless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think any half-baked qijutsu or enhancement magic will be able to compete with this."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-148"></a>She tossed the sword with the dead blade, spun around, and pulled out a second thin sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first sword fell to the ground and broke with a sound like glass shattering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was wondering ...... where you keep it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a maid's taste. Please don't mind me. However, I only have this one bottle left. Let's finish it this time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A burst of sound echoed through the Francilt mansion. Again, Mena's barrage of thrusts, like a shower, struck Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Retreating again, Nozomu continued to deal with Mena's barrage of blows. But Mena, too, had no intention of repeating the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（How about this?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the deliberate rearrangement of the barrage from earlier, it guides Nozomu's retreat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead is a series of flowerbeds in the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Young trees as tall as a person's waist are planted in brick planters as if they were walls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena is trying to catch Nozomu off guard by using obstacles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Two more moves, one more, now!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She waited for Nozomu to make contact with the retreating plan and then unleashed a full-body thrust.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, however, reversed the move, leaning back and leaning his back against the trees in the flowerbed, repelled Mena's thrust.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What the ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena was taken aback by Nozomu's unexpected evasion, but she gave chase.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She jumped over the flower bed and, as if to sink her body into the ground, she aimed a thin sword filled with qi at Nozomu's back and swung it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, however, turns his sword to his back and prevents Mena's cleave to the side. He was able to avoid the crisis as he had done earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does this man have eyes in the back of his head? ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a certain amount of admiration and dismay, Mena landed. In the meantime, Nozomu takes off with flash step and leaves the gap between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of them glared at each other three times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fū ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu exhaled once more and regulated his breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-149"></a>The heat and tingling tension that runs through his entire body. The sensation of his consciousness being sharpened to the limit reminded him of the time he had trained with his master in the spasim forest, and his mouth relaxed involuntarily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Each time, his concentration becomes even more acute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the ear-splitting silence, Nozomu found himself staring at Mena with a sidelong glance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Mena-san that much instantaneous power. The reason is the swing and speed from slow to sudden perhaps ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena is certainly an excellent swordsman, but the secret of her strength is her blinding speed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From a complete standstill, she steps, shifts her center of gravity, and thrusts. Everything is frighteningly fast. The secret is her near-perfect de-powering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for muscles to tense up and exert their power, they must undergo a process of weakness. She is extremely skillful in this process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is also very delicate in the way she moves her qi throughout her body. Like muscle weakness, it relaxes like a cloud, and at the same time it tenses and pops sharply like a spring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Come to think of it, Shisho once told me. I'm a little stiff. ......) Nozomu released his stance and lowered the tip of his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Let's give it a try ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu suddenly relaxed his stance, causing Mena to look at him suspiciously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the meantime, Nozomu was relaxing his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of blood flowing to the tips of his fingers and toes. Naturally, his shoulders drooped and his neck nodded. The sword held in his right hand is now just hooked around his little finger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only that, the qi that had been circulating throughout the body is gradually loosened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The qi, which had been stiffened and hardened, loosened, and the blood flowed through the entire body. Then Nozomu relaxed his legs and feet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feet collapsed and the body fell according to gravity. Then he slammed his falling weight into his heel heel and stepped forward, at the same time tensing his relaxed muscles and qi at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">What resounded was the same burst of sound as when Mena stepped in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was perfectly replicating her flash step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rushes forward as if crawling on the ground, and Mena quickly throws a thrust as if to strike down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, there was a violent metallic sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-150"></a>Continuing on, a shock hit Mena's arm, and her outstretched arm was pushed back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, Nozomu had raised his sword, supported the peak by pressing his left arm and forehead against it, and was catching the edge of Mena's thin sword with the blade muscle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What? ! Are you insane?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the position of the receiving end is just a little bit off, If he were to miss by even a fingernail, he would surely die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who read the trajectory of Mena's thrusts perfectly while charging at high speed, and who also caught it perfectly, gave Mena a shudder. It is not an action that even a master could easily perform, nor would they even think of doing it in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked down at Nozomu and wondered if he was crazy, but he looked up at her with eyes that had no hesitation at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(No, he is acting with the conviction that he can do it!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that Nozomu's blade is dug into the cutting edge of Mena's thin sword, semi-fixing it in place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, Mena's upper body floats, being swept away by the arm that has been pushed back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Oh not, my body is dead!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, with Nozomu and Mena under the suppression of their abilities, the scales should have tipped in favor of Mena in a contest of strength. In reality, however, Mena has been pushed back by Nozomu and is now a lethal man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason for this was their mutual posture and awareness just prior to the clash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu charged as if scooping up from the ground, and Mena released a stabbing thrust in the form of a strike down. At first glance, Mena seemed to have the advantage, but in fact, her center of gravity was higher than Nozomu's, and she was in a more unstable position compared to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Nozomu was able to fully receive Mena's stabbing thrusts with the ground, a foothold that never moves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, Nozomu acted with conviction, and Mena was upset by his unexpected action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The difference in awareness between the two sides was also a major factor in tilting the scales in favor of Nozomu, who was at a great disadvantage due to the suppression of his abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, the reaction force of his own thrust and the force of Nozomu's assault pushed back Mena's arm, which should have been strengthened with qi.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Have you already calculated this far? !)</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Mena realizes this fact, the shudder turns to awe in her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-151"></a>Nozomu howls, convinced that Mena's body is indeed in dead situation. Nozomu twists his sword, breaking the tip of the thin sword, and at the same time, he releases a slash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena, without care, slammed her qi into her legs with all her might and leapt backward. She just barely avoided Nozomu's slash, but her retreat, without thinking about the consequences, exposed a huge gap for Nozomu to exploit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He returns the tip of the blade and sheathes it in the form of a sword. He strikes the blade with his qi, and then applies extreme compression. He cuts at the waist in time with Mena's landing, and draws his sword as if swinging the blade down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu - Phantom blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The extremely thin blade is released and flies toward her landing point at high speed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meena twisted her body in the air and pointed her shattered thin sword at the ground. While floating in the air and in an inverted position, a powerful blade of chi extended from the tip of the thin sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A qi sword thrust into the ground temporarily stops Mena's fall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Nozomu's phantom completely severed Mena's thin sword in mid-stroke.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena, who had lost her grip on Nozomu's phantom in the nick of time, flipped herself up in the air again and landed on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a good fight. I was completely beaten in the end."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena smiled as she placed the thin sword, which had been cut in half, into the scabbard she had pulled out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, on the other hand, did not seem to be bothered by the great feat he had just demonstrated, and he put the sword away with a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nope, Mena-san, you were going easy on me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Nozomu's opinion, Mena was not yet at full strength.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, she had only used qijutsu to strengthen her body, flash step, which produced tremendous acceleration, and "clothe," which cloaks a weapon in qi. It was easy to imagine that she would have a number of other cards in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's outrageous to say that I'm holding back. It is true that there are some techniques that I have not used, but at least I have not cut corners. I have been serious from the beginning."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......You were really aiming at his forehead, weren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I thought I would have lost even if I was serious."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You were serious, weren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I did. I have told you many times, I believed in you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena heads over to Somia, while brushing off Nozomu's glaring gaze with a cold smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-152"></a>"Somiliana-ojo sama, it's over."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fue! Huh, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somia, who had been stunned by the exchange of so many advanced techniques, came to her senses when Mena called out to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How was it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Etto, you see, ......, Mena."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was too awesome to be referenced~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the teary-eyed Somia, Mena lightly agrees, "I'm sure you did," and turns around to face Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you very much, Nozomu-sama. It's been a while since I've had a good workout."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was under the impression that this maid was also very screwed up, as she was able to lightly call it a good workout despite having had so many sword fights.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, since he was able to stand up so well against that swordsman without the fetters of suppression of her abilities, Nozomu was even more astonished than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a dignified voice echoed through the garden of the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somia, I'm home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane-sama, you're back!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who had returned, catches Somia as she jumps to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome back, Irisdina-ojo sama. How was the request from the guild?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was Garm's herd, after all, It was a very large herd."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A herd that large must have been led by strong leader ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words made Nozomu let out an involuntary yelp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Nozomu himself was involved in the request she had undertaken, he was anxious about the outcome of the elimination.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, it was quite something, from the reports of each party, the total number of direwolves led by Garm exceeded a hundred, and there were several other magical stone bearers. If I hadn't teamed up with Shina-kun and the others, we might have been in danger."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widen at the sudden mention of Shina's name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart jumped from surprise, and his whole body involuntarily tightened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His mind recalled the circumstances he had heard about in Torgrain's laboratory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looks at him suspiciously.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-153"></a>"Nozomu, is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing. But I've never heard of or seen such a number of herds. I'm not sure if it's the same thing as ... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, fortunately, no one was hurt."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well ...... thank goodness."</p>
<p class="calibre1">No one is injured. Nozomu relaxes his shoulders at Irisdina's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiled at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Were you worried about me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A , āh....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, thank you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiles like a flower. Nozomu's face turns red at the sight of that innocent and innocent smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, young miss, what happened to Garm, the leader of the herd?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena urges Irisdina to continue the story.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was a formidable foe, but we inflicted a mortal wound on him. Perhaps it would have been impossible for them to survive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If that is the case, it means that the area around Arcazam is safe. I am glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she brushes off the stereotypical Mena compliments, Irisdina spots the maid, her father's confidant. Its gaze seemed to be somewhat reproachful of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"More to the point, Mena, it looks like you had a good time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, for the first time in a long time, I had a good match. By the way, were you watching us?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, from the very beginning of your matchmaking. You show a great deal of hospitality to the benefactor of the Francylt family, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is a formal request I made to Nozomu-sama, so ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, I thought your request was to escort Somia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's just a pretext."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not sure what you mean by that. A pretext?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I said it all in terms you could know ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pretext? Was I a pretext?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu looked up to the heavens as the maid assured him that Somia's escort was just a pretext.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, too, was holding her temples with her fingers as if trying to stave off a headache.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-154"></a>"I'm sorry, Nozomu. My people caused you trouble. I'm sure you had a hard time dealing with Mena, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A , ā un. It's okay. I'm used to being unreasonable ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He smiles lightly and waves to Irisdina, who bows her head in a truly apologetic manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From Nozomu's point of view, Mena's behavior is somewhat amusing, but it is still better than Shino's punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is thrown out into the spasim forest at night, or made to fainter in agony by an unvisible exquisite technique .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">The punishment he once received from his master comes back to life in his mind, and a dry laugh escapes from Nozomu's mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Nozomu-sama, would you like to join me in pairing up with me on a regular basis from now on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That answer. That's very disappointing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether or not she wanted to do it herself was another story, just because she was used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Mena was seriously disappointed and disheartened, and Irisdina finally couldn't take the headache any longer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena, you're done here, go back to the mansion. I will take care of him."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean? Up to now, this was a legitimate request .....I will now thank you as the benefactor of the young ladies ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I~want~you~to~go~away!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two of them have been in the same room together for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's loud voice, which made no mention of her presence or absence, made Mena reluctantly return to the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm really sorry. As you can see, Mena has a tendency to make fun of whoever she likes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I guess so. I'd say she's quite ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu almost chocked the word "strange maid".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, turned her head down with a truly apologetic expression, so much so that Nozomu, who was watching her, was more worried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's true I don't mind. I just missed it a little and had a good time ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that the training with your master that you mentioned before ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu nodded his head slightly at Irisdina's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-155"></a>Certainly, Nozomu had fallen into the art of swordsmanship as a form of escape. But the environment in which he was able to put his true heart and soul into it was definitely a relief to Nozomu, who was on the verge of breaking down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He and Mena had only spent a short time together, but the time they spent dodging the fierce sword fights reminded Nozomu of the comfort he had felt during those times. It was a tough training, but not all of it was painful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is only after the loss of his teacher and the realization of his own escape that he comes to realize this fact.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, however, this fact reminds Nozomu of the consequences of turning away from the truth, and he once again feels regret and self-loathing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The anguish that swirls in his head causes the smile on his face to twitch slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, can I have a word with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? What it is?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know it's a little late, but I have something for you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina then pulled out a strangely shaped silver coat of arms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was carved with a gold border and a design reminiscent of a shield and an elaborate falcon with outstretched wings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hawk had a sword in its beak and was holding an apple and wheat in its paws, clearly indicating that it was something special.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is the coat of arms of my family. It doesn't mean much in Arcazam, but it will ensure that in the Forsina Kingdom you will not be treated with impunity as a person related to my family."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A nobleman's own possessions. It is a very significant thing for a nobleman to hand over his possessions, even his coat of arms. It means that the Francilt family recognized Nozomu as an important person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widen and a look of bewilderment comes over his face at the sudden mention of the coat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want to thank you for what you did. Please accept it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that ... is it okay? I'm a commoner?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobles and commoners. The differences in their positions vary from country to country, but at the very least, if a commoner lives a normal life, he or she should not be related to or approached by anyone. In some countries, there is even a disrespectful strike.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Irisdina. A commoner and a very high-ranking noble. The reason they are able to talk like this is because they live in Arcazam, a very special city in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-156"></a>"But we owe it to you. And you don't have to worry about your status. Even in our country, there are women who have gone from commoners to heiresses of great families."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's hometown. The Forsina Kingdom is relatively tolerant of the status society of nobles and commoners.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Besides, you are much better than the average aristocrat when you enter the Solminati Academy and advance to the third grade."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This implication is based on the fact that she have come in contact with many nobles, exchanged words with them, and seen them in action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Solminati Academy is the highest academic institution on the Arkmill continent. In order to open its doors to many children, the difficulty level of admission is kept to a certain extent, but there are very strict quotas for advancement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there are educational institutions in the Forsina Kingdom as well, but basically, schools in the royal capital refer to the noble schools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And because it is called an aristocratic school, it is easy to enter and advance to a certain degree if one is of high status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the quality of the students will be superior to the students of the Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that so ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, it's not just about power. You fought for us when the vampires attacked us that time, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think that's the case."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You didn't have to fight at that time. No normal human being would put himself in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if they had a secret power."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was taken aback by the strong tone of Irisdina's voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You were lost. I don't know why you were lost, but perhaps the release of ability suppression puts more strain on your body than you thought. If used incorrectly, it could be enough to kill you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Why do you think that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You fought Lugato for only a few minutes after releasing the suppression of your abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You were asleep for a while after that, It's crazy to think you could do that much strengthening without any strain."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, it is said that in everyday life, people do not exercise all their faculties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a safety mechanism that organisms have. An unconscious limiter. It is said that we are born with what is called an "unconscious limiter," which prevents us from exerting excessive power and hurting ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-157"></a>(If you could take that off at will, combined with your normally suppressed powers, it would be staggering.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can say, moreover, that from what I saw in the fight with Mena earlier, your resolve or sensitivity in the battle is extraordinary. Your ability to see between life and death is extraordinary. I would even say that you are outstanding."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what makes Irisdina shudder even more is the fighting sensibility that Nozomu possesses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Mena is her sword master, Irisdina knows firsthand how sharp her sword is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If seriously reinforced, it would easily pierce even a large rock. In the face of this, Nozomu chose to move forward without hesitation, and instead of deflecting the edge of the sword with the blade, he met it head on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And his boldness suggests to Irisdina the dangers posed by the "release of ability suppression," which is Nozomu's secret technique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps with the release of ability suppression, you are also removing the unconscious safety mechanisms of the living being?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know ....... I've only done it a few times myself."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,....... But it's such a profound move that you'd be lost. I understand that it is a trump card that even the best of us can't easily control."</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why Irisdina can trust him. He really put his life on the line and fought for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You risked your life for Somia with such a dangerous backhand. So you can be confident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You are more than you think you are."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her straightforward words make Nozomu involuntarily look away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The heat and sweet pain seeping from deep within his chest. His eyelids naturally become hot, and tears well up in his eyes. It was the same joyful heat as when Shino once said,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome home".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sniffles at the heat that threatens to overflow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry. I couldn't help it ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was at a loss for words when she caught a glimpse of the loneliness that Nozomu had been carrying around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there was one more thing she needed to tell him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And there was one other thing I wanted to talk to you as well. About Lisa-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened at the sudden mention of Lisa's name. The heat of joy he had felt earlier was suddenly replaced by a feeling of suffocation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina felt as if her hair was being pulled back as Nozomu's expression suddenly began to harden, but she continued to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-158"></a>Irisdina continued, feeling a tugging sensation in her back as she spoke. I have talked to you a little bit about what happened between us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Actually, we talked a little bit. What was going on with you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A story that was immediately rejected when she brought it up before. It is Nozomu's most tender and bare scar. Naturally, Irisdina understands that it is not a scar that should be touched without care.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I thought I should tell him about it. It would be better for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In conclusion, she's not lying. Lisa-kun is serious and recognizes that you're betray her."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know, and you're not lying either."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean by ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. But ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looked up at Nozomu with a puzzled expression on her face, looked up at the night sky once, paused for a beat, and then looked back at Nozomu again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there anything I'm missing? What was going on at the time ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What was going on at the time ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was before you said goodbye to Lisa-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's rational words, Nozomu somehow suppresses the heat that wells up in her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A memory that makes me want to turn away. Nozomu looks back on this painful past, and answers in a voice that sounds as if it were squeezed out of him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....You're right, I was seeing Lisa less and less. Because at the time "I was desperate to train anyway. But when you ask me what else there is to do ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, ....... But this discrepancy suggests one thing. It means that some malice was at work."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What on earth kind of malice could ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Candidates are limited. Nozomu was speechless at the words spoken outside of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, something in the back of his chest began to stir. His pupils dilated and his breathing became erratic. His forehead was covered in greasy sweat, his vision was shaky, and he involuntarily took a step backward, feeling faint and dizzy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a darkness that was deeper than anything he had ever seen in his life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know it's probably tactless to say this, but I felt I had to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence fell between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But please remember this."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-159"></a>"You are an invaluable benefactor to me. No matter what anyone says, I believe in you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's all. Good night then. See you tomorrow ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After seeing Irisdina's back as she ended the conversation with these words, Nozomu also headed home. His steps were heavy, as if he were dragging a lump of iron.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I couldn't say it ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After returning to the mansion, Iris Dina stayed in her room and looked out the window.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The main gate that Nozomu left is reflected in the eyes. The gaze that follows the lingering residue of his back as he walks away is tinged with loneliness and hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know you are worried."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina sighs at Mena, who appears like a shadow, as if she is still a goddess.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why don't you have some tea and calm down?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina is led into the salon by her childhood caretaker and sword master.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting in a soft chair, sipping tea brewed by Mena, she exhaled in distress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He is a good man. He is clumsy and still has his doubts, but I am sure he will realize what he needs to do."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's a very high praise coming from you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, he and I are both a swordsman. If we cross blades, we can understand each other very well."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the tea being poured into the cups again echoes quietly in the salon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina was somewhat unamused by the clear profile of Mena.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... That's not all, is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I did a lot of research before I came to this mansion. Thank God there were more cooperative people than I expected."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying so, Mena takes out a sheaf of papers from her pocket. Irisdina, whom she has known for many years, can't help but wonder where she kept it, but she will probably just be brushed off if you ask her about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina waved her hand to encourage her to talk, and took a sip of freshly brewed tea.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-160"></a>"He don't seem to be highly regarded at the school, but from my investigation, it seems that his homeroom teacher up until last year was a very selective one. No wonder he is not growing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena looked somewhat coldly at the data of Caskell, who had been Nozomu's homeroom teacher until last year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The teacher Caskell is a nobleman from Cremazone empire. Compared to our country, the aristocrats there have a strong sense of electorate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cremazone Empire was founded by a dragon slayer, and its royal family is descended from the last descendants of dragon slayers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because of this, there was a strong tendency to look down on those below the commoners, while at the same time honoring the noble blood ties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most obvious example of this is the slave trade. In some areas, not only the subalterns, who are easily subject to discrimination, but also their own citizens are sometimes considered slaves, and the empire itself is even actively engaged in this practice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But the current homeroom teacher seems to be quite flexible in her thinking. His experience is not quite there yet, but ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning the sheaf of papers in her hand to her pocket, Mena once again reflects on the image of Nozomu Bountis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He has the air of an ordinary young man who is somewhat timid, but from the moment he draws his sword, he also begins to radiate a swordsmanship that sends shivers down her spine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, the brilliance of his technique is truly exquisite. Even in the eyes of Mena, one of the leading swordsmen in the Kingdom of Forsina, it has reached an unparalleled level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a distorted body, a distorted technique, and a distorted mind. In a way, it seems he was broken, but something must have happened to him."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've heard that his master was a big part of his life."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Master ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is something bothering you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, Nozomu-sama swordsmanship, I believe it is Mikagura-ryu."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mikagura-ryu. ......, from the Far East, I believe."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, it's the main school of swordsmanship in the Far East. I believe it is a branch of the Mikagura Ryu, the great master of swordsmanship in the Far East."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amano Sumeragi is an island nation in the Far East. Its diplomatic relations are restricted by fierce ocean currents, and it has almost no contact with the continent of Arkmill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, its national power is so great that it cannot be ignored. When a major power in the eastern part of the continent invaded the country in the past, it single-handedly repulsed an army of several hundred thousand soldiers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-161"></a>It also has its own qijutsu and magic power, and it is said that if it could obtain the cooperation of other countries, research in various fields would advance for several decades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And a few decades ago, before I was born, one of the daughters of the family had left the country."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena is a person who has served the Francilt family for many years. Therefore, she has knowledge not only about the continent, but also about Ameno Sumeragi.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Her name is Shino Mikagura. A great swordsman, one of the strongest of all time in the Far East."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You think that, she is his master?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think there is a possibility. A qi-blade that can easily cut through steel and excellent body control are the characteristics of the Mikagura style. And then there is Nozomu-sama's weapon. That is probably the Mumei/No name."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mumei?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. It is a very special sword made by a certain smith in the Far East. It is said to be a sword like a living being, which can take on various qualities depending on the user."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you think Nozomu's sword also has some special power?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, nothing in particular when we cross swords. Is he in an unawakened state or is he .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ojo-sama, how was he when the ability suppression was released?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't ...... know. It was just overwhelming."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, overwhelming. That is the only way she can be described.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast amount of chi overflowing from him. The torrent of power that could not possibly be contained in a human body was so great that it seemed as if he himself might explode from the inside out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">( Release of ability suppression. That doesn't seem to be the only reason ......) Suddenly, she turn my eyes to the side and see Arcazam in the dark night. The direction in which she looked. Houses lined up in a row. Beyond them is the boys' dormitory where Nozomu lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance between the two, so far away that you can't see it, and the darkness and obstacles seem to remind you of the gap between you and him, and naturally Irisdina's expression becomes cloudy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is the first time, isn't it? 'I've never seen the young lady make such a face."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that so? I have my moments of distress."</p>
<p class="calibre1">To Mena's assurance, Irisdina sips from her cup again without saying a word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To tell the truth, Irisdina herself is not sure of her feelings toward Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is certain that she feels indebted to him, and there is no doubt that she has a favorable impression of him. However, behind this feeling, there is a sense of frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-162"></a>'No, tt is the first time for young lady to be so distressed about the opposite sex."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Irisdina is fretting in agony, Mena is looking down at her with a smile on her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even when you refused to marry your fiancée, with whom you had the most contact, you did not look at him in that way."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a long time ago, but Irisdina had a fiancée.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A long time ago, Irisdina had a fiancée.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She remembers that they were very close, even though they were very young.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, that engagement was broken off when Irisdina decided to become the next head of the Francilt family. Their engagement was based on the premise that Irisdina would marry into the family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is true that there was no match, is it not?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. That gentleman did not approve of the way the young lady is now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her fiancé said to Irisdina, "It is impossible for a woman to be the head of a great house".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Forsina Kingdom did not deny that a woman could be the head of a family. However, it was still a male-dominated aristocratic society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Few women were active among men, and most of their children married into other families.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of them even blatantly despise women who are active in the society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, in particular, is the next head of a very prestigious noble family in the Kingdom of Forsina. Although she put up a good-sounding voice at the top, there were more people who looked at her with disdain from the back of the crowd than any other child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among them were former fiancées who had somehow mingled with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why Irisdina came to Arcazam. With the meritocratic of Solminati Academy, she can put herself in an environment where she can objectively demonstrate her strength. And the road ahead is also .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina is somewhat sorrowful. On the other hand, the smile on Mena's mouth deepens even more at the sight of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But if it's here, it's .......  here in Arcazam, you don't need to worry about it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Mena was looking warmly at Irisdina, who was in a state of distress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because she knew Irisdina in her native country, there is a color in her eyes that rejoices at the change in her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a very good thing. It may be painful, but those thoughts should be cherished."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not what Mena thinks it is, you know. Besides, he has ...... no, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who was unusually stumped, let Mena continue speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-163"></a>"Young lady, an aristocrat is not just an aristocrat because he or she is an aristocrat. Those who understand and accept their position, and continue to improve themselves to be so, are the ones who should be called nobles. There is no higher or lower birthright."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you trying to say?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You already know, young lady. You already know where your best friend came from and what his position is now, as you yourself have told Nozomu-sama, haven't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina stands up in front of Mena, who smiles back at her while tilting her head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to bed."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. Good night."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With Mena bowing reverently with a meaningful smile on her face, Irisdina returned to her room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tingle in her chest had calmed, if only slightly.</p>
