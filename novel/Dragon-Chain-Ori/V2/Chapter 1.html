<h3>Chapter 1: Changes in Everyday Life</h3>

<p class="calibre1">It was truly a nightmarish scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Screams and shouts echoed, and blood and flames danced in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reddish-black wind swallowed the forests of my hometown like a billowing curtain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">My father, normally a quiet man, shouts an uncharacteristically angry voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry, you will survive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">My mother said in a trembling voice, stifling her fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon after, the two were brutally murdered. The black demon beast with countless red eyes killed them both.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My sister took me by the hand and I fled, leaving behind the screams of my father and mother.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I ran, out of breath, my legs almost becoming sticks. But the gaze of the fresh blood that loomed behind me was unbroken.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have to run away from here alone"</p>
<p class="calibre1">My sister, the last one left, lets go of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I look down at her with sad eyes as she shakes her head in disgust, waving her hand and reciting a prayer of congratulation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone…-, Razward, take care of my sister"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A particle of light gathers as if prompted by my sister's words. In the center of the light, a small bird with bright-colored wings appears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are my closest friends and half-bodies. The shining light is the power of the spirits who embody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The stronger the light, the farther away the sign of my sister. And behind my sister, a red-eyed jet-black demon beast was approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The jet-black demon beast twisted his mouth and makes a savage smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nee-san!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, my sister's body was dyed in fresh blood and I was thrown out into the pitch blackness with a flash of light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All that was left was me and the half-body lapis lazuli bird.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Razz......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Giiiiiiiii!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a clink, the lapis lazuli bird shatters, like glass shattering. I desperately try to collect the fragments of my fading best friend, but the fluttering shards are swallowed by the darkness and disappear in a flash.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-21"></a>"Aaahhhh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I screamed in my dream. And in the scream my consciousness was stretched and became distant as if falling into a hole.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah! Haa, haa, haa......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reflexively,  I jerked myself up. The sweat that oozes out makes the underwear stick and is exposed to the cold air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was still dark outside, and the room was shrouded in gloom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I shiver as my body grows cold, and I look down at my hands as I exhale roughly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Again, the dream of that time..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hometown that was taken from me and the people I cared about. The filthy, vile beast that took it away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I clutched my knees and clenched my back teeth at the nightmares I saw over and over again, every day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I endure the pain of the scar that is etched deep in my chest, a scar that will never go away.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Classes held at Solminati Academy. Their content is diverse Languages, magic, mathematics, history, sociology, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Among them, lectures tend to focus on the records at the time of the Great Invasion and the impact it had on various fields.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Therefore~, based on the lessons learned from the battles in various areas since the fall of the Nebula Forest, the importance of effective firepower projection by those who can use magic has  increased,  and  Arcazam  is  collecting  the  secrets  passed  down  from  various  countries, standardizing and optimizing them, and spreading them to the world~~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The class proceeded in a spontaneous tone. While listening to his homeroom teacher, Anri Var, Nozomu Bountis, a student in the tenth grade of the third class, recalled an event that took place about a week ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A friend's birthday party at the Francilt mansion, and the intruder who interrupted the party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His friends were confronted with an absurd past contract and their attempts to resist it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to save his friends, Nozomu also went into battle, and literally did everything in his power to fight off the intruder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the uproar that  ensued, the story of this incident  was  not  a particularly  big  topic of conversation at Arcazam or at the Soluminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Although  there  was  a  barrier,  the  Francilt  family  and  the  school  may  have  managed  to  do something about it)</p>
<p class="calibre1">He has a lot of things to think about, and he is worried, but Nozomu, who is just a student, can't do anything about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-22"></a>"Also~, the land that fell under the power of the demons during the great invasion have been liberated in the subsequent counter-invasion operations~, but there are still areas that have not been  recaptured,  and  there  are  still  frictions  with  refugees  who  have  yet  to  return  to  their homes......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While thinking about that problem, the school bell rings..</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well~, that's it for the morning classes~. Don't be late for the afternoon classes~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the morning class, Anri folded up the textbook in his hand, waved cheerfully, and walked out of the classroom. A relaxed atmosphere filled the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also hurriedly put away his pens and pencils and left his seat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Nozomu, what about lunch?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was approached by Mars Dickens, a student in the same class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With his short blonde hair and his well-built physique, he is seen as a problem child at this school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But for Nozomu, who is also treated as an outcast, he is one of the few friends she has.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was the same person who was present at the incident at the Francilt residence as Nozomu was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"For the time being, I'll buy some suitable bread. What about Mars?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in answer to Nozomu's question, Mars held up a large package in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's quite a big lunch box, but wait a minute, I have to buy my lunch first......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No need for that. I have one for you too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it okay for me ...?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have extra food from the restaurant. If you want, come help me out sometime"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars's house ran an inn and bar in the commercial district of Arcazam Nozomu has visited several times and he is acquainted with Mars's family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. But I can only help with washing the dishes"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu agreed, Mars' chin dropped as if to say, "Let's go".</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a buzzing voice echoed from the corridor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? What's going on, it's noisy"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what's happen…"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When  Nozom  and  Mars's  eyes  were  turned  to  the  hallway,  the  door  of  the  classroom  was opened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello' Nozomu-kun and Mars were there, just in time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good... afternoon"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two girls who entered the classroom were two beautiful looking girls who were stunning to anyone who saw them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-23"></a>One was the black-haired princess, Irisdina Francilt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is carrying a delicately crafted mithril sword at her waist and is walking toward Nozomu and the others, her eyes filled with the light of her strong will and her long black hair reaching down to her waist fluttering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other is Tima Lime, a four-scale magician.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had soft moe yellow hair,  she followed behind the dark-haired girl ahead of her, shrinking back somewhat reservedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them belonged to the highest rank of the third grade, and were very famous people in the school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They had also fought together with Nozomu and the others in an incident about a week ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The students in the classroom, however, were unaware of these circumstances and began to murmur at the sudden visit of the celebrities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Irisdina-san and Tima-san....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You need something?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, nothing much. I just wanted to invite you to lunch"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha~, what---?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a word of Irisdina, the classroom exploded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The students were all longing for an invitation from the school's most admired person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since  they  were  the  ones  who  had  invited  them,  voices  of  astonishment,  doubt,  and bewilderment began to be heard everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the other party is Nozomu, who is the lowest inferior student in the school and is treated as a dropout, and Mars, who is a super problem child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In particular, the line of sight toward Nozomu, the boys, was terrifying, as if they have found their parent's avenger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U, Ue ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu shook himself in spite of the murderous intent directed from all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was  used to  scorn, ridicule, and indifferent  stares because he was  despised as  the lowest rank  in  this  school,  but  even  so,  the  pressure  is  enough  to  send  cold  sweat  down  his  spine unintentionally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Maybe...... Did you have a other to do?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, I don't. I don't have one, so let's get going!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">If he refused, he would continue to be subjected to stares that would make even this needle hell seem like a massage. With that thought, Nozomu took Irisdina's hand and hurried her out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha-What the meaning of this?!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah what?, I was seeing hallucinations!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-24"></a>"Kill, kill, kill ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Nozomu and the others left the classroom, the clamor exploded once again in the tenth-grade classroom. The clamor without stoppers continued to echo with shouts and screams until a teacher who heard the commotion take care of it.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After leaving the classroom, Nozomu and his friends left the school building and headed for the central park, as them being invited by Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They all settled down in the shade of a tree in the woods, somewhat far from the park square.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu remembered the hustle and bustle in the classroom earlier and dreaded returning to the classroom for afternoon classes, but he forced himself to cut it off, saying there was nothing he could do about it now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, I didn't mean to make a ruckuss"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, it's not Irisdina-san fault"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, don't worry about it. They don't care about making noise"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars is a man with a strong wolf-like temperament.He is a man with a bad mouth and doesn't care what others think of him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, his words, which contained a hint of bias, created a delicate atmosphere between Nozomu and Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way How is Somia-chan doing since that incident?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah! That's Somia ... see"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu~san! Everyone!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">From where Irisdina pointed, a girl full of energy ran up to her with a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Somiliana Francilt. She is the younger sister of Irisdina and the girl who had been the price of the Francilt family's contract in the past due to the previous incident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she stopped in front of Nozomu and the others, her face broke into a happy smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehehehehe......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hi, Somia-chan. I'm glad to see you're doing so well"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With Somia joining them, each began to have lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  and  Somia  have  beautiful  sandwiches  with  white  bread,  ham,  and  fresh  vegetables.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Mars had large pies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima, surprisingly, had only two simple breads with vegetables and sliced intestines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... You, that's all you got?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-25"></a>"I'll be full in no time. Mars, yours is very much"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just leftovers"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars bites into the pie when he says so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence passes between the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been watching the scene with a sideways glance, followed his lead and put the pie in his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As he bites into the pie, the slightly fluffy pastry crust tears open and the filling rolls into his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pie was cold and the vegetables and meat inside were not quite right, but he could taste the rich sauce spreading in his mouth. To put it bluntly, it tasted very good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mars, what's inside this pie?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, it's just leftover meat and vegetables from yesterday"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's delicious. As expected from Hannah-san"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, remembering Mars' mother, who was well-dressed and plump, while ate the pie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way, what do you guys do after school?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the meal, Irisdina asked for their after-school schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehm? For now, I guess I'm going to train with Mars?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Nozomu's words, Mars, who was standing next to him, nodded his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These two have been working together more and more often lately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They would often train together. This was a blessing for Nozomu, who had no one to train with now, that Shino, his master in swordsmanship, she had passed away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd like to ask you to come with me for a minute, if you don't mind. I have a favor to ask"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Us?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I want you to take on a request at the Adventurers Guild with me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words made Nozomu and Mars look at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Adventurers' Guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Adventurers'  Guild  is  a  supranational  organization  that  engages  in  a  wide  range  of activities, from chores such as cleaning sewage in the city to defeating beasts and exploring unexplored areas where humans have never set foot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the students work for the guild and earn daily wages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Adventurers' Guild also has a deep affiliation with the Soluminati Academy, and the results of the Adventurers' Guild are taken into account in their grades at the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reverse is also true, the Adventurers' Guild is provided with the grades of the students of the Soluminati Academy, which are used as a reference for rank and when making requests.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-26"></a>The Adventurers' Guild was the first to introduce the rank system, which was then adopted by other countries and gradually became standardized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A request at the Adventurers Guild, is it? Uh, let's see......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's request made Nozomu hesitate and pause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Nozomu has rarely shown up at the Adventurers' Guild since a certain point in his life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was partly because he had thrown himself into the training of Shino, which was so easy to describe as very intense, and partly because the Adventurers' Guild is attended by numerous students from the academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he had not shown up at all in over a year, as well as the contempt and indifference with which he was treated by the students in the guild, also made Nozomu hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't wanna?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina looks up and into Nozomu's face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring into the crisp, jet-black eyes, Nozomu felt as if his consciousness was being sucked into them. His heart began to race and heat began to build up in his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">From embarrassment, he diverts his gaze and utters a word of approval.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing him, Iris Dina smiled with a deep and meaningful smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"All right! Well then, we'll meet in front of the guild"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu understood that she was on board when she suddenly took herself off and said so in a clear manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ai ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ane-sama has a bad taste"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina scratched her cheeks in embarrassment as Somia and Tima stared at her with glazed eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  Mars  was  sighing  when  he  saw  Nozomu,  who  had  easily  fallen  for  Irisdina's colorful tricks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you going to do with it..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the bell rings to signal the end of lunch break.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  and  the  others  hurriedly  cleaned  up  their  lunch  and  returned  to  their  respective classrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, because of Irisdina's invitation, Nozomu was subjected to the murderous stares of the boys during the afternoon classes, which is a digression.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Adventurers' Guild, Arcazam Branch.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-27"></a>Located  in  the  commercial  district  in  the  southern  part  of  Arcazam,  it  is  one  of  the  largest buildings in the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside the building with five floors above ground and three below, there are departments such as a reception desk, a demolition office, and an appraisal room, where many employees  are working.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, students usually only use the reception desk. Hence, the hall on the first floor where the reception desk is located is packed with many students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Irisdina's invitation, Nozomu visited the Adventurers' Guild with Mars, but the bustle of the guild, which he had not seen in a long time, made him somewhat nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, there's someone unusual here"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why is that guy here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. Well, he's not going to get any good requests anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's probably here going to be piggybacked by some party, isn't he? He is just a parasite"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the students who frequent the Adventurers' Guild naturally know about Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they see Nozomu, they give him a skeptical look and then walk away, ignoring him as if they had seen nothing at all. Some of them showed a clearly foolish attitude when they looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu frowned at their attitude, cause it was inevitable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're noisy......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">They too, when glared at by Mars, who was standing next to them, quickly left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oi, why are you letting it go just like that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not like you can just punch them in the face here......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sighs at Mars, who tells him to shut up them out with power. In both words and deeds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how ridiculous you are, if you hit them from here, it's clear that you are the one will be criticized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, this time they are planning to party with Irisdina and her friends. If they cause a commotion, it will inevitably cause trouble for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even Nozomu could not help but feel a stagnation building up deep in his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Before, I didn't feel anything at all)</p>
<p class="calibre1">A pain that used to be harder to feel because I had unconsciously looked away and closed my mind.  Since  becoming  aware  of  his  escape,  Nozomu  has  become  more  clearly  and  more sensitive to the voices around him than before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is proof that his eyes have gradually begun to focus on his surroundings, and at the same time, it is proof that he has begun to face the pain that he had been looking away from.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But while he is aware that this pain is due to his own change, he is not at peace enough to look at everything in a positive light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello, I'm sorry to keep you waiting"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-28"></a>Just as Nozomu was becoming aware of his anguish, a cool voice called out to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, the anguish that had been swirling in the deep of his chest disappeared like an ebb tide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Irisdina who entered the guild hall and approached Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to her, Tima is also present.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes of the surrounding students turned to Irisdina and the others, and then to Nozomu and the  others  whom  she  had  approached.  The  stares  are  exactly  the  same  as  those  that  were directed  at  them  in  the  classroom  at  lunchtime  today.  It  was  a  mixture  of  suspicion,  upset, jealousy, and murderous intent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, not really"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what's this request you want me to take on with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll tell you at the reception desk. Let's go, then"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um,...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Nozomu,  who  is  receiving  the  most  murderous  stares,  is  in  turmoil,  Irisdina  and  the others head for the reception desk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu followed, but at that moment he collided with a shadow that jumped out from the side of the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kya!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  quickly  grabbed the hand of the shadow as  it was  about  to  fall. The soft skin  of  a woman and the slender arms that looked as if they might break returned to the palm of his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry. Are you okay... uhm?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A blue curtain spread out before Nozomu's eyes. The girl on the other side of the curtains made Nozomu's eyes widen involuntarily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  long,  azure,  unkempt  hair.  Eyes  dyed  the  same  color  as  her  hair.  Her  face  was surprisingly white and well-shaped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most distinctive of all were the long, pointy ears that peeked out from her azure hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... An elf?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elves. The intelligent races living on the continent of Arkmill are broadly divided into two categories: human and subhuman, and within the subhuman race there are a wide variety of species.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among them, elves were special and mysterious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are the only race that can make a direct contract with spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, they do not come out into the open and live quietly in the depths of the forest, but they too lost their forest home during the great invasion 20 years ago and were scattered all over the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-29"></a>Anyone can tell that she is student of Solminati Academy because she wear the school's uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Nozomu also remembered her name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was the only elf living in Arcazam. She was the only elf living here in Alkazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......, it's okay, let go of me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl's words were inarticulate, and Nozomu let go of her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She took one look at Nozomu with cold, emotionless eyes, turned on her heel, and walked away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I just bumped into someone......"</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3S2LvY3/000002.jpg" alt="000002" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-31"></a>"Oh, Shina Yuriel, Is that her?. Did she have business with the guild, too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina Yuriel. That is the name of the only elf in Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu turns around, she has already disappeared into the crowd and is out of sight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, uhm...... yeah. I'm fine. Let's go"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu got himself together and headed for the receptionist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Adventurers' Guild reception desk has a horizontal counter with several receptionists in constant operation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am Irisdina Francilt, a third grade, and first class. I'm here to take care of a request you've requested"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon arriving at the reception desk, Irisdina removed the nameplate from her chest and handed it to the receptionist, who was dressed in a crisp uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The nameplate is used to identify the student as a student of Solminati Academy as well as a substitute for a student ID card, in other words, a form of identification in the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I have confirmed it. Here is the request form for the designated request. Are the party members with Tima Lime-san as usual?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Two other members will be joining the party. Nozomu-kun and Mars-kun"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by Irisdina, Nozomu and Mars removed their nametags and handed them to the receptionist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment they saw the black nameplate indicating the tenth rank, the receptionist's expression turned dubious for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tenth class, ranks D and B..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not at all uncommon for people of different ranks to form a party, but it is rather rare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, it is more common for people of the same rank to form a party. The reason is that they know each other well and have a good understanding of each other's movements and thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But The receptionist is professional. The receptionist immediately smiled and began the procedure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Yes, I have accepted it. But It's unusual for you to call someone else for an assignment request."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're very reliable people"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reliable......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who received the request form from the receptionist, returned to Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So what's the request?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a search of the area near the road that connects Arcazam to the Vein River. Apparently, recently, demonic beasts have been coming down from deep in the forest"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-32"></a>The Vein River flows from the Spasim Forest to the Kingdom of Forsina, and at the same time, it serves as one of the main transportation routes for sending goods to Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The safety of this roadway connecting the Vein River and Arcazam is something that Arcazam must maintain, and for this reason, request for regular killing of demonic beasts is being carried out!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But the patrols of the road are done by guards and other students"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, but I've heard that a lot of demonic beasts that seem to have magical stones have been seen recently. Aren't you a little concerned?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magical beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the name suggests, they are demonic beasts with a stone called a magic stone inside their bodies, and individuals with this stone have special magical abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The presence of one of these stone-carriers in a herd of magical beasts can dramatically increase the difficulty of a request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sighting of the magical beast is the reason why Irisdina and her team were asked to do this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I understand. But are you sure we are the right people?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Mars reassured Irisdina, she turned her attention back to Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, you are familiar with the Spasim forest, aren't you? I think you're the right man for the job"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heh, really?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I've been influenced by my training with my master....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, if it is along the road, Nozomu's knowledge does not matter much. Because other students have been around many times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To begin with, there are only so few people in this academy I can trust to have my back, and I can trust you guys because of that one incident"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if agreeing with Irisdina's words, Tima also nodded her head repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The four of them had a certain amount of time to discuss the matter on the spot. The four of them finished the meeting to a certain extent and left the adventurers' guild to complete the request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist at the guild saw them off, and looked down at the copy of the request form in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars Dickens and Nozomu Bountis, is it? ....... Let's see what we can find out"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The school's top student chose an unusual student.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist got up from her seat with a mumble and headed for the reference room.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-33"></a>A short distance away from the counter where Nozomu and the others were working as receptionists, Shina Yuriel, an elf girl, was talking with a beast girl and a human boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, what's going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It looks like there was a bit of a commotion....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beastman girl had ears on her head wrapped in body hair the color of a brown tiger cat, and a tail of the same color sprouted from under the skirt of her uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She carried two daggers at her waist and wore only minimal leather gear over her uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her skirt revealed her firm thighs, and she was dressed lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her name is Mimuru Mideem. She is a member of beastmen tribe called the Neko-tails, and she is a student in the second grade of the third school year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other boy of the human tribe wears a blue nameplate on his chest, indicating that he is in the same third grade, second class as Mimuru and the others. He is quite short, only as tall as the chest of the girl next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His body is thin and his large framed glasses emphasize his fragility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy's name is Tom Dale. He was a student of magic and alchemy at the Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was nothing, you two. I just tripped and almost fell"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she said this, Shina was peering at the request form that the girl called Mimuru had received, but in her mind she was thinking back to the boy she had just met.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, do you know of any student in the tenth grade who has...... an Eastern sword?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tenth class? I don't know~. Who?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying that, Mimuru leans on Tom next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The way he clutched at Tom's boyish arms and nuzzled his cheek was clearly too close to call him a friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom smiled shyly at the sight of Mimuru. The two were childhood friends from the Sumahya Union in the southern part of the continent, and at the same time, they were also lovers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think that's Nozomu Bountis, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? Is he famous?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I guess he's famous. In a bad way. You know, I heard that he had a lot of trouble with Lisa Hounds, a first class student in his freshman year......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaah~ah! I remember that time you were talking about how he betrayed his childhood friend who was always there for him, right? You said his grades weren't good to begin with, and he was still at this school?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru nodded her head repeatedly, her ears and tail twitching.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of Nozomu was well-known at the time, and Mimuru seemed to have retained it in a corner of his memory.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-34"></a>She was a well-known rumor about Nozomu at the time, and Mimuru also had a vague memory of his name.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Shina, what's wrong with him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I was just wondering what kind of person that hold my hand when I was about to fall"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heh, it's unusual for Shina to be interested in strangers, but maybe she shouldn't be for now"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not really what Mimuru thinks I am, I was just curious because you were carrying a weapon with an unusual outfit. But you've done the formalities, haven't you? Let's go."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dismissive wave of their hands, Shina and the others also left the Adventurers' Guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimul followed her, pulling on Tom's arm as they ran off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, let's go-------!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Mimuru, slow down, please slow down"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina let out a sigh as Mimuru passed her, dragging Tom along with her, and turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina looked back with a sigh, and saw the crowd that had just bumped into she had been talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what it was, that nagging feeling in my chest......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina Yuriel was dubious about the sensation, which she had not felt since coming to Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But before she could answer, the loud voice of Mimuru, who had run out of the guild earlier, rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing, Shina, come on!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I know!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Called by her friend, the blue-haired girl tossed the question that popped into her head to the corner of her thoughts and followed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their goal was the south gate. The request they received was to patrol the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oddly enough, this was where Nozomu and his friends, who had bumped into her, had headed earlier.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been ten years since the city of Arcazam was built. The road leading to the Vein River has been perfectly maintained, and the regularly lined stone-floored road cut a line through the deep green forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, one step off the road and there is an unexplored forest, and since there are no barriers to separate the human world from the monsters and beasts, there are occasional attacks by them Therefore, the roads are constantly patrolled by Arcazam guards and students commissioned by the Adventurers' Guild, and powerful monsters rarely appear.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-35"></a>This time, Nozomu and his party began their search a little further into the forest than the main road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is this? Is this ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Footprints. And there are quite a few of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hidden by rocks and tree roots, the footprints were hard to see, but they were left in a straight line at the feet of Nozomu, who was crouching down, by a four-legged beast that had run past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were not the footprints of herbivorous beasts such as deer, but of carnivorous beasts such as wolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, how many do you think there are?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They seem to be running in a line, so it's hard to tell exactly, but  I'd say at least twenty or more......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's a lot ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wolves and wild dogs, for example, operate in group, called herds, usually five to nine animals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is rare for a herd to be this large. This is because the number of wolves and wild dogs in a herd is reasonable considering the fierce competition for survival in the forest, such as securing food and fighting territorial disputes with foreign enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In other words, is there a leader who can maintain that many?......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">If so, the possibility that monster has a magic stone increases even more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A large number of herds means that there is such a prominent leader commanding the herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In addition, these footprints, somehow, seem to have some magic ...... residue on them"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, I'm sure of it. I certainly feel it, Tima?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I feel it too. And there are several different magical powers......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and the others frowned at Tima's words.  The possibility that the demonic beast leading this herd is a magical beast has increased even more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Moreover,  if  we  were  to  rely  on  Tima's  senses,  there  could  be  more  than  one  beast  with magical stones"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Nozomu suddenly looked up and turned his gaze in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I hear something......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Nozomu's words, Irisdina and the others looked at each other and listened carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, they hear nothing but the sound of the wind and the rustling of leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nozomu's ears were hearing faintly. The heavy growl of the beast, the terrified shrieks, and the clamor of battle.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-36"></a>"This voice...... is a beast attacking someone!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah? Hey!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and the other were confused, but they followed Nozomu, who started to run.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After running through the forest for a while, the girls could finally hear the roar of the beast echoing from the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was aimed at the merchants who were heading in this direction of the road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahahaha ....... Wait for me, everyone!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hurry up, we're falling behind!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima isn't very good at moving her body. The magic power she possesses is too strong, and strengthening her body is dangerous,....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That... damn"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars hung up his mouth in a troublesome manner and grabbed Tima by the waist with his left hand and placed her on his shoulder as if he were carrying a package. Tima was flustered by Mars' sudden action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was so upset by Mars' sudden action that Tima was thrown into a panic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fue, fue, e ee e e e e"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop and quiet, I have a sword too, so I'm heavy and hard to move!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not heavy! I'm lighter than normal person!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't say you were heavy!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bustle is getting closer. And as Nozomu and the others dashed out onto the road, they saw, as they had expected, a group of people being attacked by a wolf-shaped demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  riding  cart  with  two  horses  pulling  a  cart.  In  the  back  of  the  wagon  were  merchants  and travelers who were riding along with their luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounding them was a wolf-shaped demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that direwolfs?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A direwolf. A C-rank demonic beast, higher than a wild dog.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is larger than an ordinary wolf, and has the muscle strength to bite and crush human bones with ease.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, like ordinary wolves, they attack their prey in herd, making them a dangerous beast to watch out for in this forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are about 20 of them. However, between the carriage and the monsters, three students from the Solminati Academy were standing in the way, blocking the monsters that were about to attack them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-37"></a>One was a beastman girl with brown-tiger patterned cat ears and tail. She is carrying a dagger in each hand, her whole body covered with qi, and she is playing with the attacking direwolves with her nimble movements.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Near  her  stands  a  golem  that  seems  to  have  been  made  of  clay,  which  is  used  to  keep  the direwolves from attacking her from her blind spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see a boy in a Solminati Academy uniform standing by the carriage, his hand outstretched, his magic power rising. Perhaps that boy who is controlling the golem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And a girl with distinctive azure hair was on the back of the wagon, holding a bow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was the elf from Adventurers' Guild before ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrows were fired one after the other from the bow. The arrows flew through the air like the wind, hitting the direwolf's eyes and limbs with precision.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The direwolves that were hit by the arrows screamed and thrashed about, writhing in agony.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the other direwolves in the pack did not flinch, but rather roared as if their will to fight had been aroused.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They don't seem to be backing down when their friends get hurt. This herd is very excited"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey. Hey, get ready for the spell. Separate the carriage from the demon beast. Nozomu and Irisdina, find the leader of this herd, That's probably nearby"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, Eh? e e e ee ee?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars raised his spirits in response to Irisdina's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring the screaming  Tima, Mars simultaneously activated his  qijutsu and flash step. He leaps  out  of the  grassy area where Nozomu  and the others  are  and charges toward the wolf herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"O earth, mother of the earth, abide! Feed my body, Fube! My will be done, ...... Kyaaa!!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The direwolves, overwhelmed by Mars' charge, give way as Tima, who is being carried like a sack, writhes in agony from the vibrations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uwoooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars rushes to the side of the carriage and activates the wind technique and dust-like blade. He held a large sword in one hand and wrapped it with a blade of wind to reap a cleave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind blade gouges through the earth, and a powerful blast of wind and earth smashes into the front of the encircling direwolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While the direwolves are further frightened by the earth and wind that hit them on the nose, Mars throws Tima, which he was carrying, in a messy manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fueee! Come out, Earthen wall!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-38"></a>While the people near the carriage looked up in dismay at the tossed Tima, she activated the magic she had prepared. The ground around the carriage rose up, and a wall of earth appeared to separate the carriage from the magical beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What she invoked was a magic called "earth wall".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the name suggests, this is an elementary magic that manipulates soil with magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, when used by a magician as powerful as Tima, it can instantly create a wall of earth taller than a carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A wall of earth suddenly appears. The direwolves, whose prey they had cornered, were blocked by  the  suddenly  appearing  fortifications,  and  they  began  to  turn  to  the  right  and  left,  as  if bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, are you ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, a girl from the neko-tail Tribe who had been standing in the front line, was surprised to see Mars suddenly jump into the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, a girl from the neko-tail tribe who had been leading the front line, was surprised when Mars suddenly jumped in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh huh, he's terible..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other hand, Tom, who was operating the golem with magic power, was worriedly calling out to Tima, who had been thrown to the ground and was falling on her buttocks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima looks at Mars resentfully with tears in her eyes, but he is oblivious to Tima's gaze, looking up at the magically created earth wall as if searching for a sign of the outside.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um, can I have a word with ......? Uwa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Tom was about to call out to the motionless Mars, the earth wall in front of him burst open with an impact.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other side of the collapsed wall, five direwolves were standing still. From the mouths of the direwolves shimmered a magical light that seemed to be the residue of magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is magical beast. There are five of them......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the characteristics that distinguish demonic beasts with magical beast is that they use magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic used varies  from individual to individual, but is often primitive, such as striking with magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, the magical beasts of this herd gather magic power in their mouths and strike it down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see, that's the leader......"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-39"></a>Mars' eyes turned to the direwolf, which had a remarkably large physique among the magical beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Direwolf has shiny white body hair and large, sharp fangs that can be seen from a distance, clearly distinguishing it as a special individual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woooooooooong!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The white direwolf roared. As if inspired by the roar, all the direwolves under his command, who had been struggling against the earthen wall, rushed toward the hole in the wall at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it would be easier if they came from one place!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars was bracing himself and drew his greatsword. The three animals that had come ahead of him were cut in two with a single sword strike.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, two of them came in after him and tried to slip past him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oops!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a golem!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru and Tom's golem blocked their path.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The golem is a puppet controlled by the core magical tool and the magic power of the magician.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The earth golem, which is one and a half times the size of an adult, opens its arms threateningly, and Mimuru interrupts the direwolf's path.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two were stopped in their tracks by Mimuru's dagger and Mars' greatsword, which was reaped in return.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pack of direwolves that followed was now riddled with arrows fired by Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Too late!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had set multiple arrows on the strings and released them all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrows rushed into the direwolves in a straight line and hit them one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hit rate was 100 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However much the firing line could be concentrated in one place, the rate of fire and accuracy of hits were astonishing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The direwolves stop in their tracks as their companions are quickly finished off, then veer off to the side to make way again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes  of Mars, Sina, and the others narrowed at  this  action. Beyond their  gazes,  intense magical light was gathering in the oral cavity of the leader direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other magical beasts also do the same, gathering magic power into their mouths.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina again turns the arrow and begins to pour magic power into the arrow. The blue-colored magic light pours into the arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>However,  before  the  two  sides  could  unleash  their  attacks,  the  situation  took  another  major turn. Two shadows came out from the flanks of the direwolf leaders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That person is ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes turned to the shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of them is Irisdina Francilt, a well-known talent at the school and a party member with Tima Lime and the other was a classmate who bumped into her at the guild branch.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Mars  and  Tima  were  distracting  the  magical  beasts  while  protecting  the  carriage, Nozomu  and  his  team  made  a  surprise  attack  from  the  flank.  Both  sides  strengthened  their physical abilities with qijutsu and magic, and ran to close the distance at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as they leaped out of the bushes, the wolves with magic stone noticed Nozomu and Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The four wolves, except for the leader, intercepted Nozomu and the others who had attacked them by surprise. The four direwolves were coming toward them, emitting a magical light from their entire bodies. Their speed is clearly faster than that of ordinary four-legged monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"They're fast. Is it strengthened by magical power? I'll take the four, you take care of the leader"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Leave it to me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time Nozomu stepped forward, he put his qi into the sword at his waist and thrust it out as if to raise it with his left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, with his right hand on the hilt, he draws the sheath with his left hand and draws the sword from his waist. The blade is placed along the joint of the jaw of the first beast that jumped at him..</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shingg!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blade  with  an  ultra  compressed  qi-blade  severed  the  jaw  joint,  and  the  direwolf's  jaw dropped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade also stroked the jaw of the other one, which leapt at it with the returning blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Geehuh ...... gahuh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second wolf was also easily knocked off its lower jaw in front of Nozomu's qi-blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain, loss, and blood loss caused the two beast to roll and sprawl on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The means of attack of wolf-shaped magical beasts depends on their strong jaws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, simply depriving them of the means to do so can almost completely deprive them of their fighting ability.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-41"></a>The opponent, however, is a demonic beast with a magic stone that can use magic. Nozomu, without letting his guard down, flashes his sword and cuts off the heads of two wolf that have lost their jaws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Gyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shoo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The third one leaps at him, unafraid, and this time the blade swung at vertical cuts it down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It  is  a  qi-blade  that  cuts  even  the  mad  bear,  which  boasts  a  much  larger  physique  than  the direwolf, in two.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The body of the third magical beast, which had been cut cleanly in two, and separated into left and right weeping, fell to the ground with a thud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Irisdina unleashes the final stuffing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  ability  "Immediate  Deployment"  was  activated.  Without  the  chanting  and  magic  circle originally  required,  she  deploys  magic  based  on  the  formulas  and  images  generated  by  her brilliant mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What was produced was a great jet-black spearhead. The spear, constructed with dense magic, radiated  an  intimidating  presence  that  was  hard  to  believe  it  had  no  weight.  The  limbs  of Irisdina, beautiful as a willow, flexed, and like a castle-breaking bow, she ejected the magic great spear held in her left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huff!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intermediate magic, deep abyssal spear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  great  spear,  which  was  released  as  if  it  were  being  bounced,  lunge  toward  the  leader's magical beast while shaking the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a roar, the leader's magical beast activates the magic it had on standby. The magic power emitted from its mouth collided with the abyssal spear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Deep Abyssal Spear," which was thrusting forward while gouging out a torrent of magical power, and the flow of magical power that was trying to push back were competing with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the conflict was cut apart by a meteor-like light shot from the side of the spear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyaan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go-uh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A single arrow flew into the air, emitting a blue magic light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the one that Shina Yuriel had prepared before Nozomu and the others launched their surprise attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-42"></a>The arrow, flying about as if it had a will of its own, pierced the scattered other direwolves one after another and attacked the leader direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no way for the leader of the direwolves to avoid Irisdina magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blue arrow blows off the head of the leader's direwolf, and the "abyssal spear" blows off the remaining torso, which is no longer able to hold it back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku~uuuu…"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last remaining direwolf with the magic stone, horrified that it friends had been defeated so quickly, turned on it heel and fled into the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina and Nozomu exhale and confirm each other's safety as the threat has passed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you okay, Irisdina-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm fine. Thank you for clearing away the other. It's awesome that you can cut off the jaws of two magical beast so precisely and create that level of qi-blade in an instant"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Nozomu had been treated as a non-entity at the school until recently, he felt his cheeks heat up involuntarily at Irisdina's honest praise and smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's  not  right,  Irisdina-san  is  more  than  me.  your  has  abilities,  you  can  cast  such  magic immediately"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, I've been working out. 'As for me, I'm also curious about the power you showed in the mansion'..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While  Nozomu,  who  didn't  catch  the  latter  part,  looks  doubtful,  Irisdina,  as  if  to  deceive, deepens the smile on her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing. Let's go meet up with Tima and the others"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of them sheathed their weapons and headed for Mars and the others, who were holding the beast back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mars, good work"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima, are you all right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh, my butt hurts......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu raised his hand lightly to confirm that he was safe, and Irisdina moved closer to her best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Mars, who was in a lighter mood, Tima was supporting herself with a cane and rubbing her back like a grandma. It was a sight that ruined the beautiful girl image.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-43"></a>Meanwhile, as Irisdina was checking on Tima, the students who had earlier been guarding the trading party approached her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Irisdina, and to all of you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a small student, Tom Dale, who spoke to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  looked  to  be  in  his  early  teens,  but  the  blue  third-grade,  second-grade  nameplate  on  his uniform made Nozomu and the others realize that he was a classmate of theirs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom wears a cloak so large that it seems to completely envelop his petite body, and at the waist of his uniform he wears a belt with pouches of various sizes attached to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see many pockets on the underside of the cloak, and a wooden doll with woven jewels is hooked to the belt at his waist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I just happened to see you and I'm here to help. You guys are ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Third grade second class, Tom Dale. This one is Mimuru Midir"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice to meet you!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat-tail girl called Mimuru winked and waved to Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her whole body is full of vitality and her demeanor suggests that she has a very easy-going personality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At her waist are two daggers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It looked like a plain steel dagger, but the residue of qi exuding from her body indicated that she was a qi user just like Nozomu and Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then she....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina Yuriel"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last person introduced was the elf girl that Nozomu bumped into at the guild branch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She takes a step back from Tom and Mimuru and says her name in a hushed tone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I know who you are. My name is Irisdina Francilt"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm Tima Lime"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ehm, I know who you are"</p>
<p class="calibre1">First Irisdina and Tima introduce themselves to Shina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina also seemed to know their names, but her tone of voice was as indifferent as cold fresh water.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Nozomu were next, but Mars was looking away with his arms crossed, as if he had no intention of introducing himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu scratches his head in annoyance at his friend's appearance, but has no choice but to introduce himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, my name is Nozomu Bountis. Over there is Mars"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-44"></a>Shina's gaze turns to Nozomu. Shina eyes, which had originally given the impression of being cold, narrowed even further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Skepticism, and a hint of disgust. It's the same look that Nozomu has been given time and time again at the school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu squinted a little at the sudden glance, but felt his mood sinking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heh, so you're the one......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Mimuru, whether she knew it or not, leaned forward and looked into Nozomu's face. Nozomu was taken aback by her sudden action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, etto...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Irisdina-san, why did you get team up with this guy? He's in the tenth grade, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, distracted by Nozomu's confusion, begins to ask Irisdina some awkward questions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, but he's strong. Didn't you see him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it looks like it, but there's a lot more to this guy than that"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know, he betrayed his girlfriend. Red-Haired Princess, as I recall. First Class Lisa Hounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gichiri ....... Nozomu felt something creaking deep in his chest. Then, his heart beat faster, and his hands began to sweat. He found himself biting down hard on his back teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Ah! I shouldn't have said that in front of him! Sorry, sorry!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"... It's not something you say, regardless in front of himself or otherwise Tom admonishes Mimuru for her wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, finally realizing that the atmosphere of the place had deteriorated all at once, bowed her head repeatedly. Apparently, she is quite careless or has a tendency to say what she thinks immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goodness, I'm sorry Nozomu-kun, for Mimuru's rudeness"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......No, I don't mind it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he says he doesn't mind Tom's follow-up, there is a heaviness in Nozomu's tone of voice that he cannot hide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bitterness of remembering casts a shadow over Nozomu's mind like muddy water, as he has only been  able to  forget  his  despised environment for the past two  weeks thanks to  the presence of Irisdina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, speaking of which, that arrow you used earlier to kill the leader of the direwolves, is that some kind of special trick?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-45"></a>For  now,  Nozomu  tries  to  change  the  subject  by  talking  to  the  remaining  Shina.  It  seems pathetic,  but  when  Irisdina  had  asked  him  about  Lisa  before,  he  had  walked  away  without saying whether or not he was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With that in mind, it can be said that he is now able to properly swallow his emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">".... Yeah, Tom's done a little work on the arrow feathers and shaft"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps sensing Nozomu's state of mind, Shina answers the question in a blunt tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was incredibly powerful and inductive"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heh heh, it's called an engraved arrow, and it's Tom's characteristic arrow, it was  amazing, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's upper arm folds around Shina's curt response and expands on the story.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Mimuru is beaming with joy and a big smile on his chest, even though it is not his own, while Tom is chuckling in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I  don't  have  a  big  formula.  I  just  change  the  trajectory  slightly  in  response  to  the  surgeon's magical power, so if you can't read the wind and the opponent's movements accurately, you won't be able to hit them well. Besides, I haven't devised a formula to increase the power of the technique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see...... So you're saying that the power of that arrow is only because of her power"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't it spirit magic? Speaking of elves, spirit magic is one of the best"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars and Irisdina join the conversation, perhaps intrigued by Tom's technique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu gulps at the word "spirit magic" that their utters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit magic. It is the work of spirits, a more fundamental power that is distinct from the magic used by humans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elves, another name for the race most beloved by spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They can borrow the power of spirits with only their own magical power, without the use of ritual tools or complicated ceremonies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And spirit magic was the power that Tiamat, the giant dragon that Nozomu alreadyto take in, also used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......I just didn't need it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Shina is mentioned in reference to spirit magic, she replies nonchalantly with the same cold expression she has always had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, elves do not have much to do with other races and rarely open up to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is largely due to their ability to communicate with spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The environment in which they are surrounded by beings with whom they can communicate without using words from an early age diminishes the need for words.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-46"></a>In  addition,  they  are  a  rare  species  with  few  of  their  own  kind,  which  results  in  small communities and other conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably,  many  elves  become  closed-minded  and  speak  few  words  when  interacting  with other races.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their inarticulate attitude is sometimes taken as arrogance, which often leads to trouble with other races.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina Yuriel is a typical elf in this way, and she never breaks her cold attitude toward Irisdina and the others, not to mention Nozomu and Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I appreciate you lending a hand. Sorry, but I have to report to the guild. I'll see you then......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina  turns  away  and  tries  to  leave.  Not  only  Nozomu,  but  also  Irisdina  was  unable  to  say anything, but someone unexpectedly came to her rescue. It was Mimuru, who had just repeated his gaffe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you going to do now, Ohime-sama?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ohime-sama? You mean me? Well, we report to the guild too......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then let's go together! then, it's okay"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru ignored the delicate atmosphere of the place and suggested to Irisdina to go with him to report to the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fumu, what do you think, Nozomu-kun?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm okay, but ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu glanced at Shina, she frowned for a moment but let out a sigh as if she had no choice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....it's okay"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay! Let's go then!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru  raised  her  hands  in  joy  at  the  words  of  approval,  which  she  uttered  in  a  desperate attempt to push them out of her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf girl's sigh, as if to say, "It really can't be helped," gave Nozomu a glimpse of the power relationship between the two.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  beastman  girl  who  is  being  pushed  around  and  an  elf  girl  who  is  being  pushed  around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sees the relationship between the two as similar to his own relationship with his late master</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I wonder if you're having a hard time...)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What......?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina gives a jittery look at Nozomu, who almost lets out a chuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-47"></a>The air in the place that had been heavy just a few minutes ago had eased somewhat.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After defeating the herd of direwolves, Nozomu and his party returned to Arcazam with Shina's party escorting the carriage, and went straight to the guild to make a report.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After reporting to the guild, the results were assessed and rewards were paid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, in the Adventurers' Guild, the evaluation increases in accordance with the results of contributions,  and  continued  achievement  above  a  certain  level  will  lead  to  promotion  to  a higher rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adventurers are then able to attract more benefits and cooperation, and receive assistance in many ways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Arcazam branch, on the other hand, holds a special position among the many branches of the Adventurers' Guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is organized and managed with a view to cooperating with the Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are few active adventurers in the Arcazam branch. The majority of its requests are carried out by students of the Solminati Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So we found a trading party being attacked by a herd of direwolves, so we worked with the first responders to eliminate the attacking herd"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While listening to Irisdina's report, the receptionist checked the documents in front of her in detail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Under what circumstances did they confirm the traces of the magical beasts, track them down, come in contact with them, fight with them, and eliminate them?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, who was asked the question, answered the receptionist's question without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see. Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, there is no doubt about it. The parts that prove the defeated magical beasts are also here"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina shows the fangs she cut from the direwolf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demonic beasts they defeated, but because of their large number, thry could not put them on the wagons, and most of them, except for the demonic beasts that had magical stones, were left at the site. Therefore, only the largest canine teeth were cut off as proof of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the bodies of the remaining demonic beasts also need to be disposed of as soon as possible, as they may attract other demonic beasts if left unattended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have confirmed it. We will recover the remaining demonic beasts on the streets. The reward for  accomplishing  the  search  request  will  be  ready  soon.  As  for  the  sale  of  the  defeated monsters, please contact ...... after the recovery"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-48"></a>"I understand"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lastly, I would like to confirm that this student, Nozomu Bountis, did indeed defeat the three magical beast?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist's skeptical eyes turned to Nozomu. The other students in the guild overheard the receptionist's words and began to look at Nozomu suspiciously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oy, that bottom-feeder just beat a monster with a magical stone"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, it can't be, it's a mistake, black-haired princess, he's just a parasite"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist in the reference room checking the results of Nozomu Bountis while Irisdina and her team were carrying out the request.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Adventurers' Guild is committed to fair evaluation without regard to race or birth. As such a guild employee, she, too, absolutely does not tolerate any injustice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, as a receptionist, she understood that some people would make false reports.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, she is suspicious of Nozomu, puzzled by the discrepancy between her performance at the school and the report presented in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, there is no doubt about it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">''But this way of defeating ....... I understand. I honestly can't believe it, but I'll admit it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist has a reluctant look on her face, but Irisdina's starchless response makes her to acknowledge the report. She smoothly runs her pen over the request form and stamps it with a seal of accomplishment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The request is now complete. All that remained was to take the request form to the cashier, and she would receive her reward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was still a tinge of skepticism in the receptionist's gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm  sorry,  but  there  are  no  points  awarded  to  Nozomu  Bountis  for  this  request.  You  know why?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The receptionist said in a stern tone of voice to Nozomu as she held out the stamped request form.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, the points for accomplishing a request are distributed fairly according to the rules set by the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  however,  the  Adventurers'  Guild  does  not  allow  low-ranked  members  to parasitize on high-ranked members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For this  reason, there are a number of  factors to consider, such  as rank  disparity  within the party, difficulty of the request, percentage of requests completed, and school performance, with points added or subtracted as necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-49"></a>The reason for these exceptions is to prevent those without ability from moving up to higher ranks and, by extension, to prevent the guild's rank system from losing trust and credibility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in this request, a negative assessment was applied to Nozomu, which cancelled out all of his evaluation points.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a rank disparity with Irisdina and her colleague, but the most important reason is that she has not received any requests from the guild for more than a year and has no achievements or results to compensate for this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the negative assessment due to this gap is only for this one time, and will not be a problem if the guild receives requests on a regular basis in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The guild understands that it would be unprofitable for them to punish adventurers who are negligent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......Yes, I know"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars Dickens, you too. We don't give credit to troublemakers, even if they are competent"</p>
<p class="calibre1">""Shut up, you're wearing too thick. Your makeup is cracking and make little wrinkles"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh, thick ....!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars's bouncing words ran a blood vessel on the receptionist's forehead. In addition, makeup powder fluttered from the distorted cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu hurriedly covered Mars' mouth. She is in her late twenties. As a woman, she is at a complicated age in many ways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But to defeat four demonic beast with magic stones in the same day, as expected from the black-haired princess and the four scales"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  you've  been  with  a  ruthless  kareha  ear,  it  might  be  the  result  of  being  forced  to  do  the opposite"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... kareha ears?" (Elf ears)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilts his head at the unfamiliar words coming from far away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu hear a gasp and look next to him to see Shina with a hard expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thin hand on her arm was squeezed tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the door to the guild hall opens with a bang! and a large group of students enter with a loud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were about 20 people in all. From the looks of it, they were students in the second to fourth grades of the third school year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sight of so many students of other classes walking together attracted the attention of the guild staff and other students.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-50"></a>Walking at the front of the group was a beast man with silver hair and a tail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His  arms,  covered  with  well-trained  muscles,  extend  out  from  the  sleeves  of  his  rolled-up uniform, and his golden eyes are full of self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  the  tips  of  his  silver  body  hair  are  overflowing  with  vitality,  and  he  clearly  wears  a presence that sets him apart from the other students present here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And on his  chest  shone a purple nameplate indicating his  first  class, the highest  rank in  the school year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin Ardinal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is  a male student  belonging to  the first  class  of  the third  year. He is  a rare  race of wolf beastmen called the Silver Wolf Tribe, and one of only five people in the third grade who are recognized as deserving of the A rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"isn't that Irisdina? What, are you here to take a commission?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's already done. Are you guys reporting in now?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oy. Hey, I finished the request. Go through the procedure"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When  he  approached  Irisdina  in  a  friendly  manner,  Kevin  tossed  the  request  form  from  his pocket onto the counter where the receptionist sat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where the report is .....""</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Calanti. Explain it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Understood!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving the reporting to the other students in the party, Kevin turned to Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the  gray, beast-eared  female student entrusted  with  the report  heads  toward the reception desk with a crisp look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what kind of request was it, Irisdina? Was it to take down the designated demonic beast in the Spasim Forest, since you're the one who's in charge?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it was to patrol"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you around the road now? You're too good for that thing"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly disappointed, Kevin cowered his shoulders and, narrowing his wolfish eyes, took one look at Nozomu and the nameplate he was wearing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu Bountis, is that him? .......Oy, Irisdina, you are the head of the third year, aren't you?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then choose the right battlefield and subordinate"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin seemed to know about Nozomu, but he quickly lost interest in him, and then he crowded Irisdina in a rather strong tone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, smiles and brushes off Kevin's complaints.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm asking him to do anything appropriate"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-51"></a>"You..., Are you daydreaming or something?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin puts his hand on his forehead and looks up to the heavens in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing Nozomu's reputation, Kevin's reaction is only natural. Rather, it is better that he does not continue to spew insults down the line.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't realize you had kareha ears with you. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  moment  he  saw  Shina,  who  was  a  short  distance  away  from  Irisdina  and  the others, a look of disdain came into Kevin's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  tilted  his  head  in  disgust,  a  color  that  was  clearly  stronger  than  the  one  he  had  seen  on Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you will see that the beasts in Kevin's party also have a sharp look at Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're just a proud, deep liar, lying elf"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Poisonous insects. They're the ones who did this to me......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's cronies start cursing in a voice that Sheena can clearly hear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is this feeling of indignation? This is not normal)</p>
<p class="calibre1">What in the world could have happened between Shina and them?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  question  mark  in  Nozomu's  head  could  be  answered,  Kevin  had  left  his  cronies alone, pointing at Shina and crowding Irisdina with an even stronger tone.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z82ks10/000006.jpg" alt="000006" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1">"Irisdina. Did you work with this guy too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-53"></a>"We fought together when we fought off the demonic beasts. So you come here to insult our comrades who fought with us, albeit temporarily?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, on the other hand, could not hide her annoyance at Kevin and his cronies who were clearly insulting their comrades in arms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She glares at Kevin and his cronies with a quiet, yet clearly contemptuous voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No ... Just don't work with her. I don't trust elves, and she's not even a good elf to begin with, she’s failure elf"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Failure?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Enough of this. You want to create a ruckus here? If you want me to be a head leader, then you should look at what you are doing and saying"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not  going to deny what  I said or did. But if you insist,  I'm  going home today. See  you later"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With these words, Kevin took the reward from the student who had reported the incident and left with his party members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Kevin and the others disappeared through the hall door, the tense atmosphere in the room finally relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was an indescribable, awkward atmosphere between Nozomu and Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm leaving. See you then......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few seconds of silence, Shina said a few parting words and turned away without making eye contact.</p>
