<h3>Chapter 3: The Fairy Who Lost Her Wings</h3>

<p class="calibre1">After class the day after the request with Irisdina and her friend, Nozomu visited the library.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason was simply to review today's lesson and to prepare for tomorrow's lesson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The library at Solminati Academy is located a short distance from the main school building.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Near  this  library  is  one  of  the  continent's  leading  research  institutions,  the  Groaurum Institution, which also houses their materials.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, while Nozomu has been training with Shino, he has been studying either in his room in the dormitory or in Shino's hut. In terms of ratio, the majority of his time is probably spent in Shino's hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even so, Nozomu still used the library whenever possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to keep up with the classes at the school, there is a limit to what one can do with only one's  earthly  comprehension.  Therefore,  it  was  natural  for  them  to  try  to  make  use  of  the wisdom of their predecessors in the form of books.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Iris, do you have any books on how to operate a magic tool that might be helpful?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I think there was a reference in Klauben's book. It must have been on the shelf over there"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, Irisdina, Tima, and Mars are also at the desk where Nozomu is sitting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These women were also studious students and often used this library.</p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-12">
<p class="calibre1">It was a little surprising to see Mars studying in the library, but it seems that he too had his own thoughts after the battle with Nozomu at the end of the second year and with Rugato.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it seemed that he had begun to actively engage in training and study related to magic as well as qijutsu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  interrelationships  between  the  attributes?  The  influence  of  topography  and  geological conditions on magic? What kind of code is this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mars-kun, that's the stuff you were supposed to have done in second grade, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, from the looks of things, Mars' studies were not going well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars' grades are the opposite of Nozomu's, with a sharp difference between practical skills and classroom studies. While his grades in practical skills are very high, his grades in classroom studies are always just below the edge of flunking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I mean, Mars, you didn't learn much, but you could use magic?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have abilities, so I could manage to use the wind attribute even if it was rather somehow"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somehow ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, Mars is a very rare person who is highly skilled in both qijutsu and magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, when he professed that he was able to use magic somehow, Nozomu, who is unable to use magic, could not help but look at him with a cold stare.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-76"></a>"Hey, just because you can manage use it doesn't mean you don't have to study, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  other  hand,  Tima,  who  is  struggling  with  powerful  magic,  seemed  to  have  some thoughts about Mars' words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know. That's why I'm studying it all over again"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you doing more magic now?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, because of that old vampire thing ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars has only ever used qijutsu when fighting, aside from in class.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is partly because his own temperament was more suited to qijutsu than to magic, but it is more accurate to say that there was no one to corner Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, there is still room for him to grow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only natural that Mars, who was confronted with his own inexperience in the battle with Rugato, would try to learn magic in light of his own qualities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right. If you're not good at studying magic, why don't you ask Tima to teach you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"… Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"…… What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima and Mars were amused by Irisdina's sudden suggestion, which  had been watching next to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima was originally a student of Ekross, so her knowledge of magic is considerable. Isn't she the right person?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? Tima-san from Ecross?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it true?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I came to this town when I was about seven years old because I was discovered to have magical abilities ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seven years old, that's about ten years ago"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten  years  ago.  It  was  right  around  that  time  that  Arcazam  and  the  educational  institutions associated with it were founded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The calculations ticked away in the minds of Nozomu and Mars, leading to a single answer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you a student from Ecross first generations?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, yes ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ecros is a subordinate of the Soluminati Academy, which Somia also attends, but at the same time  it  gathers  children  with  special  talents  from  whole  continent  and  provides  them  with proper education.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, Tima is one of the students who has studied modern magick the longest, not only in this city, but on this continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't she a good fit?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Irisdina proudly points to Tima, the person in question shrinks back like a borrowed cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-77"></a>It is true that, considering Tima's background, there is no one better qualified to teach magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But are you sure?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've never taught anyone before, and I don't know if I'll be able to do it well ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't think so, because I'm sometimes taken care of too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina follows up on Tima's lack of confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that she is able to teach the most talented girl in her grade is enough to confirm that Tima's knowledge is genuine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"…… I'm countin on you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yes!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima accepted Mars' request with a big smile on her face, which was blunt and not the kind of man that someone who would is asking a favor of someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After receiving Tima's approval, Mars flipped through his textbook to see what questions he wanted to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  midst  of  all  this,  Irisdina  watched  them  with  an  amused  expression  on  her  face, approached Tima without being noticed by Mars, and began to whisper something in her ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, Tima's cheeks turned bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, tell me about it right away, first of all, this ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiya! Uh, let's see ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu guessed that Irisdina must have said something strange again, but Mars, who did not see it, just tilted his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, are you okay? You don't have to worry about it if you don't want to"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I don't mind! I don't mind at all!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, um ......, then about this..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima suddenly shouted out loud, and Mars held out a textbook to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tima, you should be quiet in the library~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uee! U~~, U~~, U～～～～"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, the original culprit, Irisdina, with a smile on her mouth, began to tease Tima again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew Tima was cute after all. Now then, I'll get back to my studies"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I'm going to go look for some reference material, but Iris, I think you're going to be in a trouble someday"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, after making fun of her best friend for a long time, returns to her study, and Nozomu leaves her seat, letting out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right, Nozomu, have you thought about yesterday?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......I'm thinking of coming to the Adventurer's Guild again, ..... that's what i planning to ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-78"></a>"I see ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu stood up from his seat, hesitated for a moment before replying to Arisdina's words from  behind  his  back,  and  then  went  straight  to  the  bookshelf  where  the  documents  were placed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina stares at Nozomu's back with a sideways glance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes, without her noticing it, were filled with a quiet warm that she had never have before.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's  see,  the  complete  book  on  magical  tool,  and  then  an  overview  of  Klauben's  military science. Then there's ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, having parted from Irisdina and the others, checks the countless bookshelves lined up, trying to find the book he is looking for.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The library in Arcazam has both open and closed shelves at the same time, and Nozomu is in the open shelves space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The library also houses research materials of the Glorerum institution, which are located in the closed-case shelves space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  enter  the  closed  shelves,  one  must  pass  through  a  special  passageway,  and  of  course, permission is required not only to borrow, but also to enter and leave the library.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having  secured  the  desired  book  for  now,  Nozomu  sits  down  at  an  empty  desk  and  begins reading.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The students around him were sparse, and now that everyone was concentrating on their own assignments, all he could hear was the sound of pages being turned in books and pens running.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence was gratifying to Nozomu, but at the same time a little painful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words, "If you want to go higher," were troubling Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with her words, the words of his master that said he don't need to be any stronger also come back to the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Shisho told me that I could run away. Maybe trying to study in this way is also a postponement of the problem ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">What comes to Nozomu's mind is his childhood friend and his lover who left him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I still don't understand why she suddenly rejected me, even though she had been supporting me ever since I came to this school and my grades had not been good enough.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, however, Nozomu couldn't help but feel a heavy, indescribable feeling of heaviness in the pit of his chest, as if he had hit by a big rock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（I wonder if it's really true. Maybe I haven't realized something important yet ......) Nozomu  himself  did  not  want  to  remember  those  days,  and  since  he  had  been  devoting  his body and mind to training with Shino for so long, he did not think about it much anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-79"></a>It was a form of escapism that he himself had turned away from, and at the same time, now that he was aware of his own escapism, he could no longer turn away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Admittedly, we didn't see each other much anymore after Lisa dumped me ......) At the time the ability suppression manifested, Nozomu increased the amount of training he did anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, from that time on, Nozomu had fewer and fewer opportunities to talk with Lisa.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, no matter how much he thinks back, he cannot understand why she would turn away from him so coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And now that he is aware of his own escape from reality, he is frustrated that he is standing still.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is now aware of his own escapism, but he is unable to answer what he should do about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(This thing, too, is back on again ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking down at his right hand and staring into his eyes, he sees an invisible chain wrapped around his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a proof of ability suppression and at the same time a lifeline that contains the giant dragon he has taken in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been wrecked several times before, but then reappears and continues to bind Nozomu's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Iris and the others don't seem to be asking for more details about this power yet, but ......) Nozomu hesitates, remembering the conversation at yesterday's launch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Should i talk about it? If I don't have to talk about it, what's the point?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anxieties and backward-looking choices well up in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, the desire to talk also rises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conflicting  emotions  are  mixed  up,  swirling  around  and  bringing  a  myriad  of  rationales  to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa, no good ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu,  who  was  severely  distracted,  decided  to  stop  looking  for  books  and  take  a  break, since the desired book was not on the shelves at hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The library expects a large number of students to visit, so it has a place where they can eat and drink.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was about to return when a book caught his eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'A Reflection on Spirit Magic and the Tribes that Favored Them'</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a book about spirits and Fairy tribe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you can see that there are many books about spirits on the shelves there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(This is ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu quickly picked up the book and flipped through its contents.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-80"></a>'Spirits are beings that have come to have wills by gathering together the source elements that flow in the dragon veins of the earth. Therefore, they are able to take in not only the source elements, but also qi and magic power as their own food'</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Spirits can be broadly classified into three categories: the fine spirits, the minor spirits, and the great spirits. Of these, most of the spirits that people have seen are the fine spirits, followed by the minor spirits’</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘The most famous of the great spirits are the spirits of the great trees in the forests of Nebula, and this class of spirits has the power to exert a tremendous influence on a nation’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The book began with basic knowledge about spirits and their relationship with other races.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Sometimes spirits make contracts with carnal beings on a whim. They feed on the qi, magic, and source material of the beings in the flesh and lend their power to the beings with whom they have contracted'</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Among them, the affinity between fairy tribe and spirits, in particular, overwhelms the other races. Contracting with spirits is as normal to them as a bird flying in the sky, and powerful fairy can even contract with fine spirits'</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Conversely, with a few exceptions, the human race has little affinity with spirits. Their low affinity  can  be  said  to  be  less  than  that  of  insects.  No,  it  would  be  disrespectful  to  insects, considering that some insects are possessed by spirits'</p>
<p class="calibre1">What can he say, what a very outspoken author. However, as for Nozomu, the phrase "some exceptions" was very worrisome. He himself is a person who has unwillingly been possessed by an extraordinary spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, after his battle with Rugato, in which he release his ability suppression, he has been subjected to Tiamat's interference in the form of dreams, and the presence of the giant dragon casts a great shadow over Nozomu's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Maybe there is some clue about Tiamat or the Dragon Slayer ......) Nozomu gulps and continues reading the next page.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  Tiamat  and  the  Dragon  Slayer  are  now  legendary,  and  Nozomu  only  has  enough knowledge of them to be generally known.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he could not stop himself from having faint expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'One  famous  exception  is  the  miracle  usurper  known  as  the  dragon  slayer.  They  are  human beings who have kill and taken in a dragon power, a spirit of immense power. The dragon and the dragon-slayer will be described in another book, but they are troublesome and a disaster in their own right'</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disaster. Nozomu's heart skipped a beat at the word. Apparently, the author of this book had also studied dragon slayer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the book Nozomu picked up did not contain any further information he sought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Usurper ....... The author of this book is Grisden Harantide. is there any others?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  there  is  a  book  on  the  shelves  that  describes  the  Dragon  Slayer.  Nozomu  looked through the books on the shelf with a faint hope. However, contrary to Nozomu's expectations, Grisden's book was not on the shelf.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-81"></a>Then Nozomu hears a strange noise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? What's that sound?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The clamor drifted in on a slight breeze from the back of the spacious library. The other students were unaware of it, but Nozomu's hearing, trained in the forests of Spasim, caught the sound of the voices streaming from the passageway leading to the closed stacks of space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I told you it's an accusation. I don't know"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You don't know? You're an elf, you don't know what kind of dirty tricks you're up to"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The conversation was anything but calm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I approached the direction of the voice and quietly peeked into the back from the shadows of the passageway to see a blue-haired elf with a book in her arms surrounded by three beastly female students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is one other student, far away from the three, who is gathering greenish magic power in her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  definitely  magic.  Considering  that  it  was  difficult  to  hear  their  voices  despite  the  close distance, I could guess that they were probably using wind magic to block the sound. Moreover, one of the surrounding beastmen was a female student who belonged to Kevin's party yesterday and had reported the results to the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's Shina-san. And those beastsman, were they ...... named yesterday, Calanti, I think?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calanti, as far as the eye can see, is a beastman of a silver wolf tribe. Her pale gray ears and tail sprout from her head and skirt. She is in second class, as seen by the blue nameplate on her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she is about the same height as Shina, the beastman's physical capabilities are quite impressive despite her appearance. At the very least, she would be able to crush an apple with her bare hands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you do ....... When you're using magic, you've got quite a problem"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously, the use of magic and qijutsu is prohibited in the library, where valuable materials are stored.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The argument between Shina and Caranti continued as Nozomu hesitated about what to do in the situation before him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Move out. You are in my way"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you think I would have retreated when you told me to, I wouldn't have done this in the first place. Oh, it's no use calling Mimulu the cat-tail, she's with her boyfriend right now"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With anger in her eyes, Calanti twisted Shina's arm. She frowned at the pain in her arm, and the book she was holding was scattered on the floor with a rustling sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let go of me!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why don't you just shake it off by force? Or put your trust in your spirit friends. But you can't do that, can you, failure elf?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What's that again about being a failure? ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-82"></a>"Shut up ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes take on a dangerous angry color.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is clearly out of sorts, but Calanti shows no signs of being intimidated by her anger, but rather begins to radiate an even greater rage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll say it again and again, you failed elf. You have lost the blessing of the spirits and have been abandoned"</p>
<p class="calibre1">（Lost the blessings of the spirits?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was surprised, but listened closely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Or should I call you cowards? You all ignored warnings and were easily defeated by demons, and then left their families who were trying to protect their homeland and fled on their own"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps her emotions had been swept away, and blue magic power began to overflow from Shina's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was not good. There was no telling what would happen to her if she got into a violent situation in the library. It would be fine if it was only a suspension, but in some cases, it could result in expulsion from school, or worse, jail or prison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No  one  involved  will  be  treated  well.  The  moment  he  became  aware  of  this,  Nozomu reflexively raised his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me! Is there anyone here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Must, rely on authority.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loud voices  in  a quiet library are noticeable anyway. There is  no doubt  that people will be rushing to the library soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, hey, Calanti, this isn't good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's the bottom feeder that being parasite on the black-haired princess! Why didn't I notice that!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  now  Calanti  and  the  others  also  noticed  Nozomu's  presence.  Even  though  the  voice  is attenuated by wind magic, the soundproofing is not perfect. That is why it is effective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once they knew that the museum staff would be rushing to the scene, Calanti and the others had no time to get involved with Shina any further. And in fact, the situation turned out just as Nozomu wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih, it can't be helped. That's it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While the beastsmans were shaken by the unexpected situation, Calanti glared at Nozomu in frustration and gave instructions to her dismayed companions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the instructions were given, the beastsmans were quick to act. Once the wind magic was lifted,  they  used  their  natural  agility  to  head  in  the  direction  of  the  open-air  library  where Nozomu was standing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll remember this, bottom feeder"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-83"></a>While the others run away at once, only Karanti swears at Nozomu as they pass each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, she was quite upset at being interrupted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she quickly took her gaze away from  Nozomu, stopped once, and glared again  at Shina, who remained in the aisle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because of you fairy tribe, we wolf tribe have lost many of our families. I will never allow you to be here"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving behind one last bitterness-strangled note, Calanti then  runs off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After making sure the girls disappeared behind the bookshelves, Nozomu fearfully stepped out from behind the aisle and appeared in front of Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, ...... are you okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes widen in surprise when she sees Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu, who was also present at the awkward scene, is not sure what to say, so he shuts down. Meanwhile, the staff arrives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's up?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh, well, actually, it's ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to explain to the library staff, who look at him suspiciously, but before he can explain, two figures appear from the open stack space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're late Shina, what's wrong, you still ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's up?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two who approached them were Tom  and Mimuru, who happened to  fight  together the other day when they fought the magical beast on the main road.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They looked over at Shina, Nozomu, and the library staff, and tilted their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... It's nothing. I just dropped off a few borrowed books. I borrowed it from the closed shelves so he was a little startled and made a sound"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, I dropped this book here ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't see any scratches on it, so it won't be a problem, but be careful. Everything in here is valuable"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am sorry"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was stunned, Shina, who was supposed to be the victim, put the situation behind her as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the library staff left, Shina exhaled loudly, as if relieved, and handed the materials she was carrying to Tom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, is this the book you were looking for?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yes, thank you!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-84"></a>"Shina, what happened to you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I just had a little fun with a very energetic dog"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A energetic dog. Mimuru, who has known Shina for a while, just from that, frowned grimly, as if she had guessed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, who had received the materials, also looked at Shina with concern.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the elf  girl  looks back at  Nozomu,  trying her best  not  to  notice the melancholy gaze that is directed at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And just so you know, I want to thank you as well. Thank you, but I don't need your help"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah~, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, Mimuru, let's go"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have nothing more to do with this. Nozomu could not say anything more to Shina, who told him so clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah~, that's right. Hey Nozomu. Do you have time now?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mimuru, who was watching next to him, easily broke the heavy atmosphere"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waa?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She looks into Nozomu's face with interest and smiles meaningfully with a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come with us for a minute. It's okay, it's okay! I won't eat you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, but ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry about that tsuntsun elf. Come on, let's go, let's go! Tom's good, too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay, I was going to take a break too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa~, wait!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat beastman, full of energy, took Nozomu's and Shina's hands and started to walk away, leaving Shina's dismay behind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was taken by the cat beastman, who was so surprised by his action that the elf girl sighed in resignation.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was brought to a break area in one corner of the library.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tea and simple snacks were placed in front of Nozomu, who was seated at a square table for four.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To Nozomu's right is Tom, and to his left is Shina. Mimuru is sitting across from him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrangement is as if they are being interrogated. And under Mimuru's amused, smirking gaze, Nozomu shivered uncomfortably.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, so why am I here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-85"></a>"Well, that's okay. I just wanted to ask you something"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru closes the distance as if leaning forward, and Nozomu involuntarily bends over in his chair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is it that you want to ask me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not a big deal, isn't it? How did you get so close to the black-haired princess?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was inwardly convinced that this was the case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina Francilt is the lone, or rather untouchable existence among the three grades. If she had formed a party with Nozomu, who is said to be a particularly inferior student in the school, it would be rare for her not to be bothered from it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can understand if it was just an occasional party, but it seems that you were invited to lunch too. That's why, impossible not to be concerned about it~~"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it is possible that she could at least have an occasional  party at the request of the guild, for example.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she visited the tenth-grade classroom herself to invite Nozomu to lunch. It was as if she was trying to convey that they were that close.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, during the afternoon class on the day she invited him to lunch, Nozomu was exposed to countless suspicious and murderous stares from his classmates. If it had not been for Mars, he might have been taken to the back of the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you understand? If it's just circumstantial evidence, it's totally a royal straight flush, right"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What,  I've never heard  that word before.  I just happened to  be in  a place where they were fighting demonic beasts in the Spasim forest .......Well, I guess it was too poorly for you to only watch, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was getting tired of these pursuit after pursuit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he was afraid to mention the problems between the Francilt and Waziart families.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, on the other hand, is not happy with Nozomu's response, and her mouth curves up in a grimace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ---. I don't have a choice, If you in such a deep relationship with her! You're about to brag about it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What? You sound like a stupid pick-up artist ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry. Mimuru is a bit of a hothead ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry? What do you mean by hothead ----!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, perhaps getting a headache from Mimuru's excessive behavior, was down on her face with her hand on her forehead before she knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  Mimuru's  frustration  exploded  at  Shina  for  her  lack  of  follow-up  support.  She stands up with her hands in the air, but her loud voice causes the students around her, who had been reading quietly, to glare at her all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru,  which  her  tail  curled  up  in  a  squeak  at  the  countless  stares  of  protest,  awkwardly lowers her raised hand and takes her seat.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-86"></a>"Mmm-hmm! Besides, you're not as weak as people say. Just look the yesterday's fight"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Can you tell?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, yes. I may look like this, but I'm still a second-class student, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru smiles proudly as she leans on the back of her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as Nozomu can see, she must be a very talented person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beastmen originally have higher physical abilities than humans, but tend to be crude in their handling of qi and magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a side effect of being born with high ability, but as far as Nozomu senses, the qi she wears seems quite refined.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So  what  is  Nozomu's  relationship  with  the  Black-Haired  Princess?  Lover?  Mistress?  Or  a servant?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm just wondering why I don't get the normal answer of friends....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not the boring answer I'm looking for!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to her such high ability, this Neko-tail girl's character and behavior were too disappointing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt that he had recently had too many encounters with people who did not listen to the words of others, such as the old man at the fortune teller in the commercial district and this girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru, you can't make any more noise"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fumyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, who had been standing next to her and watching what was going on, reached out his hand to Mimuru's head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's body shudders when he pinches her bushy ears as if he were petting his cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the momentum that had been making so much noise earlier suddenly slowed down, and her body plopped down on the table with no energy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rumble ....... Every time Tom stroked her ear, the sound of grooming echoed through the rest area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry Mimuru has been so noisy. I know I'm late, but I haven't seen you since yesterday, Nozomu-kun"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yes. Tom-kun, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm fine with 'Tom.' I'm calling both Mimuru and Shina"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom talks to Nozomu, petting Mimuru with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the distance between this boy Tom and Mimuru is very close. It is the kind of distance that would be bothersome to someone around Nozomu's age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, this is a impolite question, but I was wondering if you two might be ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, yeah...... in case you're wondering"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-87"></a>That alone gave Nozomu an idea of their relationship. Love between a beastman and a human tribe is rare, but not entirely unheard of.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu knows this, and she could tell that the two were truly attracted to each other, even in this short period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's gentle disposition can also be sensed from Mimuru's gurgling and joyful expression, and there is no aversion or separation in the way he looks at Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, on the other hand, also smiles at Nozomu's lack of flirtation with his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I saw you yesterday, are you an alchemist?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boyish looking classmate is not wearing that heavy cloak today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, he has a pile of borrowed books on the table, as if he intends to read during the break.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the titles of the books, many of them are about alchemy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, yes. But I'm also studying magic, so I guess I'm more of a researcher"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alchemy is the study of all the substances that exist in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, it was opened by those who thought about the origins of the world from the shape of  stones,  and  it  has  come  to  this  day  through  fusion  with  the  magical  studies  of  various countries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of its origins, it has material aspects, such as earth and water, rather than immaterial aspects, such as light and darkness, and is expected to play a major role in society in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom is amazing! At his age, he's already been invited to Grorerum!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Really?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, well. I'm helping with alchemy and the development of new magic techniques. I haven't achieved anything yet myself, so I'm still an apprentice"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom  himself was  scratching his  cheeks  in  a slightly  embarrassed manner, perhaps  happy to receive Mimuru's praise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,  Nozomu  was  also  surprised  to  hear  that  he  had  been  invited  to  the  Glorerum Institution.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Glorerum  Institution  is  a research institute that  forms  the basis of Arcazam.  It  was  this institution  that  researched  and  systematized  the  techniques  related  to  qiatsu  and  magic  that were scattered all over the Arkmill continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the best and brightest people with open and lucid minds were gathered from all over the world, and even though he was only an apprentice, his excellence was proven by the fact that he had a seat as a student.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's really awesome ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you. So, can I ask you a favor?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, that sword you're holding is from the Far East, isn't it? I'd like to take a look at it"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-88"></a>With a twinkle and a glint of curiosity in his eyes, Tom pointed to the sword at Nozomu's waist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You want to see this? Why? I don't think it has anything to do with alchemy"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, it was a relic of his master, and he believe it is a very famous sword, but Nozomu had never heard about it from Shino.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the one hand, a study of the West, and on the other, a weapon of the Far East. In Nozomu's mind, alchemy and swords were not connected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not  really,  that's  probably  a  pretty  famous  sword,  isn't  it?  Swords  from  the  East  are  a mysterious mass that cannot be understood by our magical theory. Maybe it's a famous spiritual sword that has defeated demons, or maybe it's a mysterious sword that has avenged itself on the Eastern Dynasties!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that can't be it. Why is it that only the part that is said to be so powerful is so strange?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's wishful thinking was mixed in with this line, and Nozomu could not help but calmly interject.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was also true that he felt his feelings were shaken when he was stared at with such pure eyes on top of his already boyish appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, as long as you don't break it, it's fine"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Nozomu decided to show Tom his beloved sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He removed the sword from his sword belt and held it out with both hands, keeping it in its sheath with the blade up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you! Then let's get right to it ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom accepted the sword with joy and pulled it out of its sheath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a "kung ......" the metal collar is removed from the scabbard, exposing the sword's elegant blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uwa ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heh ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom and Mimuru let out an exclamation of admiration. Nozomu himself looked at the blade of his master's beloved sword, and once again thought that it had a beautiful blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade has a smooth ripple on the surface of the ground that reminds one of the rings on the years of a large tree. When you hold it up to the light, you can see star-like sparkles shimmering like a kaleidoscope in the streaks like a stream poured into the blade.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2SnSnZ4/000001.jpg" alt="000001" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-90"></a>"It's beautiful ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Shina, who had been silent with a Buddhist expression on her face, seemed to have been taken aback by the beauty of Nozomu's sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sure, it's a very beautiful sword, but ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's no atmosphere of qi or magic in it. But ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light of intellectual curiosity returns to Tom's eyes, which had been purely gawking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  unlike  his  childlike  eyes  earlier,  what  I  see  in  his  eyes  now  is  an  intense  will  to explore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This light of exploration brings up a bad premonition in Nozomu's head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once erased? That's why so much ....... But  I don't think there are many people who could break the will that resides in such an armament ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey, wait, can we go now?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's eyes light up with a hint of danger. Beside the relic of his master to which his eyes are directed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Following his intuition, Nozomu attempts to retrieve his beloved sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But there is no doubt that it was a magic sword or something of the sort. Perhaps there are traces of it somewhere at ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But instead of returning the sword to Nozomu, Tom turned around and looked back at him with his dangerous, inquiring eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's hand stops reaching for his sword as his eyes glare at Tom, who cower in fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm gonna have to disassemble this sword"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, Whaaaa~, no!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom began to disassemble Nozomu's sword in the blink of an eye. He put the sword back in its scabbard and removed the eye nail nails with a wooden mallet and eye-drawing stick he had taken out of his pocket. This took five seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu wonders where he has the tool, Tom taps the handle lightly with a mallet and removes the handle. And this all happened in five seconds. Tom's grasp of the sword's structure and the speed with which he disassembles it are astonishing, even though he does not know much about swords.</p>
<p class="softbreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nowhere is the name of the maker given. A famous sword without a name? But maybe ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-91"></a>"No! Where are you going to take it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where? The laboratory. Break the blade a bit and check the cross section ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment  he heard Tom's  line, Nozomu  used all his  strength  to  retrieve the sword,  even using qijutsu to strengthen his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deprived of an interesting object of study in an instant, Tom screamed in grief.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah! It's an amazing research material~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's with the research material thing? I just told you not to break it!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, this boy was so inquisitive that he stopped listening to others when his tag was removed.  In  a  sense,  they  are  very  much  alike,  since  his  lover,  the  beastman,  also  does  not listen to others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As  Nozomu  was  having  such  an  impression  and  yapping  for  a  while,  Tom,  who  had  been running wild with intellectual curiosity, finally regained his composure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, sorry, I just got a little carried away with the unexpected bargain"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom scratched his head in embarrassment as he spoke these words, but Nozomu's gaze was cold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was understandable, since he had taken his master's belongings without permission and tried to use them as research material.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that ...... sorry"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, as expected, bowed his head, as if he was aware of the insanity of his own actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu sighed, Mimul asked again about the identity of Nozomu's sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what's this sword ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhn, I don't know"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's matter-of-fact statement made everyone in the room weak.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  almost  collapsed  on  the  spot,  and  Mimuru  plopped  down  on  her  desk.  Shina  was holding her temples as if enduring a headache.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The person name who made the sword is engraved on the handle of the sword, but there is no name on the sword. I'm not a sword expert, so I can't identify the name of the sword or appraise it, even the magical effect on the sword ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not surprising since the sword itself is a rare item of Eastern continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also,  according  to  Tom,  the  magical  effect  that  was  once  given  to  this  sword  has  been completely erased, and there is nothing left at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But  I know it's  a very special sword.  It  was originally called a  "spirit sword" or  a  "demon sword," and is known to have been used in the past"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sacred sword, the magic sword, the demon sword, and the spirit sword are weapons that appear in various legends and heroic tales, and they have abilities that are distinctly different from those of the magic swords that are usually made by attaching magic spells.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-92"></a>They have the ability to increase the wielder's magical power without limit, to annihilate the enemy at the cost of the wielder's body or soul, or to gather the source elements of the earth to give the wielder the power of a spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The characteristic of these weapons was that they had some kind of will. In other words, they are living weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widen involuntarily at the possibility that his own sword, or more precisely, his master's sword, is  of considerable provenance, even though it is  now a completely ordinary sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, where did you get this sword?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It belonged to my master. I'm sorry to say that I don't know anything about the origin of this sword ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, really? Where is your master?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Already passed away"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I'm sorry ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he heard the meaning "passed away," a shadow appeared on Tom's face. Mimuru and Shina also looked somewhat uncomfortable and averted their gazes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A delicate atmosphere flowed between Nozomu and the three of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay. You didn't know, so never mind"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu puts back the hilt, which had come off, and after fitting and securing the eye nail, he puts the sword back on his sword belt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There he realized that he had talked for quite a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well then, I'd better be on my way"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is about to leave, thinking that he has had enough, even for a break.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But as he was about to leave, Tom called out to him in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, thank you for saving Shina"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sudden words of gratitude directed at him made Nozomu stop and look back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom, who had been showing a shadowy face earlier, somehow had a bright smile on his face that showed no sign of that negative shade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks!  By  the  way,  you  are  quite  a  good-natured  fellow  to  help  such  an  unsociable  and unhelpful elf, as rumor has it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru also smiled as brightly as or brighter than Tom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, they both had a idea of what had happened to Shina on the earlier passage to the closed library. And that they were genuinely grateful to Nozomu for helping their friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">............"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-93"></a>Shina, on the other hand, looked away awkwardly and stood up when Nozomu turned to look at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on, we should get going too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I already said thank you for Shina"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No problem. She's already thanked me for my help. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's ears perked up at his words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had indeed received a thank-you note from Shina, but it was somewhat difficult to take it as a thank-you note.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shina, the delicate air between them. However, Shina left without even looking at Nozomu, taking Tom and Mimuru with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Really, What the hell is this ..... '</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elf of the Sumahya Union. In the indescribable, rancorous air, Nozomu exhales loudly once more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't want her to thank me. I don't know about you, but I just couldn't keep silent at the sight of her being stuffed like that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the silent rejection was too much for Nozomu to bear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wound in his chest began to ache as if it had been touched by salt water.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... ouch)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  moment  when  his  former  lover  rejected  him  came  back  to  his  mind,  and  Nozomu involuntarily clenched his hand on his chest and bit his lip tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a while after that, Nozomu walks around the library, not returning to Irisdina and the others until the pain in his chest subsides.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nothing. Let's hurry up, I'm sure you have something to do"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's true ... but"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru catches up with Shina, who goes ahead of her, and questions her about what she said and did earlier. The elf girl, on the other hand, does not answer Mimuru's question and hands Tom the book she was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fairy race have always had a high barrier against other races, but even from Mimuru's point of view, Shina's words and actions toward Nozomu were clearly biased.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom too, you have to go to the lab now. Here you go"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhn, yeah, thanks"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While questioning Shina's somewhat pushy behavior, Tom accepts the materials she brings to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-94"></a>"You are welcome. Then ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  corners  of  Shina's  eyes,  which  had  a  hard  expression  on  her  face,  dropped  and  turned shadowy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know. I'll have it ready for you and you can come to the lab tomorrow or the next day or the day after. Well, I can't promise that I'll be successful ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problems faced by Shina Yuriel. The reason why she is called "Kareha-eared" (dead ears).</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is an elf loved by spirits, but she has the fatal problem of not being able to use spirit magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina has made it one of her goals at the school to solve this problem, and for this purpose, she has been working with Tom and his colleagues, who are alchemists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, two years have passed since they came to Arcazam, and the progress has not been good. Shina has not been able to re-contract with the spirits, or even sense their presence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina thanks Tom for his cooperation, but his face is still very shadowy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Muuu....... Somehow about the two of you being so close"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of them are very good friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, you can't! Even Shina, i won't give it to you! Tom is my groom!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina is stunned and confused, but Mimuru is jealous and says, "I won't let you have it!" Shina is stunned and disappointed, but Mimuru is jealous and hugs Tom from behind, her tail wagging menacingly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mi mu~umu~u! Mu~a mu~a mi-me! Mume, Mume mu~a a!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gyuu  gyuu  gyuu!  Tom  is  hugged  to  his  lover's  chest  with  all  her  might.  His  lungs  are compressed, but the soft yet inviting sensation he feels on his back causes his complexion to flash blue and red in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know. I don't have those feelings. But your groom is in trouble, isn't he?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? Uwaaaa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kyu......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, coming back to herself at Shina's words, hurriedly released him, but Tom's eyes had completely turned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He  had  a  slightly  horrified  look  on  his  face,  with  a  congested  complexion  and  a  prodigal melting expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaah! Tom, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ----!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina frowned as she remembered her classmate from earlier, while smiling wryly at Mimuru, who began to care for Tom with a flinch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What was that feeling ......?)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-95"></a>That is the same sensation I felt the other day when I was clearing out the demonic beasts on the main road. Last time it was like a needle lightly touching my skin, but today it felt like my whole body was tingling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's very, very scary. But I miss it....... I don't know why I felt that way. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a sudden but strange sensation that made her whole body stiffen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  what  made  her  feel  more  uncomfortable  than  anything  else  was  that  the  sensation  was accompanied by a sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The warm spring breeze felt chilly for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A chill crawled up her spine, and Shina involuntarily crossed her arms as if to hug herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It can't be. It's like when the spirits got angry ...... that it was the same feeling as when our forests burned ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last of my hometown comes back to my mind. Then, the demise of the spirits. She found herself biting her lip tightly, feeling as if she were opening a wound from the past that could not be erased.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness of night, the distant howling of beasts echoes through the spasim forest, and a herd of four-legged beasts runs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frostboar.  As  the  name  suggests,  these  boar-shaped  demonic  beasts  inhabit  the  forest.  The larger ones are beasts with enough power to smash even small huts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They  are omnivorous,  have a voracious  appetite, and are fierce  and merciless  in  their fangs against anyone who tries to harm them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These boars were fleeing for their lives. They were trying to escape from the huge shadow that loomed behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the predator scoffs at the boars' desperate escape. The predator, cloaked in wind, catches up with the boar herd in the blink of an eye, turns around the herd's escape route, and with its tusks, turns the three boars in the lead into a mass of meat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Piggy!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The herd of boars, having lost the individual that was leading the pack, instantly scatters into four pieces. It broke apart and attempted to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The predator's tail was raised high in front of the herd as it tried to scatter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Illuminated by the moonlight, magical light gathers on the tail, which is wrapped in gray fur.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three seconds, four seconds, five seconds ...... a single flash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With  a  sound  that  cuts  through  the  air,  invisible  blades  and  shears  scatter  in  all  directions, slaughtering the remaining boars that were about to disperse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A gray predator stood still amidst the mass of flesh-turned-frostbores. It was a large size wolf, even larger than the demonic beast with magic-stone that Nozomu and his party had fought.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-96"></a>Gray fur covered its entire body. Only the neck was reddish-blood red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gray, evil wolf roared with satisfaction as it held its prey in front of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if called by its howl, a large number of direwolves emerged from the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They numbered around sixty. The wolves, who numbered around sixty, were in extraordinary numbers, and each one of them began to bite at the dismembered remains of the dead frostboar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" big wolf looked at his herdmates with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Garm. It is a higher ranking magical beast than Geyerwolf, and is the leader of this herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason they came to this area was because they needed a new hunting ground to maintain their growing herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku~u~u~u …"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While the herd was engrossed in its meal, a direwolf came up to the "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a direwolf with a magic stone that had escaped from the battle on the road earlier. This one was one of the herd led by "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" rubbed the tip of its nose in suspicion at the exhausted appearance of the returning wolf, and listened to the sobbing of the returning magical beast. As if to ask what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, after hearing the report of the direwolf, a clear sense of anger comes into the eyes of the "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">What was reported was the death of a fellow member of the herd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What made it more furious than anything else was the fact that "the grey watchman" was also among those killed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in response to the "gray" emotion, magic surged from its body. The other wolves, who were eating, stopped eating as if in response to the leader's anger, and turned toward him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A howl tinged with grief and anger roared through the spasim forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cries of grief and anger from the "gray" soon spread to the rest of the pack, echoing through the forest in a never-ending chorus of howls.</p>
