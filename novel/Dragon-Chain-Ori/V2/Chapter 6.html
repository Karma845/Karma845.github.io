<h3>Chapter 6: Shadow of the Innocents</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was lost in thought as he made his way back to the student dormitory from the Francilt Mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was confronted with the feelings he had continued to turn away from. It is not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he realized that he was running away, a part of his mind was still screaming that he didn't want to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This half-hearted action makes him feel as if he is floating in midair, unable to find his footing, and it is driving him to anxiety and frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is understandable that it is not good enough as it is. But as soon as he fixes it, the feeling that it's still not good enough begins to creep up on his neck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be easier if he could just turn his back again and forget about it. But he cannot do that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ìt's okay to run away, but don't turn your back on the fact that you ran away.`</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the last thing his master taught him, and it is the solid core bone that shapes the person he is today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Greed and wish, desire and anguish. Two conflicting emotions continue to clash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malice has been at work.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, the words of another benefactor come back to life, and the calm part of his head speaks to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That time when he was getting impatient to make up for the gap between himself and those around him that kept opening up. It is true that for a time, he did not see Lisa as often as he used to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, he began to avoid seeing her himself. He was ashamed of himself for only being cared for forever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And who was by their side at that time .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrr ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, with a roar, the dark lakeside appears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a scene he had once seen in a dream. If you drop your gaze to the surface of the still water, you will see a five-colored, six-winged dragon at the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tied up by chains and with its mouth closed, the dragon looks up at Nozomu, who is standing on the surface of the lake, and slurps his throat as he looks at him with a deep, penetrating gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as if the dragon were whispering something to him about his hesitation, as if insulting him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu shook his head and said to himself, "I am uncomfortable with the way it looks at me."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-164"></a>‘This is a dream, and nothing can be done while i'm here.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  impatience,  anxiety,  and  the  temptation  of  sweet  escape  continue  to  lure  him.  He  is determined to seize his heart once again with these chains.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the first place, what's the point of me staying in this school ......? I haven't had that so called little dreams yet,  so i don't really have to stay ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘I've unintentionally become a dragon slayer, but if I'm going to live like this without releasing the power of Tiamat, why bother?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice that came out of his mouth and the words that floated in his brain shook the heavenly balance bottle of his mind even more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He don't know how long he have been walking to the central park, but if he look up, he see the street leading to the south gate of Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He want to go through this street and leave the city as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He shook his head and shook off the impulse that had unexpectedly popped into his mind. He understand that such a thought itself was born from his own desire to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(If it's to move forward, then fine. But I can't use it as a reason to make excuses anymore ......) The desire to escape from a reality that does not turn out as one wishes. And unawareness of escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is already aware of the latter. However, he has not yet been able to escape from the cage of escapism.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, because he is aware of his own escape and stagnation, he is dazzled by his new friends, including Irisdina and Somia, who are moving toward the future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The parting of the ways with his master has lit a fire deep in his heart, but the flame is still small.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, you can be more confident. You are more wonderful than you think you are."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Irisdina's words added more heat to the fire burning deep in his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His face naturally turned upward and his gaze left the street leading to the south gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Come to think of it, she was trying to move forward too ......) His eyes, off the main street, turn spontaneously to the central park at night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In his mind's eye, the image of the elf girl who used to train here comes back to his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina Yuriel. A girl who had lost the power she once possessed and was scorned just like him, but struggled to keep her feet on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What's the difference between me and her? ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina is trapped in a similar bind, but she continues to move forward, while he is stagnant. The difference between the two is deeply troubling to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-165"></a>At that moment, he noticed a faint light leaking from the shadows of the trees lining the central park.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't think that was ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light peeking through the trees reminded him of the scene he had seen yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He found himself walking into the central park woods as if lured by the shimmering light like a luring moth.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">That evening, Shina was once again visiting the woods in the central park.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose was to have another successful interaction with the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she had already done so thousands and tens of thousands of times, she had not heard a word from the spirits since the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It might not be possible again. As if to shake off the backward thoughts that are rising in her mind, Shina takes a deep breath once to  calm her mind and begins to draw out her magical power and dissipate it into the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What she is trying to do is to make a contract with a spirit. As the name suggests, it is the art of borrowing power from a spirit in exchange for one's own power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Everyone, please answer me ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The azure blue magic power, similar to her hair color, scatters on the branches and leaves of the trees in the night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirits are beings born from the source, which is considered the most fundamental power in this world. Therefore, they can also feed on qi and magic power, which are the power derived from the source element.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  magical  power  of  elves,  who  have  a  high  affinity  with  spirits,  is  one  of  the  most delicious things for spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time that Shina begins to dissipate her magic, particles of light, different from her magic, begin to fly around her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Tōu-san, Kāa-san, Nēe-san, Raz……)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The families that were taken from her mind. Shina, in particular, was especially close to her sister and Razward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's sister is a "High Elf" who makes a pact with the Great Tree of Nebula Forest, and such a sister was her goal and admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, there is Raz.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His real name is Razward. He was a minor spirit in the form of a small bird of the color of lapis lazuli, with whom Shina once made a contract.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-166"></a>Among elves, there are only a few who can make a contract with a minor spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just the fact that she was able to do so at an early age shows the talent she once possessed. Like her older sister, Shina also had an affinity with spirits that was outstanding among the elves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, despite her resourcefulness, she is unable to hear the spirits' voices at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why ...? Why won't they answer me ....?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The connection with the lost spirit. The half of her body that has disappeared since the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic power is being sent. But nothing is heard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is it no good again?</p>
<p class="calibre1">An  inextinguishable  sense  of  loss,  frustration  and  anger  at  the  frustrating  reality,  welled  up from deep within her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nebula Forest, her hometown, is not on the verge of being liberated due to the difficult terrain  characteristics  of  being  constantly  shrouded  in  fog,  the  increasingly  powerful  and numerous demonic beasts, and the exhaustion of the nations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, something may have happened to the great tree in the center of the forest, and the forest's  plants  themselves  have  been  transformed  into  something  that  is  roughly  harmful  to humans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three times troops have been dispatched to the Nebula Forest to retake it, but most of them have been wiped out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I must take back the forest at all costs, and yet ......!) Reclaim the forest of Nebula, her hometown. That is her goal and mission.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, contrary to her thoughts, the fine spirits who had gathered around her trembled and began to leave Shina's side as if they were fleeing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, please!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She raised her voice, but her thoughts did not reach them, and the spirits disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was no good again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Discouragement  caused  a  choking  feeling  as  if  she  had  swallowed  lead,  and  unanswered questions, grief, and resentment mixed together to become a fever that burned her whole body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the voice of someone who was not herself reached Shina's ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned around as quickly as she could, raising her voice. There was Nozomu Bountis, who had suddenly visited Torgrain's laboratory the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why is this person here? ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-167"></a>The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the person who wants to be seen is seen by someone who doesn't want to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......It's you again."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care. I honestly don't trust you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's expression hardens at her tone of voice, which is as harsh as ever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Swallowing the discomfort rising in the back of his throat, Nozomu slowly opens his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can I ask you why you are so mean to me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't like people who betray others. You know that, don't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu  says  that he remembers it, he is  reminded for a moment  that he is  a dragon slayer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragons are spirits with physical bodies, and their power is outstanding among spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The existence of a dragon slayer, who is born as a result of slaying a dragon, is something to be abhorred by the elves who coexist with the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But  then,  her  rejection  seems  to  be  different.  Shina's  attitude  toward  Nozomu  is  one  of  not wanting to be involved rather than eliminating him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reminds himself that she is avoiding him for a different reason than that he is a dragon slayer, and he stifles the turmoil swirling in the pit of his stomach so as not to be noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I never knew you to begin with ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lisa Hounds. Don't tell me you don't know her."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened at the sudden mention of Lisa's name. He had not expected to hear from her the name of a childhood sweetheart he had once been attracted to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Betrayal is one of the most destructive factors in a relationship with another person, but elves also have a race and historical background.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, elves have the ability to contract with spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are raised with the spirits from an early age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this environment, spirits are contracted through magic power, and there is always a being with whom they can communicate with. In such an environment, elves regard the connection with spirits as sacred, but at the same time, they have come to fear the loss of the contract and the very existence of spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the act of betrayal is their greatest taboo.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute, are you talking about the rumors? I don't know what you've been hearing, but that rumor is a lie ..... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not only do you betray her, but you also lie and deceive. It's just so disgusting."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-168"></a>"Lies, huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Shina's words and actions clearly did not indicate that she had only heard the story through others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I saw it happen. I saw you betray her. ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean, ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is hard to understand why. In the first place, Nozomu did not commit such a traitorous act.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  that  time,  he  was  spending  his  days  only  training  desperately  and  could  not  afford  such unnecessary actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But, ignoring Nozomu's upset, Shina began to tell him what she had seen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was crying, clinging to you. She asked why. Why? And you rejected her out of hand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute! I don't know what's going on! In the first place, gosh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was about to close in, but Shina instantly took an arrow to the bow on her back and fired an arrow that grazed Nozomu's cheek. The pain stopped Nozomu in his tracks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's really not a good idea. This is why I don't trust people who lie. They're so unconcerned that they try to paint their lies with another lies ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina puts magic power into the engraved arrow and releases it again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrow flew in a straight line toward Nozomu and exploded right in front of him, sending out a powerful flash of light and a shockwave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's mouth emits a groan as he is blown away and slammed into a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ugh, ugh ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He bites his lip to endure the pain and his whole body trembles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain and bitterness running through his entire body, and above all, the disdainful look from Shina, opened the wound that had been carved in Nozomu's heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't play dumb with me ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">What  followed  was  intense  anger.  A  rage  that  is  released  to  protect  oneself  from  an unreasonable reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger that had been stifled for so long by the means of escape, once ignited, spreads like a forest fire in the dry season.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lies? You don't believe me? I'm the one who wants to tell you to stop screwing around ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a low, angry voice that seemed to resonate deep in the pit of her stomach. Shina's face, hit by the anger, became tense all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, carried away by the fury, stood up and ran out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He grabbed her arms and chest, which were frozen in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-169"></a>"Which one of you didn't believe it! Which one!. If you decide how I felt ...... that is they are the one who betrayed me, then ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With his thoughts dominated by anger, Nozomu railed loudly in front of Shina's eyes. Shina was simply overwhelmed by the words of indignation that were spewed out without falsehood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Shina's arm felt an intense pain and she let out an involuntary yelp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the blink of an eye, Nozomu's anger was tinged with regret and shame.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, I just lost my temper. It's no use telling you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After quickly releasing Shina, Nozomu turned his back on her and turned to leave with unsteady steps.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina is released from her restraints, but she remains stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't betray Lisa ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were squeezed out without force and without falsehoods, and they pierced Shina's heart deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world is going on ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only thing Shina could do was to stand there, stunned by Nozomu's  depressed state, so much so that even the anger she had been harboring just a moment ago had faded away.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  day  after  his  argument  with  Shina,  Nozomu  was  alone  in  the  Spasim  Forest,  taking advantage of the holiday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason for this was that he had been through so much recently and needed some time to calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something that caught his concern in the argument on the other day. It was Shina's statement that she had seen Nozomu betray his friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is something that Nozomu has no recollection of, but at the same time it is very important evidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  very  least,  she  knows  some  important  facts  about  the  rumors  that  spread  during Nozomu's first year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Nozomu regretted that he should have listened to her more closely. Even though she had lost her temper, it was an obvious blunder to raise her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His own pettiness and disappointment welled up from deep within his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  smell  of  plants  and  trees  in  his  nostrils  gently  calmed  his  spiraling  mind.  Nozomu  has always felt that he is more at ease in the forests where demonic beasts roam around than in the towns. Nozomu realized that he was on the verge of becoming a recluse, just like his master.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-170"></a>"It's kinda weird ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After  regaining  some  composure,  Nozomu  sensed  something  strange  in  his  surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no sign of animals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There  are  many  demonic  beasts  in  the  forest,  but  there  are  also  many  harmless  animals  in proportion to the number of demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are many types and numbers of rabbits, mice, rats, birds, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In the forest, he could sense their presence, to a lesser or greater degree, and their meat was a valuable source of protein when he was left in the forest alone by his master for training.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"............"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's accumulated experience begins to ring alarm bells at the abnormalities in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His consciousness suddenly begins to naturally be alert to his surroundings, and his heart rate increases  slightly  to  ensure  that  his  body  is  ready  to  fight  at  any  moment,  and  his  blood  is pumping throughout his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The senses become more acute than normal.  He eliminates even the  ringing in  his  ears and heartbeat that echoes in the silence and focuses his awareness on his surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, mixed with the sound of branches fluttering in the wind, he hears the voices of several people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, they are quite far away from each other, and it is hard to make out what they are talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I believe that is where multiple medicinal herbs grow wild, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if they are not subject to guild assessment, medicinal herbs themselves are often utilized by Nozomu. He decided to take advantage of this opportunity to save some for himself, and turned his feet toward the sound of the voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He then wades through the bushes to get to the overgrown plants and trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, Nozomu reflexively twisted his head at the shooting, killing sensation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately afterward, a flash of silver light passed in front of his eyes. It was an arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who is it? If you're not a demon beast, come out. I'll hit you next time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, Wait a minute!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu rushes out of the bushes to avoid being hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There, in a little open space, was a cluster of medicinal herbs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was the blue-haired girl and her friends with whom she had argued yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-171"></a>†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Going back in time a little, around the time when Nozomu was entering the forest, Shina was also invited by Mimuru and Tom to enter the Spasim forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason was to collect alchemical materials for Tom's private research.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, alchemy materials themselves can be obtained at a reasonable price when the student is as promising as Tom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, he had decided to gather the necessary materials in the forest to make an achievement for his girlfriend, Mimuru, and because he had recently been in need of some funds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The weather was a bit dreary and it was drizzling, but Tom was happy to go deeper into the forest, as he had not been able to go into the forest for a while due to the Direwolf's commotion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon arriving at the gathering site, he begins to collect medicinal and aromatic herbs, insects, and fungi growing on the ground as the rain drizzles down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While he collects the materials, Mimuru stays close to Tom, while Shina keeps a watchful eye on the surroundings from afar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the spring rain  soaked her  rainproof cloak, Sina, who was acting as an escort, lifted her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  area  around  Arcazam  was  originally  blessed  with  enough  precipitation  to  form  deep forests. Rain falls regularly throughout the year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina  herself  did  not  dislike  rainy  days.  In  fact,  she  was  one  of  those  who  liked  it.  Her hometown was also blessed with rain, so much so that there was always fog.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, however, it was rather heartbreaking. The quarrel with Nozomu the day before had also stirred her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's the matter, Shina? Did something happen between you and him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, who had been watching Shina from a distance, spoke to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu  Bountis.  He,  I  think  he  had  something  he  wanted  to  ask  Shina,  and  he's  been bothering her a lot lately. What's going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the sound of Mimuru's voice, with  a hint of anticipation at the edge of her words, Shina realized that it was her friend who had told Nozomu where she was training. At the same time, the discomfort swirling in the pit of her stomach grew.</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....No, nothing of the sort, ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmmm ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru  gives  a  meaningful  look  to  Shina,  who  insists  that  nothing  is  going  on  as  if  she  is trying to stifle him, but she eventually shrugs her shoulders in dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-172"></a>"You don't have to tell lies ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not lying ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"you're lying. When Shina lies, her ears twitch unnaturally."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a huff, she presses her own ears, but they don't move in any particular way. But when she sees Shina's reflexive behavior and sees Mimuru smiling meaningfully, she realizes she's been had her fill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew there was something wrong. Why do you hate Nozomu so much? He saved you when that Calanti was trying to hurt you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I saw him. I saw when he actually dumped Lisa-san ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's words brought back to Shina's mind a scene she had seen by chance two years earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He and a strange woman coming out of a brothel in the commercial district. And the red-haired girl who collapsed with a stunned expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that true? You didn't see it wrong or something?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, it was from a distance, but I'm sure that man is Nozomu Bountis, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as she had finished, the face of Nozomu from yesterday popped into her head and she stopped speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice at that time did not have the slightest hint of the muddy atmosphere that people who mend their lies have.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">What was there was a sadness that could not be hidden and resentment at the reality that things were not as they should be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And these feelings are the same as the ones Shina is experiencing right now. That is why she could not continue to speak any longer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, It's nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I don't know why. But at that time, he surely thought about Lisa-san ......) The image of him rescuing her from Calanti's entanglement in the library a few days earlier also stirs her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flashbacks to multiple images of Nozomu, and the indescribable feelings that haunt her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  sense  of  déjà  vu  and  an  uncomfortable  feeling  that  crawls  up  her  spine  makes  Shina involuntarily put her finger to her forehead and bite her lip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is this feeling? It's as if it's all overlapping. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I thought he wasn't that kind of a person, from the way I talked to him in Torgrain-sensei lab."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, we don't really know Nozomu-kun very well ourselves."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know him well ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-173"></a>"Yeah?  We  don't  know  much  about  him  ourselves.  We  only  met  and  talked  with  Nozomu recently."</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Mimuru and Tom's words, Shina couldn't help but look aghast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You  inevitably  need  time  to  get  to  know  the  other  person.  She  herself  was  not  close  with Mimuru and Tom from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was disgusted by Mimuru, who had been following her since she first entered the school, and although she ignored her, they began to talk while they were together, and before she knew it, they were working together like this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as if they were friends of the former spirit who disappeared in the forest of Spasim.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Was I, perhaps, doing the same thing to him that Calanti and the others did?) When judging the character of others, people like to label them as that kind of person. It's easier that way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the words and actions I was directing at Nozomu were the same as those of those who ridiculed me as a "dead leaf ear".</p>
<p class="calibre1">This realization depresses Shina's mind and adds to her confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's thoughts were going round and round like an endless loop, and with her mouth set in a straight line, she began to fiddle with her fine azure hair with her fingertips.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the sound of grass being rustled in Shina's ears caught her attention.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking she had encountered a demonic beast, Shina reflexively readied her bow and fired an arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no response, and her arrow disappeared deep into the grass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina quickly took her next arrow and issued a warning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who is it? If you're not a demon beast, come out. I'll hit you next time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, Wait a minute!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You, ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prompted by Shina's warning, Nozomu emerged from the bushes, the same Nozomu she had harshly slammed yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The appearance of the person she least wanted to see at the moment caused her eyes to widen, followed by a twisted twist of her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an expression of avoidance rather than disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, I knew there was something wrong with you ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, who was looking at Shina's expression with a sideways glance, let out a disgusted voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-174"></a>But  she immediately  changed her  expression and walked up to  Nozomu,  whom she met by chance, waving her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, yoo-hoo. It seems you had a hard time dealing with Shina yesterday."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mimuru, ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way, I want to ask you, is it ...... true that you betrayed Lisa-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's expression turns angry, and his narrowed eyes turn to Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes narrowed as she looked at Nozomu,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......What, it's true!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, her heart ached as she recalled his exhausted appearance yesterday when he mumbled,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I told you I didn't do ...... it, didn't I?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's  words  seem  to  disguise  her  awkwardness,  but  unfortunately,  Nozomu  does  not understand her complicated feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  is  just  as  stubborn.  With  a  stiffened  heart,  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  think  of considering the other party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nyah~~. My thoughts are hardened."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, the two of them are creating an extremely awkward atmosphere, and the source of the spark is watching the match with an indifferent look on the face. Tom, on the other hand, seems to be a little put off by the tense atmosphere of Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere was tense. They don't curse at each other, but the atmosphere is extremely bad because they don't say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is this feeling? It's weird. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This realization depresses Shina's mind and adds to her confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's thoughts were going round and round like an endless loop, and with her mouth set in a straight line, she began to fiddle with her fine azure hair with her fingertips.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Prompted by Shina's warning, Nozomu emerged from the bushes, the same Nozomu she had harshly slammed yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere was tense. They don't curse at each other, but the atmosphere is extremely bad because they don't say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is this feeling? It's weird ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pari, Pari ....... The uncomfortable feeling that had been attacking Shina for a while now finally became bad enough to make her feel sick.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-176"></a>This was followed by a ringing in her ears, as if bells were being rung in her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U-uhh ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain was so great that Shina involuntarily crouched down on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru  notices  the  sudden  change  in  Shina's  appearance  and  grabs  her  right  arm  as  she  is about to collapse. Before she knew it, Shina's complexion had turned completely blue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A~.., Hey, are you all right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had been glaring at her earlier, was surprised by the sudden change in Shina's condition and supported her body from the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, hey!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Called by Mimuru, Tom also rushed to Shina's side. At that moment, a low voice echoed in the collection area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, you guys have been here too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  voice  was  full  of  confidence  and  pride.  When  Nozomu  and  the  others  looked  in  the direction of the voice, they saw Kevin and his party of silver-ginned wolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A total of 20 students were there. Nozomu and his friends thought that they might have had some business to attend to at this gathering spot, but they changed their minds when they saw Kevin and his party in full gear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you guys doing here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm just here to check on the effects of that herd of Garm moving around. It was a very large herd. The guild is concerned that the territory of the monsters in the forest may be changing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The party members, mostly made up of beastmen, followed Kevin's lead as he stepped into the collection area and deployed a semi-surrounding force around Shina and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong with you, dead leaf ears?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calanti looks down at Shina, who is crouching down, and Nozomu's voice leaks out in anger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, she and Nozomu do not have a good relationship. But even so, the words came out of reflex in response to Calanti's unreservedly snide remarks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ara? The bottom trash is with you too? You two outcasts are so close."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Calanti ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, sir! What's it leader!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up for a second."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ye~yes ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-177"></a>At the sound of Kevin's voice, which was low and intimidating to those around him, Calanti, who was about to approach Shina, opened his eyes and stepped back as if frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  other  members  of  the  group,  unlike  usual,  looked  somewhat  upset  at  Kevin,  who  just looked down at Shina without saying a word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey,  get  the  hell  out  of  here.  It's  just  a  nuisance  to  have  someone  like  you  staying  in  this forest."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's words were as if to chase him away, and Mimuru's brow furrowed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would do that even if you didn't tell me! Tom ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U~un. Shina, come on."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No don't ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But escaping from their hands, which were trying to support her from both sides, Shina turned her attention to a corner of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ringing in her ears had become even louder, accompanied by a headache, and a powerful vision hit her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a black, four-legged beast that appeared quickly from the depths of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the red eyes of the demon beast caught Shina's, the vision she had been seeing burst forth at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's coming. ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean, "coming?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is coming? What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong chill ran down Kevin's spine. In the next instant, he reflexively flung himself into a full-body leap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woooooooooooooooooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment Kevin jumped away from the spot, with a roar that split the air, a powerful torrent of magical power shot out from the side and pierced the spot where Kevin was standing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin, Shina, and the others, who had quickly leapt into the air to dodge, traced the main source of the magical flow, and were stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a huge jet-black wolf. It had black fur and crimson eyes. The tail, which was almost as long as the body itself, was waving sharply like a saw, and the sharp canine teeth, reminiscent of swords, were bared as it glared at Shina and the others as if it were avenging them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The red eyes that glared at her brought back abominable memories for Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-178"></a>The  forest  engulfed  in  flames,  the  echoing  screams,  the  bloodied  parents,  the  sister  and  the spirits who urged her to flee and then vanished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You, you the one ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With her vision turning red with anger, Shina pulls out the bow on her back and, setting Tom's special engraved arrow in the quiver, she pours magic into the arrow without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blue-colored magical power poured into the arrow as if in a frenzy, and the engraving on the arrow began to emit a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Shina begins chanting. She concentrates the atmosphere around the arrow, wraps it around the arrow in a spiral, and releases it all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A fusion of strengthening magic and wind magic. The arrow, strengthened and far more robust than steel, receives the help of the tension of the bow, which is also strengthened, and wind magic, and plunges in a straight line toward the jet-black demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just before it pierces the space between its eyebrows,.......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gagin! and the fangs of the jet-black demonic beast bit down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demonic beast  gathered power like a black haze in its mouth to catch Shina's  engraved arrow, and bit down on it with a scrawny, counter-attacking engraved arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No way ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Shina is stunned by having her greatest attack crushed, Kevin moves next.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He concentrated his qi on his legs and fired a powerful shot. Kevin jumps into the bosom of the beast with his legs, and as he turns to the side of the beast, he strengthens his whole body with  qi,  and  then,  using  his  palms  as  waistband,  he  concentrates  his  qi  into  his  claws  and releases a blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps instinctively sensing the danger of the jet-black demonic beast, his complexion showed no sign of the playfulness he had shown so far.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A blow with all his might slams into the side of the jet-black beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu: Impale Claw Fang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A qijutsu that simultaneously strikes the opponent with the impact of the bottom of the hand and the burst of qi released from the thrusting claw.</p>
<p class="calibre1">ZUN! The sound of a heavy blow echoed. However, the jet-black beast bared its fangs, not even fists striking Kevin, which could shatter even a large rock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dodge!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin reacts to Nozomu's yell and leaps backward with a cluck of his tongue to retreat from the jet-black wolf fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-179"></a>At that moment, Kevin's eyes caught sight of a ring of red hairs on the neck of the jet-black beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The red hairs, reminiscent of a collar, brought the image of the beast back to Kevin's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this the Garm I failed to finish off before?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone, cover the leader!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ō! All right! I got it!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">To cover Kevin,  the members  of his  party, including Calanti,  all leap  at  the "gray"  that has turned into a jet-black demon beast. They aim at the limbs, the head, and the tail, which controls the beast's balance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, even if they miss the initial attack, they take advantage of their numbers, and each member of the team is in position to launch a second and third line of attack, and so on, in multiple attacks. Their skill and teamwork, which enabled them to set up such a siege formation in an instant, were without a doubt the best in the school year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Kevin, who was watching them, his face turning pale and white, exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu, don't!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, black violence erupted with a gust of wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic power erupted from the black tail of the raised "gray" and raged wildly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goooaaaah!" "kyaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a gust of wind, the magical blades scattered in all directions. The first members of Kevin's party who attempted to leap at him were injured one by one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it, everyone spread out! The second team used a time delay attack to distract the enemy's attention! Third team, rescue the wounded!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calanti and his group immediately tried to form up, but the second and third groups that tried to help them were also rained down by the "gray's" magical blades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had also heard from Irisdina that "Gray" had escaped with a fatal wound, and more importantly,  it  was  Nozomu  himself  who  first  detected  that  Garm  in  front  of  him  was wandering around Arcazam and was the one who triggered the request to defeat him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, from Kevin's mention of the name "Garm," I had been able to guess that the jet-black demon beast was the demon beast that his friends had engaged in battle with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crap!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  help  them  as  they  were  wounded,  Nozomu  and  Kevin  stepped  forward  to  try  to  get  the attention of "Gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Kevin who took the lead.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-180"></a>While activating qijutsu flash step, he also used his ability " Qi Lightning Transformation" in combination. He rushed forward with a tail-like thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Orraaaa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At speed, Kevin thrusts out his fist. His blow slammed into the head of the magical beast as if it was sucked in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the sound of exploding thunder could be heard. It was the technique that had inflicted a fatal wound on this demonic beast the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's blow, however, failed to inflict even a hair's breadth of injury on the hexenbiest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast bared its fangs and attacked him in front of the surprised Kevin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gagh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin  quickly  jumped  backwards  to  avoid  the  deadly  fangs,  but  his  face  showed  a  look  of uncontrollable agitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(It is clearly the most intimidating and magical power at the top of A rank. If it is bad enough, it can even reach an S-rank ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from Nozomu's eyes, the demon beast in front of him had undergone a transformation that was clearly different from that of an ordinary Garm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The killing intent and intimidation emanating from the jet-black demonic beast's entire body, Nozomu's keen senses sounded a warning bell that could not be more alarming If they leave this demonic beast unattended, they will be in serious trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Koo~o~o~o ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray," which had been scattering its magical blades in all directions, opened its mouth and began to gather magical power in its oral cavity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The air trembled and the trees screamed as if frightened by the increasing magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the magical power that had reached a critical point was released all at once with the roar of the magical beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woooooooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~tsu"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The target was Calanti, who was practically in charge of Kevin's party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was lending a shoulder to a wounded comrade when a stream of "gray" magic attacked her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh~tsu, ōho ōho!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin howled at the threat to his companions. With all his might, he intervened between Calanti and his companions, crossing his arms and catching the "gray" magic stream from the front.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-181"></a>Qijutsu/Steel Body Technique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  defensive  qijutsu  that  uses  qijutsu  to  strengthen  the  entire  body  and  catch  an opponent's attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin is one of the most talented students in his grade, and his Steel Body Technique, which reaches the rank of "A", took the "Gray" magic flow head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gugu ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the cost was great. The arm he was holding up like a shield was shredded, and his entire body  was  covered  in  countless  wounds.  He  was  bleeding  profusely  and  was  clearly  in  no condition to fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bad, this is bad! That guy has become far more dangerous than before. We have to get out of here now!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru shouted for retreat as they had kicked out Kevin, who was a higher-ranked man than they were.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the "gray" was now far beyond their reach.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I, I get it. Leader ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of the wounded Kevin, Calanti agrees to withdraw.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"All right, then, immediately ......, Shina, what the hell are you doing!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just as Mimuru was about to retreat, a startling sight caught her attention. The first thing he saw was Shina pointing an arrow at that extremely dangerous demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Avenge Nēe-san, Razward's, everyone's ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A black demon beast with red eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has the same characteristics as the demon beast that she encountered as a young child in the burning Nebula forest, which was her sworn vengeance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes filled with anger, and Mimuru's voice did not reach her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  arrows  on  the  bow  were  clearly  overloaded  with  magic  power,  and  the  shafts  with  the magic formula on them were starting to crack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Shina didn't care, she continued to pour magic power into the arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The screams of the past stuck in the back of her ears, and her eyes were clouded with hatred.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Avenge? Could it be...at the time of the Great Invasion ......gu~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  eyes  widened  at  the mention  of Shina's  words  Meanwhile, Nozomu's  eyes widen involuntarily when he hears Shina's words "avenge everyone," but his thoughts are interrupted by a sudden gust of wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's arrow was released.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic arrow, blue wing's comet star, was released.</p>
<p class="softbreak">&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/yNntjcB/000003.jpg" alt="000003" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-183"></a>The arrow, filled with magic power with all its might without thinking of the consequences, makes the arrowhead become red-hot, and with a spiraling wind, it flies toward the magical beast as if it were a comet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the "gray" flashed its tail as it watched Shina's arrow approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" flashed its tail as it looked at Shina's arrow coming at it, and with the countless magic blades it released, it easily shattered Shina's magical arrow with its long, powerful blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic blades that cut through the magic arrow were baring their fangs at Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  magic  blade  that  sliced  through  the  magic  manipulation  engraved  arrow  bore  its  fangs directly at Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was stunned by the approaching magic blade, but Nozomu and Tom moved in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come out, Golem!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu activated his flash step and pushed her to the ground, while Tom created a golem to shield them both.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's  golem  was  instantly  cut  to  pieces  by the "gray" magic blade, but  Nozomu  and Shina were able to evade it in the nick of time. The sand and soil rained down on Nozomu and Shina, who were lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, one of the magical blades that shredded the golem caught Tom's body, which had become defenseless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a scream, fresh blood danced in the air. Tom's body was hit by the magical blade and his body was blown away, slamming into a tree behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, hold on! There's blood, blood ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miml pales at the threat of her lover.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" magic blade landed on Tom's body as if it to slice him in half. It easily sliced through his school uniform, which was supposed to be made for combat, and deeply wounded his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was  bleeding badly.  Mimuru rushed to  Tom's wound and tried to stop  the bleeding, but blood was pouring out from the gap between her palms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ahhh ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Nozomu's arms, Shina lets out a trembling voice in front of Tom's fallen figure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her pupils dilated and her whole body trembled as she remembered the last of her family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kuh! Hey, hold it up!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-184"></a>Shina was stunned by the memory of the trauma, but her voice was out of earshot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't feel bad ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah~, ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pan! A dry sound echoed. The pain in her cheek brought a slight light back into Shina's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen, there's a hut just north of here where you can get medical treatment. I'll buy you some time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh.....?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who slapped Shina on the cheek to bring her back to consciousness, stood up quickly and stared at the "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no time to hesitate. If they don't act immediately, everyone here will die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, it is close to Shino's hut. There is a certain amount of medicine available, and there should be enough time to use recovery magic. Nozomu raises his voice to Kevin and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You too! If you don't want to die, go north!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking ...... about? How can you, a bottom-feeder, hold back that demon beast</p>
<p class="calibre1">......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin says something, but Nozomu listens without question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He draws his sword and is about to step in when the hem of his uniform is pulled with unreliable force.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wa~it ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned around to see Shina, who was looking at him with eyes that clung to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... leave me, don't leave me. Nee-san."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly she was not looking at Nozomu. She was looking at someone who was not here. The fragile and brokenness that exposed makes Nozomu feel as if her hair is being pulled back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there was no time to lose. The "gray" raised its saw-like tail and began to gather magic power with a roar. He must be planning to rain down those magic blades again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin! Take care of Shina and the others!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gulped, shook off Shina who was clinging to him, and activated his flash step. The next moment, countless magic blades rained down on him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sends his ki into the sword and draws it out while imparting an ultra-thin blade of ki to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fu~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sends qi into the sword and draws it out while imparting an extremely ultra thin qi-blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-185"></a>At the same time, he activates his flash step. The blades that hit Shina and the others behind her were cut to pieces and dissipated, as if making a run through the gaps between the magical blades that were falling on them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing! Get the hell out of here!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, while shouting Kevin and the others, who let out a cry of surprise, ran to close the gap with the "Gray.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(As expected, the "gray" magical blade is only forcibly holding the magic together. If you slice through it even a little, it will dissipate from the point where you slice through it!) Originally, the power of magic is vague as it is, and it dissipates quickly. For this reason, people can give a clear direction to the magical power by means of a technique or ritual, but no such technique is applied to the magical blade of "Gray," which is a demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the magic blade, which is only forcibly hardened, has a certain fragility inherent in it, despite its size and the magic power contained in it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu, who had exploited the flaw of the gray blade, closed the gap between the two, the gray tried to tear Nozomu's body apart with its own fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the huge mouth that looms over him, he twists his body again and changes his course.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He runs past the approaching fangs, dodging as close as he can, and quickly flashes his blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gugyauuuu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" screamed in agony as it was slashed at the base of its right foreleg. The crimson eyes turned to Nozomu with even more fierceness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yosh, just keep following me!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, having succeeded in turning the attention back to himself, runs directly behind the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gray" and dives into the bushes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Guuuoooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray," enraged by his wounds, begins to chase after Nozomu with a roar of rage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then began a deadly escape.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, hah, hah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The roar shakes the atmosphere, and the footsteps of the huge demonic beast running shakes even the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been more than ten minutes since Nozomu attracted the demon beast as a decoy, and his escape from the beast is still going on in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-186"></a>Considering the difference in ability between him and the beast, he would have been caught up with and killed immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the reasons he was able to escape was because of the geographical advantage Nozomu had.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The forest where he was forced to run around a lot by Shino as part of his training. It was a place where he was often attacked by demonic beasts and had to flee for his life. Nozomu knew this place better than the Hunters and the students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu chose a place in the forest where the trees were short and had grown to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance between the trees was narrow, and the "gray", which had become bloated and had a  huge  physique,  was  unable  to  catch  up  with  the  monster  because  of  its  size,  which  was obstructed by the thick growth of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu was also unable to completely shake off the demonic beast, and the distance between the two remained almost the same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was clearly Nozomu who was at a disadvantage in the situation as it was.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(We are almost through the place. Still need to make up the distance to keep those girls safe though. Can they make it to ...... in time?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">He glanced back and saw a jet-black demonic beast, still chasing him with its huge mouth fully open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Damn! It won't give up on me, huh!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">When wolves pursue their prey, they keep up the chase for hours. Of course, they would not give up easily yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, Nozomu himself didn't think he could keep running for such a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... Have to do it, huh?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is determined and changes the direction in which he runs. He must take a sure-fire way to defeat the demonic beast behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He thinks of releasing the ability suppression. In his mind, the nightmare after the release at the Francilt mansion comes back to his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is anxiety. However, if he continues as he is, he will surely be killed by the demonic beast behind him. If this was the case, there was no choice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon the flat ground was cut off and a steep downhill came into view.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu ran down the hill as fast as he could.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If he stepped off his foot and fell, he would roll in a straight line down to the bottom, and he would not escape serious injury. However, he could not slow down now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" was also coming down the hill, trying to catch up with Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance between Nozomu and the "Gray" was getting closer and closer, and at last it was right behind Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-187"></a>The gray opens its jaws wide. Its huge mouth, which opened to the left and right, was stained bright red, and its countless fangs made a gnashing sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  just  as  the  beast's  jaws  almost  caught  Nozomu,  ......  Nozomu's  figure  suddenly disappeared from the beast's view.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A few moments later, the "Gray"'s left foreleg is hit by a sharp pain, and fresh blood sprays out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray" suddenly loses his balance and tries to regain his stance, but he is unable to stand on one leg and falls to the ground, rolling down the slope as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu~tsu ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who thought the demonic beast had caught him, had escaped to the side of the beast before he knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the fangs of the demonic beast caught him, he changed the direction in which he was running with his flash step curved style. While running to the side, he slashed at the left front leg of the "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">No creature can escape from gravity. When descending a slope, the weight of a quadruped is concentrated on its front legs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  "Gray"  had  its  front  leg  injured,  it  could  not  control  its  own  weight  and  the momentum of its run down the hill, and it rolled down the slope.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, ha, ha ...... haaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu grabbed the invisible chains that bound him and ripped them off with all his might.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  shattered  chains  fly  through  the  air,  and  the  vast  amount  of  qi  that  is  released  pulls  up Nozomu's abilities at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sheathed the sword he had drawn, and then he struck with all his might to compress the qi to the extreme. At the same time, he activates his flash step and charges toward the "gray"</p>
<p class="calibre1">that has tumbled down the slope.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" that has raised itself at the bottom of the hill opens its oral cavity toward Nozomu, who jumps at it from above.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The enormous amount of magic power that is being concentrated. Then, the magical power that had reached a critical point was released with the roar of the "Gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woooooooooooooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  torrent  of  magic  power  is  expelled.  Faced  with  the  stream  of  magic  power  coming  in  a straight line, Nozomu also opens his scabbard mouth and pulls out his blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu - Phantom Blade.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-188"></a>The extremely thin qi-blade released slashes through the "gray" magic flow and cuts off the beast's lower jaw.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahyu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The launching pad collapsed, and the unstable magic flow instantly dissipated. Then, Nozomu returned the favor and fired a side slash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The qijutsu phantom, released again, cuts the body of the "Gray" in two, creating a huge scar on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The body of the "Gray" slowly collapses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahahaha, fu......ggughhhh."</p>
<p class="calibre1">When he landed on the ground, Nozomu breathed heavily and looked down at his arms, which were in pain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking closely, he saw that the skin on both arms was torn, and blood was dripping down the arms. It was a reaction to the release of his power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, he felt a strong sense of fatigue and laziness throughout his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was glad, but now I have to go to ..."</p>
</div>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-0">
<p class="calibre1">It was defeated. Nozomu was relieved and tried to reapply the ability suppression to himself again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, however, he hears the deafening roar of the beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrrrr ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're kidding……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a "gray" that was coming back to life. The wounds cut by phantom blade are clinging to the wounds and are gradually closing them up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The "Gray" was absorbing the qi of the technique I had released. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The jet-black beast regenerates the wounds with a pulsating sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, particles of black light began to dance from the "gray" black body hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The particles of light were similar to the ones that Tiamat was covered in, which Nozomu had seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The light of the source element ....... But why ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'gray', having closed the wound, leaps at Nozomu with only his upper body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu reflexively slammed all his qi into his right hand, and his arm hit the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-189"></a>Qijutsu, Annihilation Light</p>
<p class="calibre1">A torrent of qi erupted from the ground, enveloping Nozomu and the "gray" and bursting forth, It burst into flames, engulfing the surrounding trees and blasting away everything in its path with a roaring sound.</p>
