<h3>Chapter 7: Shining Light In The Shadows</h3>

<p class="calibre1">Shina and the others, who had been walking through the forest, eventually arrived at Shino's hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The structure of Shino's hut is different from that of ordinary houses on the Arkmill continent, in part because the original owner was from the Far East.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The entrance is spacious, with a water gage on the bare ground and a hearth next to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The interior is simple, with a hearth in the center of a wooden-walled room and a small chest of drawers at the end of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, they were surprised that there was a hut deep in the forest where people could live.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, since there were many injured people, they put the injured to sleep and began treatment immediately after they entered the hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who could use recovery magic gave priority to those who were seriously injured, while the others went to help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin was also receiving treatment from Calanti, but his expression was still not good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru laid the injured Tom down in the shino hut, took medicine and healing tools from the shelf, and began to treat him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He washed the wound, sewed it with thread, sprinkled potions on it, and bandaged it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bleeding was under control, but Tom was still breathing heavily and his forehead was covered in greasy sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..............."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, on the other hand, was casting a healing spell on Tom, but was somewhat preoccupied, as if she was worried about Nozomu, who had just made a silly mistake and had to take care of the aftermath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was not fully concentrating, and the healing light overflowing from her hands was not stable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, concentrate properly ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was rebuked by Mimuru and hurriedly refocused on her magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's voice was somewhat hard and cold, as if Mimuru was also preoccupied with her lover's wounds. Obviously, she does not have enough time to spare either.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, Tom's expression, which had been suffering from rough breathing, began to soften.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......I think he's okay, for now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-190"></a>Even though they had finished treating him, Tom's injuries were so deep and there was so much blood that had flowed, he fell asleep almost as soon as the pain subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Tom has been patched up once more, the two sit down to rest, but they are silent, unable to say anything to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina is staring at the floor, shoulders slumped, perhaps concerned about her earlier mistake, and her hands, folded in her lap, are clasped tightly together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina is clutching her hands tightly folded in her lap</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's hands are moving restlessly, as if she too is restless, and her eyes are not leaving Tom, who is asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An awkward atmosphere pervades the room, but there is nothing they can say that will blow the air out of the room, only silence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Hey, Shina. Why didn't you try to run away then?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, Miml broke the silence and asked Shina about her earlier behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, Mimuru broke the silence and asked Shina about her earlier behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No matter how you look at it, that monster was crazy. You knew right away that we couldn't handle such a beast. Why did you try to do something reckless?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's tone is strong as she questions Shina. Driven by the anger that wells up in her, her words gradually turn into denunciations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, too, is at a loss for words under Mimuru's angry gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you had just done what you were supposed to do at that time, there would have been no need for Nozomu to do anything reckless. Tom wouldn't have had to get hurt!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"............"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina looked down, unable to say anything at Mimuru's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the current situation, Mimuru's questioning and one-sided denunciation of Shina at this moment was not a praiseworthy action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though they were able to escape from the "gray," their safety was only temporary. The black beast was not the only demon beast in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Asking Shina why she didn't try to escape, or even unilaterally accusing her, could cause a complete split in the party.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mimuru, too, was mentally trapped after her boyfriend Tom was seriously injured, and as a result, she was taking it out on Shina, who had created this situation. The fact that she was able to escape to a safe place for the time being caused her tense feelings to break down, and the fact that Shina was downcast without saying anything in response to her questions also added to her anger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You ...... say something!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-191"></a>Mimuru's voice gradually gets louder as she denounces Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru grabs onto Shina, but Shina just squeezes her eyes shut and bites her lip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's patience with the silent Shina has reached its limit. Shina's silence made Mimuru's patience run out, and he raised his hand to slap her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's enough,"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru was stopped by Kevin, who was being treated by Calanti.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His body, which had received the "gray" magic flow with his entire body, suffered burns and scalds in various directions, but fortunately, he was not seriously injured.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, perhaps because he exerted all his energy to protect his friends, there is a deep color of fatigue on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the wounds can be erased by recovery magic, they cannot be completely healed. Even so, it was imperative that the bears regain their footing, even if only a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what is that demon beast? No matter how you look at it, it's way out of our hands."</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the scale of threat level of demonic beasts, it is an existence that could reach the rank of S. A demonic beast of that caliber does not often appear in this spasim forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is because such powerful demonic beasts generally have their own proper territory and rarely come out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Maybe the direwolf we defeated. That's it’s the leader."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew it. We didn't even check on it when it dying ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin put his hand over his mouth as he thought about what Shina had just muttered. The actuality is that there are only a few werewolf-type magical beasts around that boast of such a large physique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what do you know about that demon beast?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was clearly showing that she knew that jet-black demon beast. The gazes of those present were drawn to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It looked like ...... that one. It looked like one of the demonic beasts that destroyed the Nebula forest."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina began to speak fluently in response to the questioning gaze. Her voice trembled like that of a frightened child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I felt it when the beast glared at me. I felt as if countless spirits were screaming in my ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You were supposed to have lost your connection with the spirits."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That ...... is still true today. I lost the power of the spirits when that monster took my home away from me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">She lost her family, her connection to the spirits, everything.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-192"></a>"I lost everything. My family, my dearest friends, everything. That's why ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">So, at least, she wanted to get revenge for that. Mimuru became furious at those words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of that, Tom was badly wounded!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's wounds are the heaviest of all the injured.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the reason for his recklessness did not calm Mimuru's temper. Rather, because of what she heard, the waves of emotion become more violent and stormy. With a little force, the taut threads</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking violently, Mimuru, who had lost his composure, now took out all his negative feelings on Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can fight all you want, but right now I can't afford it. We have to get these guys back to town as soon as possible in the morning. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin waits for Mimuru.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He stood up with his bandaged arm around his head and looked up at the night sky peeking through the small window of the hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun was already setting. The forest is not easy enough to carry a large number of wounded people, no matter how good the beasts are with their physical and sensory abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, he is ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry ......, but right now we've got our hands full with these wounded guys."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking over at his companions, who were groaning in pain from their wounds, Kevin let out a sigh of self-mockery and slumped his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The actual fact that Nozomu alone became a decoy to attract the attention of the beast was a big shadow in their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's pathetic. Laugh it up. You've been calling me a dead leaf, but when the time comes, you're just like this."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin is not one to sit cross-legged on his talents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he is able to maintain the largest party in the third grade is proof of this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the end, nothing could be done. A sense of helplessness filled him, and Kevin unknowingly clenched his fists tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that bottom ......, no, Nozomu Bountis, how does he know about this hut? This place was obviously used until recently, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There were grave in the back. I wonder if maybe someone related to him lived there ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because of the mention of Nozomu, Kevin and the others finally begin to voice their doubts about the gap that Nozomu has here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, however, the beastman's superior hearing caught the sound of rustling and raking grass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the sound of footsteps approaching toward this hut in a heap.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-193"></a>The image of that black demon beast flashed in the minds of everyone in the hut, and tension ran through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina readied her bow, which was by her side, and Mimuru drew the dagger from her waist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin, clenching his fists, stepped forward to protect and shield Calanti and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, with a clatter, the hut door swung open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin and Mimuru are hunched over, ready to pounce, and Shina draws her bow, ready to fire an arrow at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the door rattled open. There was something in human form, its entire body covered in mud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U e e…… What the~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Te ē rya ā!" "U ō ō!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina shot an arrow from her belt at the humanoid's brow, and Mimuru and Kevin leapt at it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The humanoid seemed to be saying something, but Mimuru and Kevin's yells and screams were so loud that the others could not hear it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaahhh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a cry and a body language that did not suggest the human form was made of mud, he turned his head away and dodged Shina's oncoming arrow, but this time Mimuru and Kevin stepped in and drew their daggers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, wa~wait ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The humanoid deflected the blade of an approaching dagger by striking it with something stick-like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru was surprised that her attack was parried, but Kevin took advantage of the opportunity to thrust his fist at the humanoid's face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, stop it!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The humanoid steps forward and avoids Kevin's fist strike while fighting off the fist with his left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The three finally stopped moving at the sound of a familiar voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon closer inspection, the figure was a human covered in mud, and it was the same person who had served as a decoy to help Shina and the others escape just a moment before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, that's me. It's me! Why am I suddenly being attacked by my fellow as well!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-194"></a>Even though Shina and the others had no bad intentions, anyone would raise their voice if they were welcomed with arrows, swords, and fists with the intent to kill after finally joining up with them as a decoy to get everyone out of there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, I'm sorry ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Nozomu."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That ......, I'm sorry ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, well, that's okay ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, Nozomu himself, in retrospect of his current muddy appearance, recalled that it was not a good idea to have a weapon pointed at him, and he calmed his anger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why was Nozomu so covered in mud at ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, Mimuru asks Nozomu about the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After I shook off that black demon beast, I was chased by another demon beast the next time I went out here. I pushed it against a bunch of goblins I met along the way, but ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was blown away by the aftermath of the qijutsu "Annihilation Light," but encountered the demonic beasts that had gathered after hearing the commotion. he had to play a big game of run again in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, it was the Einherjar Horse Spider that chased him. It is a wandering, roaming, spider-like demonic beast that builds its nest in the soil and roams the ground in search of food. Its rank, indicating its threat level, is B.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its body is larger than a horse, and as its name suggests, it is named after the fact that it will eat even large animals like horses. It is an extremely dangerous demon beast with a strong outer skin, sharp fangs, and even has poison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, goblins are demonic beasts with green skin and a physique as large as a human child. Their threat level is E.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason why they are categorized as a demonic beast despite having a body similar to that of humans is because they are a race of looters and cannibals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the past, communication with them was attempted several times by different means, but since they were unable to have a proper conversation in the first place and repeatedly attacked those who tried to negotiate with them, they are now treated the same as demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even after I escaped, I couldn't stand it if other demon beasts chased me again based on my smell, so I dropped my scent at a nearby watering hole and covered myself with mud."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the Spasim forest is thick with trees, there are many demon beasts that rely on scent to find their prey. Wild dogs, mud bears, direwolves, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> are probably the best examples of animals that rely on scent to find their prey.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, Einherjar Horse Spiders also have a sense of scent, but they rely more on hearing, touch, and sight, using air vibrations to locate their prey.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-195"></a>Nozomu draws water from the cistern at the entrance of the hut and covers his head with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as the mud that had coated his entire body fell off, he felt a sharp pain in his right arm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~Tsu......! "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That injury ..... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I got a little ...... wound when I was fighting that black demon beast ...... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's right arm, exposed by the falling mud, had numerous lacerations. The lacerations on his right arm were caused by the reaction to the "annihilation light" he used after releasing the suppression of his abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(When I used it at the Francilt mansion, I didn't get this badly wounded ......) The reason is that he used it on the spur of the moment, which caused him to lose control of his qi slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He rubbed mud all over his body to cover the wound so as not to spread the smell of blood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu took out a potion he had with him to patch him up for the time being. Then, Shina gently took his hand in hers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Sit down, I'll treat you ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I'll do it myself. I'm fine ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll take care of it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sat down on the board, pushed by Shina's strong tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming that he had sat down, Shina sprinkled the potion she had taken from him and began to wrap a bandage around him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her expression is still somewhat gloomy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only sound was the shuffle and scrape of the bandage between the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other members of the group remained silent, watching Nozomu being treated with somewhat awkward expressions on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How is Tom's condition?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's all treated up and sleeping now, but I still think we should get back to town as soon as possible."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, right ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The conversation does not continue. Nozomu looks at Mimuru as if asking for help, but she glares at Shina and turns away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin shakes his body uncomfortably for some reason, and his party members also look away with a difficult expression on their faces when they meet Nozomu's gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilted his head at the unnatural reaction of those around him.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-196"></a>"Hey, what's going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean by ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that's ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm done. I'll be watching outside, so if you need me, just call me at ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tries to ask about the delicate atmosphere inside the hut, but when Shina finishes treating him, she walks out without answering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu has no choice but to call out to Mimuru, who is closest to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, what's going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. I don't know anything about Shina ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, too, does not make eye contact with Nozomu, and her mouth twitches in a teasing manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sighs heavily at the sight of the two of them and pulls out a large pot from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course, make a meal. In a situation like this, if you don't eat when you can, your body won't be able to take it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil over the fire. While the water boils, make a simple soup by scraping dried meat that has been stored in the shed with a knife to remove the broth, and add potatoes and other ingredients.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the soup comes to a boil, season it with rock salt and pour it into a bowl. Since there were only a limited number of bowls, we had to take turns eating the soup, and the pot was small, so we had to divide the soup into several portions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can't really vouch for the taste ......, but it will warm you up. I left some for Tom, so if he can get up and eat it, let him."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru accepts the bowl Nozomu offers, but she stares at the bowl in her hand with a complicated look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh, yeah, I'm fine! Don't worry about it ...... thanks."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru immediately smiles, but even the perceptive Nozomu can tell that she' s overreacting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, for now, divided the soup for the three of them and took the rest to Kevin and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, thank you ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry. Thanks for your help."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No problem, it's just the way things are. It's a win-win situation."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-197"></a>Kevin hands the bowl and pot he received to Karanti, and she begins to go around giving each of the wounded a bowl of soup.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, I heard that those demon beasts also appeared in the Nebula Forest during the Great Invasion."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, that's what that elf said. I have no idea why, but ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did Shina-san say something to you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, she said something about hearing the screams of countless spirits in her ear ...... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The spirits, screams ....... But she ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right, she shouldn't be able to hear the spirits. The fact that the demonic beasts that Irisdina and her party were supposed to have defeated looked a lot like the demonic beasts of the Nebula Forest, which shouldn't be in this forest, is also a story that I don't understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not up to the students anymore ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, It's a problem for the whole of Arcazam. No, I hope that's all it's going to take.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, as soon as I can move, I've got to get back to Arcazam ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying this, Kevin gulped down the soup in the bowl he was given in one gulp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Somthing wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I'm just thinking you're an awesome guy."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was amused by Kevin's sudden words of admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm in this mess, but you managed to escape from that guy with only an injured right hand, didn't you? What's up with the bottom feeder thing is? The school's grading system is also lousy ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is struck with an indescribable feeling as Kevin looks down at his bandaged body and smiles to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, your injuries were sustained while defending your fellow companions, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Kevin's injuries were sustained in defense of his fellow party. He should be proud of that, but it is not something to be mocked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But, to Nozomu's words, Kevin's smile deepened and he muttered to himself in dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? You're the same way, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">From Kevin's point of view, Nozomu's action was to help not only his own friends but also the rest of the party, and the result was far superior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu had a look of surprise on his face at Kevin's words, and Kevin's eyes twinkled as he saw his unexpected reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-198"></a>"Hmmm, wrong? You and Shina and the others, weren't you two teaming up together in the forest today?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, we just happened to meet at that collecting site ..... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see ..... I thought you were a fool when I heard rumors about your freshman year, but you're a fool in another way."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean .....?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilts his head at Kevin's implied line.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it means Irisdina had a good eye."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin smiles meaningfully and points to the bowl of soup that Nozomu was serving.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyway, take that soup to that elf."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yeah. Then Mimuru can take it to ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, but Nozomu can take that soup over to her. Maybe if I over it, she won't be able to stand it and we'll get into a fight. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru asked Nozomu to do so with a shadowed expression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..... Got it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Mimuru behind once he turned away, Nozomu took the remaining bowl of soup and walked out of the hut.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was sitting on the roof of her hut, holding her knees. She said she was keeping watch, but she was far from being able to do that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All that went through her head was frustration and regret.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When her hometown, Nebula Forest, fell in the great invasion, that black demonic beast appeared before her stunned eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its appearance was different from the one that appeared today, but there was no mistaking the black sludge that covered its entire body and its countless blood-red eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What was most terrifying of all was the presence that surrounded the demonic beast. While it radiated a horrifying presence, behind it, Shina could see the presence of spirits she knew well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was precisely because there was a familiar presence that the beast's horror seemed even more pronounced to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sheer horror and inescapable sense of death coldly bound her mind and body like iron chains. Her parents, her sister, and a small spirit who could be said to be her half-body, rescued her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-199"></a>"Don't worry, you will survive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The last of her family, recalled over and over again with nightmares. She didn't want to escape alone. She wanted them to run away together. Shina knew that fighting would be futile once the big tree had been taken down,</p>
<p class="calibre1">But neither her parents nor her sister would listen to her pleas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina continued to run away with her sister at her back as her father and mother screamed at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the presence of death soon caught up with them. The presence of a demon beast approaching from behind made Shina's sister, who had been pulling her hand, stop and let go of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have to run away from here alone."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her sister tapped her on the shoulder as if to tell her, and she looked back at her with eyes that held the same resolve as her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone, Razward, take care of my sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in response to her words, the light that has gathered takes the form of a small lapis lazuli-colored bird.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A spirit who had contracted with Shina, a powerful being who could take a definite form. The spirit that had contracted with her sister, who was a high elf, had long since been killed along with the spirit of the great tree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The little lapis lazuli-colored bird called Razward begins to glow as it circles around Shina, enveloping her in a cocoon of light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The supernatural power that surrounds her and the will of the spirit that she can sense in it clearly tells her what her sister and best friend are trying to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was not ready to lose her parents, and even more so, her sister and half of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Get me out of here and save both of us, she pleaded. Her pleas were in vain, and with the last of her sister's strength, she was sent flying out of the forest of Nebula.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her home forest was shrouded in mist, but now smoke rose from everywhere, and the place where the great tree once stood was shrouded in black mist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Giiiiiiiii! "</p>
<p class="calibre1">The scream of the spirit echoed in the mind. Then, the remaining cocoon of light was drowned out like a burst of bullets. It was the final scream of the little lapis lazuli bird that Shina had contracted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The scream of the little bird clearly reminded the young Shina of what had happened to the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaahhhh......aaaahhhh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-200"></a>Shina collapsed, holding her face with both hands. She scratched her skin, trying to convince herself that the unacceptable reality was a lie. Then, with an inarticulate scream, she lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From that day on, Shina lost her connection with the spirits, and her childhood friend disappeared, never to appear before her again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The surviving Shina wandered with her remaining friends. She had no choice but to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But at the time, the countries that had suffered the great invasion were exhausted, and moreover, the elves had ignored warnings just before the Nebula Forest was fallen, so the other races were very winded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Go back to their own homeland, which has turned into hell. There is nothing for the elves to eat. Such words were directed at them wherever they went. Shina and the other refugees had no place to stay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The elves were tormented by hunger and cold, but a turning point came.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Operation Fructus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The greatest human campaign against the invading demonic beasts. The remaining elves joined in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the sake of their remaining family members, and for the sake of their families, they fought hard and with much sacrifice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, the elves were allowed to live in the Sumahya Union, a new country created by those who lost their homeland. However, Operation Fructus was postponed indefinitely before the Nebula Forest due to the exhaustion of the nations, and the separation against the elves could not be dispelled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(That's why I came here. To change the weak me of twenty years ago. To reclaim my home again this time. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina lost her spirit magic, but instead honed her archery skills and learned the magic used by humans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring the opposing opinions, she trains desperately and manages to stay in the upper ranks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The effort is genuine and the feeling is definitely sincere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, they have not forgotten to bring back the spirit magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Still, when push came to shove, I couldn't do anything about it. ......) Due to frustration and pettiness, she squeezes her arms that had been clutching her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of depression just keeps getting worse and worse, but the anger towards herself just keeps swirling around in the back of her chest. Frankly speaking, it felt like her heart was about to fall apart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Don't worry, it's okay, it'll go away. I'll try not to feel it. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-201"></a>Anyway, now I wanted to be alone. And yet .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah goodness, I couldn't see you around the hut, so I wondered where you'd gone, and there you were on the roof. "</p>
<p class="calibre1">The person Shina most didn't want to see called out to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing? Here in a place like this ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina turned away from Nozomu's question and pressed on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I made a simple soup. I made a simple soup in case you're interested ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sits next to Shina, a body's length away from her, and offers her a bowl of steaming soup, but she doesn't even look at the bowl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want to ask you something ...... "</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why did you take the decoy yourself?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilts his head at the unexpected question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why, there was no one else who could have done it, and there was no other way ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, no one was in any condition to fight at that time. To escape, you need a ton stamina, and the only one who seemed to be able to do that was Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There was no one else? I could have been the one to stay! Since I was the cause, it makes more sense for me to stay!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's words were impossibly righteous, but they conversely caused Shina to become agitated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even she understands this with her rational mind. She knows that she cannot even stop it by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Negative emotions erupted violently. Above all, the fact that she herself had caused the crisis completely severed the threads in her heart that had been holding her back all her life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're in the tenth grade, you know! There is no way you can escape! Why would you do such a thing if you knew you were going to die!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, look, I'm alive like this, and I'm ......, hey!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, her eyes hanging up, grabs Nozomu by the bosom and brings her face so close to his that her breath catches in his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is startled by Shina's sudden action, but he notices the boulder-like tears in her eyes and is unable to say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! Surely you're not like me, who couldn't do anything! They said you were the weakest in your grade, but you were actually strong! But that beast is even more dangerous than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why are you being so reckless!"</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-203"></a>Shina's incoherent words and actions are the result of the trauma she has experienced at the hands of Nozomu, who served as her lord.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu was blinded by the dark emotions behind Shina's furious eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's incoherent words and actions were the result of the trauma she had experienced at the hands of Nozomu, who had served as her savior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the color of disappointment in herself and resignation that begins to spread through her tautened heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why, why ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She turns her head and continues to mutter with tears in her eyes. She doesn't know to whom these words are directed.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Gray", whose body had been cut off by Nozomu and blown away by Annihilation Light, crawled on the ground with only its upper body to reach the spot with its consciousness in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A tributary flowing into the Vein River. At the riverbank. The place where the family was buried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the freshly dug up soil, "Gray" lays there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sludge-like blood leaking from its body seeps into the ground, as if its life is spilling out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kurururu……</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" cried in a calm voice, his whole body stained with the blood that was flowing out of the body. It was as if it was relieved to be able to sleep in the place where its family slept.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The red eyes that had been stained red returned to normal before anyone knew it, and the body was rapidly losing its strength.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Already the body was as good as a corpse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The heart had been crushed to begin with. On top of that, the body had now been cut in half.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It' s not long now. No more movement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a war of survival to gain new territory. Above all, it was a battle to avenge the deaths of the family, but it ended in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hatred that already disappears from life, and the instinct to live. What comes instead is regret and relief at the verge of death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gray" had already realized how death had come . The reason why did it come to this riverbank was because it wanted to end up at least at the place where the family was laid to rest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wet with its own blood, it slowly closes its eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-204"></a>However, the "existence" that had assimilated into the body of the dying body would not allow the "gray" to die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, the ground soaked with the blood of the "Gray" rises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What appeared was the family of "Gray" and the already dead direwolves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kyuuu, kuuu……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "gray" was surprised to see the family members suddenly resurrected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the revived direwolves were clearly clad in a different air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their eyes, like those of the "gray" before them, are tinted red. The gaze they turned on their former leader was vacant to the point of emptiness, not something they would ever turn on one of their own people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrr ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes of a family member who has died. The "gray" growls as he realizes the "existence"</p>
<p class="calibre1">lurking in the depths of their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That "existence" is what kept "gray" alive when it was supposed to die.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "existence" looks with hatred at the "gray" who can no longer fight ...... and has given up the will to fight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Then, i don't need it anymore. Take the food."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The declaration echoed in the mind of "Gray. The next moment, the revived direwolves surrounded the "Gray" and began to pierce the "Gray" with their fangs one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyau, guuuu, giuuuuu……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The grunts of the "gray" with intense pain flowed in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The direwolves bite into the "Gray," and while they are eating away at the "Gray," their heads dive into the "Gray's" body, shredding its flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The body of the direwolf melts, and only the red eyes are twisted into the body of the "gray".</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this, the body of the "gray" also changes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lower half of his body, which had been severed by Nozomu, begins to regenerate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The flesh on the severed surface rises, and a reddish-black muscle-bare hind leg is formed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vertebral arch of the spine elongates sharply like a sword, and the tailbone splits and enlarges. The tailbone splits and becomes enlarged, transforming into three gigantic tails.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, the mandible, which had been severed by Nozomu's phantom, regenerates as the biting direwolves fuse together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When all the direwolves fused together, the consciousness of the "gray" disappeared completely, and there was a deformed beast with countless red eyes all over its body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Vuooooooo~o~o~o!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-205"></a>The roar echoed through the forest of Spasim, as if it were a series of voices.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The deformed beast rushed out into the forest, scattering a thick, black light of the source element, as if its entire body was a mess of paints.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead of them was the hut in Shino where Nozomu and the others were taking shelter.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina continued to cry, but eventually calmed down and quickly let herself go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry for ......I said a lot of strange things."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, well. It' s fine ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">They continue to sit on the roof of the hut, looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a subtle distance between the two of them, neither leaning in close nor pushing away, but rather the distance of a single person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind of silence was flowing through the gap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks. For listening to my complaints, without saying a word ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence was broken by a word of thanks. Nozomu was perplexed by these words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not like I did anything ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, of course not. You let us escape from that demon beast. You even cooked meal for us, taking care of our bodies. On top of that, you listened to my dirty whining without saying a word."</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....There's no such thing as dirty, is there? Everyone has times when their heart sinks ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina smiles, although it leaves her somewhat tired. But Nozomu could see that the smile was only superficial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the expression of someone trying desperately to hide a weight that their was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same mask that Nozomu himself still cannot remove.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A false smile, a look of resignation and disappointment. Inexpressible anxiety welled up in Nozomu's chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you so much. Sorry about that. I've said a lot of horrible things about you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, is that demon beast related to you in any way?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had to say something. Nozomu thought so, and as he spoke quickly, he involuntarily put his hand over his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina was silent for a few seconds, then slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That transformed Garm was the same demon beast that killed my family and friends and destroyed the Nebula forest."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-206"></a>"Hah?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">" Surely, it's not the same beast that destroyed my hometown. I don't know why it is here in the Spasim Forest, but there is no mistaking those crimson eyes."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's past was told to him as if she was pushing it out of her mind. If you look closely, you will see that her eyes, staring into the distance, are filled with tears that seem to be on the verge of spilling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was speechless at the expression on her face as she struggled to keep the tears from falling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have you lost someone, too?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A grave. It was here, near the hut."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's gaze turns to Shino's grave beside the hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She is my master. Sleeping sickness, just a while ago. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was she important to you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"......, benefactor."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's painful, isn't it? It's hard to lose someone you care about ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">After her feeble monologue, silence once again fell between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The quiet wind gradually became stronger and began to rustle the branches and leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if accompanied by the rasping sound of the wind, the breathing becomes shallow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Little by little, Nozomu felt her sense of uneasiness growing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your family and late friends are also ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He tried to start a continuation of the conversation to cover up his growing uneasiness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shina stood up as if she was trying to control him, and quickly turned herself around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll be back soon. Thanks for the meal ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina gets off the roof with the soup in her hands, which has cooled down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu unknowingly clenched his fists tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What he felt for Shina was a kindred spirit and longing. At the same time, however, he also sensed a stark difference between himself and her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them had built high walls against others, both of them held secrets they could not tell others, and both of them were looked at coldly by those around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu ran away to protect himself, and Shina continued to struggle against herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-207"></a>Her attitude of never truly losing sight of her own goals and moving forward was dazzling to Nozomu, who had turned her back on reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she is now beginning to wear the same air of resignation as Nozomu before as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This makes Nozomu feel frustrated, even though it is not about him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even though they share the same hesitations and darkness, Nozomu and Shina's thoughts and feelings do not cross.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them have not yet taken the first step in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are too busy enduring, too used to being on their own, to have the courage that is truly important.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu's premonition came true in the worst possible way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next morning, Nozomu and the others found only an empty Shina blanket and a note from her saying, "Leave the rest to me, please take care of Mimuru and the others.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jararara, gishigishi …….</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the Bottom of the lake full of darkness. Deep within the depths of his soul, the giant dragon was once again glaring at the chains that had been wrapped upon the whole body, as if disgusted by those chains.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat itself had not expected to be defeated and taken in by a human.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An unexpected situation. However, the strange environment brought a ray of light to the thoughts of the giant dragon, which had been sealed up in that world for thousands of years and sunk in a swamp of white muddiness place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is extremely unpleasant to be taken in by a human being, this is fortuitous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It may have been possible to capture the giant dragon with extraordinary probability, but the sealing vessel is still a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would easily self-destruct with just a slight loss of balance of power and mind. Then, in a real sense, Tiamat can be revived.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrrrr ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(For now, let's be resigned with the shackles of these chains. In any case, this fragile and weak host cannot escape his fate. Then, when the time is come ......) With a jarring motion, one of the chains that bind Tiamat is undone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resurrection to the world. Tiamat quietly waits, confident of the upcoming day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat quietly waits for the moment when the seal, which is exquisitely balanced, will be broken.</p>
<p class="softbreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-208"></a>†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell is she thinking? She told people not to be reckless, and now she's doing this to herself!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who had learned of Shina's arbitrary action, was stunned and asked Mimuru, Kevin, and the others to escort the wounded, and was chasing after her alone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She had some kind of connection with that demon beast. From her appearance yesterday, it was immediately clear that Shina had gone to settle the score with that demonic beast all by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The past that she wants to forget but cannot, the desire not to involve her friends, and the guilt over the danger to her friends that she herself has brought upon herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of these are complicated and intertwined, resulting in his arbitrary actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（What a pain in the ass!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">While uttering in the back of his mind, Nozomu's brain recalled her unintentionally revealing her overflowing emotions at Shino's hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, her dismissive attitude would appear cold-hearted. But it was a mask she wore to protect her own heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, she would be rigid in her thinking and inflexible. But it was a frame she had put in place to keep her from losing sight of her own dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A girl who was kind but could only speak harsh words. A girl who was weak but desperately trying to be strong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... I guess I'm just as much trouble as you are.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina has been unable to tell Mimuru and the others because she is afraid of involving others in the settlement with the black magical beast. Nozomu, too, has not been able to tell Irisdina and the others about his secret, fearing that the power he carries inside might run out of control.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a matter of fact, the two were very similar in this sense. That is why Nozomu was so concerned about Shina. He was repulsed by Shina's refusal to believe his words, but he was also worried about her imbalance and perilous situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If she is going to end up with that demon beast, the place she is headed to is probably where she encountered it yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering the time she left, there was no time to spare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it, please just in time!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">At any rate, his feet quickened as if his first priority was to get to her. Right now, he just felt frustrated that his legs were slower than he wanted them to be.</p>
