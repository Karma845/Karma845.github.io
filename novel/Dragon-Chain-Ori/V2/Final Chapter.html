<h3>Final Chapter: The Sinking Shadow, A Black Speculation</h3>

<p class="calibre1">"Fu ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A woman greets Jihad upon his return to his office at the school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her name is Inda Metis. She is Jihad's right-hand assistant at the school and is the homeroom teacher for the first and second classes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How was your day?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's definitely Abyss Grief. Once we retrieve the body, we will transport it to the Groaurum Institution. The report can be found here ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad handed Inda the documents, which she quickly read through.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm so glad to hear that Shina Yuriel has regained her connection to the spirits.I am delighted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this is ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, bountis. What do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  have  no  idea  .......  I  just  honestly  can't  believe  that  an  ability  suppressor  could  fight  that Abyss Grief and survive."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah,  usually  he  wouldn't  be  make  it.  That  means  he  has  enough  to  make  up  for  such  a handicap. As a teacher at this academy, I'm happy for him."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally, the Solminati Academy was designed to train personnel lost in the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there is something that just fills in the ability suppression. It is a single skill or experience, and it is something that can be passed on to others. If the report was correct, it was only natural that Jihad would be concerned about Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inda, on the other hand, sensed a known color in Jihad's every word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did Jihad-sensei already know about him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, a little from an old acquaintance, in case you were wondering. So what do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad's gaze was diverted from Inda and turned to a corner of the office. There, a male student in school uniform was leaning his back against the wall, looking listless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know. Well, I think he's an interesting guy. He seems to be liked by that black-haired princess."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boys nodded at his words, and Jihad turned his attention back to Inda.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everything in that area should be fine, and we should be able to go on as planned."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I get it. Then just keep it going."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay. Then I will go now ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-242"></a>Inda  bows  and  leaves  the  office.  Of  the  two  remaining  men,  the  male  student  cowering  his shoulders asks Jihad.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What am I supposed to do? Do I just look for it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, not now. it's okay to just observe. It's not likely that he is a spy yet. Even if he is, it doesn't matter as long as we can figure out what he's doing."</p>
<p class="calibre1">For Jihad, it does not matter much whether Nozomu is a spy or not. To begin with, a number of spies have already infiltrated the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Arcazam is aware of both their members and allies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, just as each country has a counter-intelligence agency organization, this city also has its own counter organization of that kind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of the organization is "Star Shadow". The male student was also a student belonging to this organization.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be honest, I was curious about it too. Now that I have your approval, I'll get to work. I hope you'll pay me well."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A male student waved his hand and walked out of the office. His ears were triangular, standing on pins and needles, and a golden tail extended from his waist.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the forest, where the ground had been scraped painfully by fallen trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A gray robe stood like a shadow in a place covered with a new layer of earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't expect this to show up at ....... Sure, it's not impossible, but at this time more ....... Is that did inspire this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gray robe stared at the ground beneath his feet and muttered a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the place where the Abyss Grief that Nozomu and the others had defeated had been buried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was buried under the earth, there was a nose-piercing odor wafting from beneath the earth, and the air around it was filled with a heavy atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyway, I'm short-handed right now. I have to eliminate as much uncertainty as I can here</p>
<p class="calibre1">......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A cane extended from beneath the robe, the tip of which tapped the ground with a tap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, white light floods out and seeps into the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ku~a ――! Ku~a ――!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps startled by the sudden outbreak of light, the sleeping ravens fly away one after another, buzzing the trees of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crow, this is ominous ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-243"></a>The gray robes looked up at the crowd of crows that had suddenly taken flight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the light subsided, the odor from earlier had completely disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's better. The only thing left to do now is that abominable ruin dragon, ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A gray robe that turns away. His back is full of tension, as if he is cracking the air with a tingle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the forest, where no one knows. Only one raven, which did not run away, was hiding in the branches of a tree, staring at the gray robe with its red eyes.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">A young man with blond hair was walking through the spasim forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A sheet of letterhead is in his hand as he walks without hesitation between the trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He arrived at a place in the thickly covered Spasim forest, where the grass and trees had been mysteriously cut down over a wide area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trees around him bore numerous scars where someone had probably slashed them with a sword. Ken looked at these marks with a furrowed brow. Then he turned his gaze to one of the trees surrounding the open space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, what do you think you're doing?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ken greets Nozomu with a cold voice when he comes out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gulps and speaks with a heavy tone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ken, I have a question for you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's wheels, which had been stopped, began to tick and turn.</p>
