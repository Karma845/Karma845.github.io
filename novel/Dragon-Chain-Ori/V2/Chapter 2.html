<h3>Chapter 2: A Shade of “Bloom Flower” At The Alley</h3>


<p class="calibre1">After reporting to the guild, Nozomu party parted ways with Shina party and headed straight for the Ushiro-tei, the family home of Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, it would be just Nozomu, but this time Irisdina and the others were with him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason was to celebrate the accomplishment of the first party's mission.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also to get rid of the bad feeling of reporting the accomplishment of the commission, although no one said a word about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's why, kanpai"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kanpai"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm,......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu raises his cup to Irisdina's cadence. What is in it is not liquor, but juice. When Mars tried to order, he was stopped by Ena, his sister and the bar's signature girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Absolutely no alcohol for my brother!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Mars had once tangled with a customer who had complained about the restaurant's food when he was drunk, and since then he had been banned from drinking alcohol at home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, he was also not allowed to return home drunk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was wondering if you could tell me what happened to that old butler?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Externally, it's supposed to be a magical tool run amok, but we can't keep it completely under wraps. To some extent, I have explained this to the academy"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"... Is everything okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Frankly, it's not very good. But I'm glad Jihad-sensei told that he doesn't blame me and Somia, his student"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's good to hear....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">At Irisdina's words, Nozomu patted his chest in relief.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Rugato attacked, warding magic was cast on the Francilt mansion and the battle took place inside the mansion, but that was only on the Francilt mansion area. No damage was done to the town.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, it was Irisdina's opinion that there would be a tolerable portion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, you didn't release your ability suppression, did you?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's heart thumped loudly at Mars' abrupt words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah for that. I didn't have the opportunity or the need to do so...... I've told you before, I'm still can not control it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But you could have used it. It's not like it's going to take long, and once you use it, the people who make fun of you will shut up, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-54"></a>"That's......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, showing the power of Tiamat once released would silence the other students who always make fun of him. But at the same time, Nozomu will definitely be asked to explain this power in detail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If this happens, they may also find out about the existence of the giant dragon that Nozomu has come to harbor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A sense of fear and severe agitation ran down Nozomu's spine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What will they look at him like if they find out? And how will he be treated?</p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  time  in  hundreds  of  years,  the  godlike  creature  called  dragon  slayer  is  back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu is not optimistic enough to think that everything will be smooth sailing as he thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What's more, Tiamat was still alive inside Nozomu's body, and as if it was conscious, he could still sense its mighty presence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even after the battle with Rugato, Tiamat has even interfered in the form of dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, there was a greater sense of foreboding that Nozomu's becoming a dragon slayer would  rather  lead  to  various  fright  and  troublesome  situations,  political  disputes,  and international problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"His strength is his extremely control of his qi. It's not surprising that he doesn't like to feel anything out of the ordinary."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, and it looks like Nozomu-kun's been under a great deal of strain. ...... He slept for more than half a day before, remember?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, yes, that's true,....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he seemed to have some thoughts about it, Mars nodded his head in agreement with Irisdina and Tima, and did not pursue Nozomu any further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A  beat  of  silence.  Trying  to  cover  up  the  slightly  awkward  atmosphere,  Nozomu  opens  his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was just wondering... ....... Why were Kevin and his friend  so resentful of her?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By her, do you mean Shina Yuriel-kun?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina confirmed Nozomu's question, and he gave a small nod.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, you don't know her?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu  tilted  his  head  at  Mars,  who  looked  a  little  surprised.  Mars  let  out  a  sigh  of exasperation at Nozomu, who really didn't get it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Most of the students who had been venting their hostility against Shina, were beastmen. They are all from the Sumahya Union"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sumahya Union..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's words triggered a line of questioning in Nozomu's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-55"></a>The Sumahya Union is a country in the southern part of the Arkmill continent, a newly emerged nation founded by a group of people who lost their country due to the great invasion of demonic and magical beasts that occurred 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  not  only  human  races  but  also  many  subhuman  races  live  in  the  area,  which  is described as a melting pot of races.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elves are another race that belongs to the Sumahya Union, but the problem was the behavior of the elves during the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically,  elves  do  not  associate  with  other  races.  In  particular,  only  elves  were  allowed  to enter the Nebula Forest, their stronghold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nebula Forest was originally created by the spirits that dwelled in the great tree that rises in the center of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the elves made a contract with the spirits of the great tree long ago, and have lived in harmony with them for thousands of years since then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  defense  of  the  forest  protected  by  the  elves,  who  have  an  extremely  high  affinity  with spirits, and the spirits of the great trees can truly be called an iron wall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  addition,  the  forest  of  Nebula  is  always  shrouded  in  thick  fog,  and  only  elves  who  can communicate with spirits can even live there in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, even during the Great Invasion, the elves did not heed the warnings of other races and did not accept help from them because it was their sanctuary, as it had always been.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other nations also believed that the Nebula Forest would be able to withstand the invasion of the magical beasts for half a year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, as I recall, the Nebula Forest was ...... about a week after the Nebula Forest was attacked by the demon beast..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the forest of elves fell faster than expected. The reason, it seems, was that the great tree at the center of the forest was attacked by demonic beasts that came out of nowhere, and the "high elves" who communicated with the tree were annihilated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore,  after  dropping  the  Nebula  Forest,  the  demonic  beasts  went  straight  into  the neighboring country, which had not yet finished preparing its defenses, and brought it down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the refugees who had warned the elves were there, and many were killed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course, a country's inadequate defense system is its own fault. But not for those who lost their families and homelands. Moreover, after the fall of the Nebula Forest, the speed of the demon and magical beast invasion increased, and many countries collapsed as a result"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  early  fall  of  the  Nebula  Forest.  The  chaos  created  more  chaos  and  triggered  the  chain reaction collapse of many countries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As it turns out, this is a critical deterioration of the elf's position.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After the Great Invasion, the surviving elves fled to territories within the current Union, but many in the Union still harbor animosity toward the elves because they ignored reinforcements and warnings from other races. Kevin is one of them"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina continues her story, moistening her mouth with the juice in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-56"></a>"However, it is not as if the elves are completely ostracized within the Union. It is true that the elves' spirit magic was of great help in recapturing territory after the invasion"</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Operation Fructus]</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the largest counterinsurgency operation of mankind, which took place over a period of four years immediately after the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to this campaign, which lasted from the first to the fourth stages, the invasion of the demonic  beasts  was  halted,  albeit  with  many  casualties,  and  the  territory  was  subsequently recaptured to some extent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was not possible to recapture all the territories occupied by the demonic beasts, and this operation is now in the middle of the fifth phase, which has been postponed indefinitely due to the exhaustion of the countries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know...., Tom-kun and Mimuru-san. As I recall, they are both from the Sumahya Union just like Kevin. And the silver wolf tribe's homeland has not been liberated yet......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"On the one hand, they were hated, but on the other hand, they became friends. The friendship between the two was a manifestation of the chaotic situation of the Sumahya Union"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I recall, after the Great Invasion, the recapture of lands occupied by demonic beasts was also...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, it stops at the Nebula Forest. And despite the destruction of their homeland, it was the wolf  people,  Kevin's  parents'  generation,  who  warned  them  about  the  Nebula  Forest.  That's what I mean, so it's a difficult problem"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry to kept  you waiting, here you go! Steak of hole rabbit steak, whole roasted bird, and salad and bread!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Ena, Mars' sister, brought in the dishes one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The dishes were served on large platters, as one would expect at a bar, and the air was filled with steam and an aroma that stimulated one's appetite.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now that the food is here, let's enjoy it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if invited by Irisdina and as if to change the mood, each began to reach for the food.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, the group was a bit reserved as they tucked into their meals, but their pace gradually picked up due to the battle with the magical beasts and a fair amount of walking around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And before they knew it, a battle had begun over the remaining dishes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mars, that's my steak!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, the fastest one wins."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll take it then. Yes, it's delicious!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah-ha-ha-ha ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two boys in the prime of life fight over the food, and Irisdina takes advantage of the struggle to snatch it from the side. Tima, who was watching the three of them fight, gives a dry laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-57"></a>Before they knew it, their table had become the noisiest seat in the Ushiro-tei.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ha! They're good buddy, aren't they!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, onii-chan, you're so embarrassing....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hannah, who had been watching Nozomu and the others from afar, laughs broadly, and Ena lets out a sigh while holding the tray.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu forgot about the lump in his throat, and he, Mars, and Irisdina were fighting over the remaining food.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A long-lost smile appeared on his mouth.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the four of them had finished their dishes at the ushiro-tei, they were each ready to return home after the banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The commercial district, which plays an important role in Arcazam's economy, never ceases to be lit even after the sun goes down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The four of us walked along the road illuminated by the cantera lights of the stores.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, Mars, whose home is in ushiro-tei, did not have to come along, but he was forced to by Hannah, who was angry at him for leaving the two women as they were.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Ugh, I ate too much .......'</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Nozomu who was groggy. His stomach was on strike as a result of of eating too much.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The digestive organs are frantically expanding and contracting, trying to push the contents out of the body, while the digestive organs are releasing warnings that it is in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Nozomu, who would have been in for a problemif he had take it out, was rubbing his stomach and holding his mouth to appease his stomach, which was on the verge of a violent outburst, and trying his best to hold it together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, our food is basically quantity. Some people eat too much"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The food tasted good, too, It's not the same as the food we have at home, it's a little stronger, but it's good for once in a while"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  quantity  of  food  is  not  the  point,  but  the  taste  was  good,  too.  The  taste  was  good,  too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike the food at home, the seasoning was strong, but it was good once in a while.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, Mars and Irisdina, who should be eating as much as Nozomu, are looking unperturbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can understand Mars because he is big to begin with, but what is going on with Irisdina, who has a thin body line?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, actually, I was secretly using magic, i was lightly applying body enhancement magic to my internal organs"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiled lightly as if to answer Nozomu's question.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-58"></a>Enhancement magic, as the name implies, raises the level of various bodily functions. It seems that she was improving the function of her digestive organs with it. Moreover, seeing that she was not chanting, she must have been using her ability "Immediate Deployment" as well. What a waste of magic!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh my goodness, Ai. But in that case, what you eat doesn't disappear....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah. I have to keep working later for the food I eat......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a dry smile, Irisdina looks into the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was the one who was most affected later on. Especially for a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You got what you deserved!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina stares off into the distance with a shadowy expression on her face, and Tima's precise correction comes in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprisingly, Tima was the one to give the nod to her best friend's unthinking behavior. It was a very unusual sight for the normally dignified and mature Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm! Well, it's getting late, let's go home soon. Somia is also waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina coughed deliberately to cover up her own ugliness, and then she walked ahead of the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them let out a sigh at the sight of her, but followed her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's always lively here. Even at night, there are always a lot of people around"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, it's a commercial district afterall"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina blurted out, and while Nozomu agreed with her, the four of them walked side by side along the street.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, Nozomu's  stomach began to  feel  better, albeit  gradually, but  as he was  walking down the street, Irisdina, who was walking next to him, suddenly pulled his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, come here...... for a minute"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh! Uwa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was taken directly into the shadows of the alley. Nozomu was perplexed, wondering what was going on, when the face of a beautiful dark-haired girl appeared before him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I just wanted to leave Tima and Mars-kun alone for a minute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"....Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As you know, Tima is not very good with men. But I thought this would be a good time to get her used to them"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina pointed to Tima, who was looking right and left with her eyes wide open. Apparently, she was in a state of panic because she was suddenly alone with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"She seems pretty confused...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu fu, Isn't she adorable?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-59"></a>It was hard to tell whether the tone was a retort to his earlier tattling, or whether he was really concerned about his best friend, but to Nozomu it sounded somewhat like the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Irisdina-san, you have bad taste in the weirdest ways"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, no, that's not true. Tima is scary when she gets angry"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought that Nozomu had offended her before, but she didn't say anything more. He did not say more than that, because he somehow knew that if he said it out loud, her point of view would turn from Tima to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu let out an involuntary sigh at the intuition that works in strange places.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I mean, are you still calling me "San "?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When he looked up at the disgruntled Irisdina's voice, he saw her face coming closer to his vision.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though the distance is close, the beautiful face comes so close that you can almost breathe on it. Nozomu's cheeks turn bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"For now and later. Call me by my name. I shall call you Nozomu, too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ee eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah right, you can nickname it like Tima did"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"N~no, I mean,... that"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hora~hora"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was at a loss for words in the face of Irisdina's continuous attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was so embarrassed that he was urged to run away from the place, but unfortunately, Irisdina firmly holding his arm, and he was not going to be able to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"O-okay, then, I......ris"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think it's  still a little stiff. Well, I  guess  we can't  help  that.  Let's think on that later. Well then....., let's go on a date for the night"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Hah?"</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Huh, wh-where did you two go -----!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Nozomu was being dragged on a date by Irisdina, Tima, who was left alone with Mars by her best friend's trickery, was screaming inaudibly, her face bright red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Wh-why  i  am  alone  with  Mars-kun  -----!  Ai  and  Nozomu-kun,  who  were  next  to  me disappeared before I knew it! Why? Why!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her heart beats wildly in response to her agitation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-60"></a>Unknow of what to do, Tima, who had reached the peak of her nervousness, was drenched in sweat from her forehead, her eyes widening as her gaze darted this way and that, as if looking for help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What happened to Nozomu and her? When did they disappear and ...... become lost?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah~u, that's right, Um~ ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite being spoken to by Mars, Tima's reply was not a body of words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not surprising to hear people say that birds or monkeys imitated humans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（Wha~, I don't know what to say! I've never talked to a boy alone like this before! Ai, help me ------!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In my heart, i ask for help to my best friend who is not here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,  the  source  of  the  problem  is  that  best  friend,  of  course,  there  is  no  way  she would come to her rescue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh man, the roads are so convoluted around here that it's hard to find them if you deviate from the path..... If you can't find it after a while, we'll go on. Okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Umm, yes. Please......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Mars begins to walk, leaving a few steps behind, and Tima follows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A silent moment passed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima keeps her face down, staring at his back as he goes on ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I first met this man, he was very scary. He suddenly glared at me and intimidated me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My legs were shaking so badly that if my best friend had not been by my side at the time, I might have fallen off my back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, that sense of fear, I realized, was slowly fading.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am nervous. In fact, I can't even talk face to face like this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But we are able to walk together like this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Normally, I would have run away immediately......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the outside, Mars is notorious for being a scary-looking, tough guy and an untouchable delinquent. When did my fear of him fade away? I knew as soon as I thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ena-chan and ...... then from the fight with Rugato-san)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ena, Mars' younger sister, was a solid girl in Tima's eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who was fighting with her, had no thorny hostility that he usually emitted from his whole body, even though he raised his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And what was decisive was the attack on Rugato.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima struggled to protect Somia, but was about to be defeated beyond her strength, when Mars, who was supposed to hate her, saved her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Tima did not expect him to save her.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-61"></a>".... What a bunch of fools you are. You concentrate on your magic. I'll take care of that old man's magic"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The words of Mars, who turned his back on the completely stunned Tima and confronted the vampire butler, were directed at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Tima heard it, she felt that her and his feelings were indeed becoming one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhm, no, nothing!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">".....,I see."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars notices Tima's gaze and turns around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima looks tense, and Mars cannot say anything more, and a silence passes between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“…… I was bad at that time.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">"eh"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  time  we  met,  I  gave  you  a  hard  time  when  we  first  .  I  hadn't  properly  apologized yet,......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars scratched his cheek and apologized for staring at me when we first met.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His expression was a little darker, as if he was still bothered by what had happened, and he awkwardly turned his gaze away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thst, it's fine! I don't care anymore. Besides, you helped me that time........."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was a little surprised to see him without his usual intimidating demeanor, although it was different from the gallant manner in which his best friend was known. She had always thought of him as someone who would never regret or apologize for his actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such an unexpected attifude by Mars opened Tima's heart, which had been tightly closed with a sense of tension, a little.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I~i haven't thanked you properly yet, haven't I?...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was a little scared when I met him, but he still lent me his strength when it mattered most.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"At that time, I think I couldn't save Somia-chan if Mars-kun didn't protect me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, if Mars had not protectTima, Nozomu would not have been come in time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My heart, which had been shaking with agitation, throbbed sweetly before I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A feeling of tension that is different from the previous one. My face, which I could not raise, naturally looks up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's why ... for that ......... thank you ........."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's mouth spontaneously spun words of gratitude as she felt a surge of emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars seemed speechless at  the words,  which were directed only at  him,  and then he turned away, his face flushed red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While wandering around, he bites the air like a fish on the verge of suffocation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-62"></a>"Mars-kun?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima's expression gradually darkens at Mars' lack of response.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have to say something!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Driven by this feeling, Mars desperately squeezes the air out of his lungs and shakes his throat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh~uhm, I see........."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what came out of his mouth was a very dumb reply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While Mars was flustered at the sound of his own voice, which was not as clear as if he had been drinking alcohol out of it, Tima smiled with a sense of relief.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad I was able to say it correctly..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Tima's sincere smile for the first time, Mars stopped even thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His whole body was in shock, and not only his face but also the depths of his chest became hot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars himself had noticed that he was acting strangely, but not wanting to be noticed, he turns away, this time to get away from Tima.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite his own actions, however, he couldn't help but notice the girl behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. It's Nothing........, let's get going."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um, yeah......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars starts walking and Tima follows him in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, they continue walking without speaking to each other. But unlike before, the two shadows find themselves standing side by side.</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Thank you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars thinks back to the past, wondering when was the last time he heard someone say those words to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as a child he was strong, and in fights none of the children his age could beat him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, when he got into fights, the adults around him would nag and scold him, but as he grew older, the only ones who would scold him head-on were his family members, Hannah, Dell, and Ena.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The rest of the people, adults and children alike, all cursed Mars behind his back instead of in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This only made him more irascible.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-63"></a>He  didn't  like  the  people  who  sneaked  around  behind  his  back  even  though  he  couldn't  say anything himself, the people who looked down their noses at him and sneered at him, the weak people who couldn't say anything back to him, and everything else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So he just got stronger and continued to take his frustration out on those around him. He knew it was annoying to Ena, Dell, and the others, but he couldn't and wouldn't admit that the others were weak.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other than that, he didn't know how else to put his feelings into perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps he had gone too far, even the meritocratic Solminati Academy was too much for him and he was dropped to the lowest class, but he still did not want to admit the weakness of the people around him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason why he could not do so was because of the scar that was engraved in his heart "I was abandoned with my sister by my father who was weak"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I see someone's weakness. Each time I did, I felt an inexhaustible surge of irritation, as if I had burned fire stick shoved into my gut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（But why? Just those words from this person, and the irritation disappears like a lie. Not only that, something about.....)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars peeks at the girl walking next to him with a sideways glance, so as not to be noticed by Tima.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She has a small face, wide eyes, and a clear nose, and her white nape of the neck peeks out from under her moegi-colored hair, which is neatly trimmed down to her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fever that I thought had receded returned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By, by the way, do you have any sister?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He kept having feelings that he did not understand, and tried to talk to her as if he was trying to do something about it. He wanted to cover up these feelings that he had never felt before by doing something.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I don't have a sister, but I do have one brother ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was on board with Mars's no-nonsense story, but she was acting strangely, too.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tima was on receiving with Mars's no-nonsense story, but she was also acting strangely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face was strangely red and her movements were more jerky than ever. She looked like a badly made golem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is~is that so?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mars' appearance was also like a broken golem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His voice was hoarse, his gait strange, and his gaze uncertain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the two, like broken dolls, forgot all about the deviant Irisdina side and played out a strange puppet show from start to finish until they parted in front of Tima's house.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-64"></a>While Tima and Mars were creating a sweet and sour atmosphere, Nozomu, accompanied by Irisdina, was strolling through the commercial district.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Na, uhm, Irisdina-san ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">“…………”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's  shoulders  slumped,  as  if  in  contemplation,  as  Irisdina  stared  at  him  silently,  not replying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">”I~Iris .......”</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, what is it? Nozomu"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just in case we're going home, right? Aren't we kind of getting off the main street a little bit?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arcazam is divided into four sections, and a boulevard is constructed through the center of each section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  paths  spread  out  from  the  main  street  as  if  to  extend  its  branches  and  leaves,  and  now Nozomu and his friend were moving further and further away from the main street and into the paths.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's a shorter route. Arcazam is much safer than other cities. Even in the lanes, you can't smell the rotten smell. You'll be fine"</p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how good the security is, there are still those who would think of doing something wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In  particular,  she  is  the  daughter  of  a  leading  figure  in  the  Kingdom  of  Forsina,  Arcazams largest supporter. The value of her is immeasurable to a commoner like Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina, perhaps sensing Nozomu's concern, smiled and tapped her fingertips on the hilt of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"silver wings of the evening star," the thin sword at her waist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is  one of the most talented students  at  the Solminati  Academy,  and is  a talented  young woman who has been evaluated as worthy of the A rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  the  immediate  deployment  of  her  abilities  allows  her  to  activate  magic  without chanting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A thug could not even touch them, and even a well-trained soldier would literally be reduced to the touch of his armor by the use of body enhancement magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina continued onward and upward. Nozomu could tell by her lack of hesitation that she was familiar with such paths.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're very familiar with it. I didn't know about this shortcut...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I sometimes go out to commercial district and civic district with Somia"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite her always  exemplary honor student  and an atmosphere reminiscent  of a sharpened knight's sword, this girl has a surprisingly innocent side to her. In this respect, she was much like her little sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's  going  to  be  difficult  for  onward  because  I  have  a  chaperone  coming  in  the  near  future because of the incident with the Waziart family....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chaperone?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-65"></a>"I've  been  in  that  person  care  since  i  was  little.  It  seems  that  my  father  will  send  a  reliable subordinate because of that incident in the mansion"</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is said that the incident is taken very seriously even in the main Francilt family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's  person  is  very  nice,  but  very  demanding  in  many  ways.  Maybe  Nozomu  would  be noticed"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina is the next head of the Francilt family. As a noblewoman, she naturally expects her friendships to be of an appropriately high level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, Nozomu is a commoner. In his mind's eye, he could picture himself being stabbed from behind on a moonless night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's face paled as he remembered, after all this time, the difference in status between him and Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you scared? Fufu, it's okay. You're a benefactor of me and Somia. I won't let my parents do anything strange."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I beg you, really ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps amused by Nozomu's joy and sorrow at her own words, Irisdina giggles and smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, however, she was still inevitably curious about the power he had shown at the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I'd be lying if I said I didn't curious. I can't speak for Mars-kun either......) His amazing qi control and refinement swordsmanship. I already knew these things when I first met him in spasim forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she saw Nozomu's qijutsu "Phantom" she was indeed awestruck by the brilliance of his technique. If Irisdina had tried to create an equivalent blade, she would have needed ten seconds to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the "power" he showed later in the fight with Rugato was clearly beyond exceptional.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A vampire who has far greater abilities than humans in terms of race. And the quantity and physical ability to overwhelm them head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I cut off the conversation at the launch, but I have not lost interest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(It was like Jihad-sensei ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's mind is filled with images of the strongest swordsman at the Solminati Academy. He is the highest-ranked person at the academy and the hero of the Great Invasion of twenty years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a first class student, she had fought this man before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was still in the middle of my second grade. Even though I was inexperienced than I am now, I remember being beaten down at my wit's end, even though it took two of us with Tima.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As was the case when she fought Rugato, there is a difference between the A and S ranks that is hard to describe in a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-66"></a>That is such a wall. There is no way it can be easily crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(He  said,  "It  was  the  'release'  of  'ability  suppression.  Which  means  that  it  was  his  original ability)</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the root of my discomfort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I want to hear it, I want to know. The secret of its power. So that i can protect Somia this time</p>
<p class="calibre1">......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the incident with Rugato , Irisdina's interest in Nozomu had grown even greater.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His  outstanding  swordsmanship,  his  mighty  temperament.  Contrasting  with  this,  he  has  the guts of a young boy of his age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would like to know more about him in different ways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That feeling that rises in fills up like pouring water in a glass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Nozomu. Why don't you try to be more positively and show that power?) Words that have risen to the throat. Irisdina swallowed it with shocked expression on her face What  comes  back  to  my  mind  is  how  he  looked  when  I  asked  him  about  the  "power"  that defeated Rugato.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The way he was anxious and fearful made Irisdina hesitate to ask him any more deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a loud voice, not unlike that of a quiet pathway, rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, beautiful Ojo-san there. Would you like to come by?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Irisdina were startled by the sudden words, and their bodies trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they turned their eyes in the direction of the call, they saw a cozy little stall at the end of the path.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The signboard reads "Fortune-Telling" in large letters, and on the table are randomly placed crystals, cards, and jars filled with thin wooden sticks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the wall, there are many cards that seem to be from the East, accessories of unknown shapes for protection from evil or for curses, and even a skull and crossbones of a mountain or a sheep, for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My name is Zonne. As you can see, I am a humble fortune teller.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fumu, fortune-telling ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it doesn't look like fortune-telling for me ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">To  put  it  bluntly,  it  is  not  a  fortune  teller,  but  rather  a  recruiting  center  for  a  suspicious witchcraft organization or religious group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu also sensed something disturbing in the atmosphere surrounding the old man. It was the same atmosphere as that of a person he knew well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oji-san. What do you foresee?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-67"></a>"Anything.  I'll  guess  everything  from  the  future  to  tomorrow's  weather,  tonight's  dinner  to lover's affair!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(How can you tell if someone is cheating on you by reading their fortune? I can't stand it when people assume I'm cheating on my lover!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu suddenly didn't know where to begin, but  Iris Dina, who was surprisingly curious, seemed to be on board.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, looks interesting, so let's give it a try. What about you, Nozomu-kun?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, are you serious? I'm not ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yosh! Then, Ojo-san, let's get started!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu couldn't help but look at the old man, who ignored Nozomu and kept his eyes fixed only on Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The  old  man's  inability  to  listen  to  what  others  had  to  say  seemed  to  be  akin  to  that  of  his master.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Nozomu swallows down the complaint that is rising in him. He knew that this kind of old man would just ignore what he said and not listen to what he had to say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had thought that not many people could be that free-spirited, but it seems that the world is a small place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then let me see your palm"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking Irisdina's hand, Zonne pulls out a loupe and begins to study her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the old man's cheeks are slack and his hands are strangely disgusting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"... So, Oji-san, what's the result?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, I guess it will take a little longer"</p>
<p class="calibre1">An  old  man  stroking  Irisdina's  hand  in  the  street  with  a  smirk  on  his  face.  Nozomu's  anger gauge is rising rapidly at this act.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can't see very well. Let's try the other hand this time ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heaven's punishment"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He also tried to take the other hand, but then Nozomu's patience ran out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been seeing the image of Shino in Zonne's mind, and he slammed his sword down on the old man's brain as hard as he could.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ah, crap, I forgot to hold back. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing to an eldery?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jumping up in pain, Zonne yelled out with holding his head where he had been hit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that he could complain even though he was clearly the one who was sexually harassing her was a testament to the old man's character.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about, you pervert old man! You weren't telling fortunes a while ago!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-68"></a>"What do you mean, young man? It's a man's nature to want to touch such a exquisite flower when he sees it!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man readily admits that he had not done any fortune-telling and reiterated his claim.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"And a true man will do whatever it takes to get his hands on that flower! A loser like you can't do anything about it anyway. You can go now, it's too much for a slacker boy like you!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who are you to call me a slacker, you walking obscenity! Throw that kind of character in the rubbish with your dentures!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, on the other hand, had already completely thrown away his reserve toward the old man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two were cursing each other. But then a cold, icy voice interrupted their quarrel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... By the way, oji-san, how long do you intend to hold my hand?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt a cold sweat break out on his back at the sound of a voice so clear that everyone could hear it, yet so intimidating that it made him cower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He quickly looked at Irisdina's face and saw that she was twitching and her cheeks were drawn back in anger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A~Ah ... No, it's over. Hahahaha ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man, who had been directly confronted by her intimidating presence, turned pale and tried to leave the place quickly. However, he was unable to escape because she was holding his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, i agreed to it. I was going to laugh and miss some rudeness ... but it's a bit unpleasant"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">From Sonne's hand held by Irisdina, i heard a creaking sound of bones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ouch, ouch. Ah Ojo-san, hey, it hurts a little bit ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The creaking and clattering sound continued, as if the sound was being clamped in a vise. The pale  face  of  the  old  man  turned  purple.  I  looked  closely  and  saw  that  Irisdina's  hand  was glowing faintly with the light of her magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait,  I'm  sorry!  It  was  an  impulse!  Please,  Ojo-san,  don't  do  this  to  me!  you'll  shatter  my hand!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Irisdina does not accept the old man's plea. With an icy smile on her face, she applies more force to her clasped hands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mish-mish! Gokin!</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah~tsu……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whhhooooaaa~!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sonne's body shook as if struck by lightning, and he collapsed on the spot, foaming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old  man's eyes are completely turned and from  the side he looks like he is  about  to go straight to the coffin bin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(But this old man. I'm sure he'll never learn from this ..........)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-69"></a>Nozomu remembers his master, Shino. She was undoubtedly the best in swordsmanship, but in everyday life she was strangely childish and did not listen to others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She is a self-satisfied, self-driven old woman who throws threw tantrums when we disobeyed her,  just  like  the  old  man  who  was  dying  in  front  of  him.  In  Nozomu's  case,  however,  the ultimate damage was done to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Shisho. No matter how much you want to, you wouldn't just take the sword away and leave me in the forest ........)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering his past punishment, Nozomu's shoulders slump.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Previously, He once had his weapon taken away from him when he got into an argument with Shino and was left overnight in the Spasim Forest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Night is the time for demon beasts. In the midst of all this, Nozomu was struggling to catch his breath in the bushes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If he was attacked, he has no way to defend himself and has no choice but to run for his life. In fact, he had an experience in which he was attacked by a demon beast in the middle of the night and escaped with his life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, that we've punished this old prankster, let's get going.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"~tsu, ah, un......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu had sunk into past trauma, but Irisdina's voice brought him back to himself and they went back into the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All that was left behind was a pathetic ............ old man who had destroyed himself with his lust and was not at all what he had in his mind.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu left Zonne's fortune teller, but he was now embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  to  mention  the  reason.  This  is  because  Irisdina  saw  him  had  a  silly  quarrel  with  that perverted oldman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's eyes take on the color of a child who has come up with a naughty prank as Nozomu looks away and scratches his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufu, but I was surprised. I didn't expect you can to be so loud ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, no. That old man looked a lot like my master.  Maybe that's why I don't have to hesitate, or maybe it's because his natural, I'd get heat up. ...... Iris is suprissing one. I didn't think you would willingly go into that shady store.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, uh that ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to be outdone, Nozomu also fought back. Even he had not imagined that Irisdina would voluntarily enter such a suspicious store. At the very least, it would not be the behavior of an ordinary noblewoman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina,  perhaps  aware  of  this,  is  looking  embarrassed,  her  cheeks  reddening  and  her  gaze wandering about.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-70"></a>"Making fun of a maiden, you're a pretty mean guy too"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ue?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps  the  embarrassment  went  around  and  made  him  regret,  Irisdina,  whose  cheeks  were swollen, glared at Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The impression that she was cute rather than scary was very similar to her sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come to think, you gave Somia an armlet as a gift"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu tilts his head at Irisdina, who glances at him meaningfully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Uh, what is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're not very perceptive, are you? you're on a date right now"</p>
<p class="calibre1">While wondering if the setting was serious, Nozomu finally hit on the word "date".</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Maybe she want something like the armlet i gave to Somia-chan, but she suddenly said ......) While slumping his shoulders, Nozomu looks at Irisdina's figure once again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her slender limbs and slender waist. She has the appearance of an exquisite doll. Her hair is shiny  and  pitch-black  like  the  darkest  night.  Frankly,  the  materials  are  so  powerful  that  no matter what you choose, all you can see is the sight of the present being completely defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Nozomu's eyes caught sight of Irisdina's glossy hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Come to think of it, she's not wearing a hair clip or anything .....) Nozomu thought this while looking at her silky black hair dancing in the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hair has the property of storing magic power. For this reason, magic users, especially women, tended to grow their hair long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How about this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu picked out a thumb-sized ornament from a stall that sold a variety of handy sundries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a hair clip encrusted with white glass balls. The small light-colored beads glittered in the flickering flames of the cantera.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A hair clip. Not bad"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's voice sounded a little flat. Nozomu was relieved to hear that she seemed to like the hair clip more than he had expected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina smiled at the hair clip he handed her, lightly combed her bangs by hand, and put the clip on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's well-groomed hair was lifted, revealing her face with well-defined features.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu felt that the usual dignified yet unapproachable atmosphere had eased,  and she felt more familiar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you think??"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It looks good ...., but the hair clips is in complete defeat. I knew the material was too different"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu fu, Thanks"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-71"></a>Irisdina's smile deepens at Nozomu's words. The two left the commercial district as they were.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vermilion light shining through the store window gently shines on her, who is wearing a white hair clip.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After  leaving  the  commercial  district,  they  passed  the  central  park  and  entered  the administrative district.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chaotic hustle and bustle of the city subsides, and the atmosphere of the town changes to one of quiet and serenity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I arrived at the Francilt mansion. In front of the main gate stood a maid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She has a straight back and sharp eyes. She was probably in her late thirties or early forties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She carried a powerful air that gave no indication that she was of mature age, and combined with the maid's outfit she wore, gave Nozomu a strong impression and a sense of discomfort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome back, Irisdina-ojo sama. It's been a long time"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mena ....... You're already here"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina's expression turns surprised as she confirms the maid's appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Iris, is she?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, just i told you. She's the one my father sent to me"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice  to  meet  you,  Nozomu  Bountis-sama?  My  name  is  Mena  Manat,  and  I'm  the  close associate of Viktor-sama, the head of the Francilt family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Irisdina introduced her, a mature woman called Mena bowed deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am truly indebted to you for what you did for us before. On behalf of my lord and master, I thank you from the bottom of my heart"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mature maid thanks him once again, while implicitly hinting at the attack of Rugato.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice was tinged with a tone of gratitude and relief that could not be hidden. That alone showed how worried she was about Irisdina and Somia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Should be, that the main family would express its gratitude. However, since this is a matter of such importance, please forgive me for expressing my gratitude on this occasion"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"N~no. I was able to save Somia-chan because I happened to be there ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this kind of awe-inspiring attitude is somewhat troubling for Nozomu. It is because he has never received this kind of attitude from an older person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since being dumped by Lisa, Nozomu had avoided contact with other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His  life  of  being  a  swordsman  had  almost  completely  deprived  him  of  the  ability  to communicate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, Nozomu was originally a commoner. He himself is aware that he is not in a position to be respected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, if you like, would you like to stay the night?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-72"></a>However, contrary to Nozomu's inner thoughts, Irisdina made a series of words that annoyed Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, I'm going back to the dormitory ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry to hear that. Hmm, I was hoping to hear more about you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  does  not  break  into  a  smile  when  she  hears  Nozomu's  refusal  to  answer.  Nozomu laughs dryly as she makes fun of him to the very end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, ha ha ha ..... Well, that's it for today"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks for helping me out today. Oh, that's right ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu walks away with a drawn-out smile on his face, Irisdina calls out to him as if she had just remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you want to go higher in the academy again, you should try the Adventurers' Guild, one of the few organizations outside the academy that has a direct influence on your grade"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll think about it ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, that's good. Good night"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good night"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina let out a small sigh as she watched Nozomu return to the dormitory, this time with a small bow of her head, and then turned back to the familiar maid who was standing by her side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once again, it's been a long time, Mena. How is my father?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, He's so annoyed that he want to see his daughter"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your attitude toward my father is still the same"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The words that Mena uttered with a thin smile on her lips were not the kind of words one would normally utter as a maid. But Irisdina was used to it and simply cowered her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is he the one who helped you in your fight against Rugato-shi? I see, he seems to be a very capable man"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As expeted, You know from the start?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am. I may look like this, but I am also a swordsman. I can tell how good people are with a sword from the way they stand. He seems to have a more fine and precise swordsmanship than ojo-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If Mena is on the edge, that makes most swordsmen less than on the edge ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena Manat was an excellent maid, but at the same time she was Irisdina's sword master. For simple swordsmanship, she still surpasses Irisdina, and is a swordsman equivalent to an A rank.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She  is  also  an  old  friend  of  Irisdina's  deceased  mother,  a  loyal  retainer  who  has  served  the Francilt family for a long time, and a woman who replaced her late mother for Irisdina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, there is a distance between them that is different from that of ordinary vassals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way, Mena, what is that thing you have in your pocket?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-73"></a>"What Is here? Here are the materials for ojo-sama matchmaking partners. Firts, It's Gruser-sama from the Glastheim family, Bain-sam from the Patton family, and then ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mena took out a thick sheaf of papers. Inside were profiles of the nobles she had selected as future partners for Irisdina, complete with their portraits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah...., that's fine. I'm going back to the mansion"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Irisdina was on her heels, as if she had not heard Mena's insistence on an arranged marriage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Geez, ojo-sama, are you aware that you are the next head of the ...... family?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're doing well at parties and such, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The problem is that at your age, you have not been with a man. It's time for you to start looking for a partner, you know?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are too persistent. In case of emergency, you could adopt a child, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are not even interested in adopting a child in the first place, are you? When Somiliana-ojo sama becomes a full-fledged woman, she will give everything to the child she has with her partner"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if she had been hit where it hurts, Irisdina's expression turned sullen, and without another word, she returned to the mansion. At that moment, Mena's gaze caught sight of the hair clip shining in Irisdina's black hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Ojo-sama. What's hair clip is that?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I found it on my way home and was curious. I bought it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina said that much and disappeared into the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After she left, Mena smiled meaningfully in front of the main gate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A white, simple hair clip. Considering Irisdina's good looks, it is clearly a floating item.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From Mena's point of view, Irisdina does not have an overly fashionable personality. But at the same time, if it becomes necessary, she can firmly choose items that suit her appearance and status.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was wearing a cheap hair clip that she didn't seem to need, and she was wearing it with great care. That was enough for Mena, with her keen intuition, to realize what was going on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I see, so that's what had happened. It's having a better effect than I expected ... I'm looking forward to it"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the material form for the matchmaking in her pocket, she, too, followed her master back to the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was trying to be faithful as a swordsman and a maid, and a smile of delight was on her lips when she saw the change in the girl.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-74"></a>Returning to her room, Irisdina exhaled loudly with a breath of air ......, propped her beloved sword on the wall, and sat down on her bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For her part, she had not expected Mena to arrive so soon. She had expected it to be another week or so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I guess that's how worried she was ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina  herself  does  not  doubt  her  father's  love.  Otherwise,  there  is  no  way  he  would  have allowed her to become the next head of the Francilt family, one of the great noble families of the Kingdom of Forsina, as a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, at the same time, he is an accomplished father as a nobleman and as a person who stands above the rest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder what's they plan to do about him ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding Nozomu, Irisdina reported only that he is an outstanding swordsman and someone who can lift his ability suppression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The letter only states that the defeat of Rugato was the result of cooperation with them, and it does not mention that he alone defeated a S-rank fierce opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She should have reported it. However, Irisdina did not do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The slight agitation and hesitation she saw in him when she asked him about his overwhelming power in defeating Rugato made her hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He's hiding something. Perhaps something to do with supression of his abilities"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something that made Nozomu hesitant to speak. When Irisdina became aware of his presence, the interest in him that swirled within her accelerated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I want to know about him. What is he thinking, what is he hiding, what is troubling him?</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That reminds me, his master had passed away. Did something happen to him at that time?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The master who is said to have taught him the art of swordsmanship. When he spoke of this person, he had a smile on his lips, though only a small one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Somehow, I don't like it ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I want to know, but I can't ask it. It is frustrating not to know.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is undoubtedly a manifestation of a strong interest in the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A tingle in the back of her chest. Irisdina wanted to suppress it and reflexively reached for her bangs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hair clip touched her fingertips. The hard, cold touch calmed the tingling in her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've never been so happy to receive a gift from a man who is not a member of my family"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She has a lot of experience in receiving gifts. However, there was always some kind of dark emotion behind the gift.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, she never keeps any gifts from non-family members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irisdina quickly gets up from the bed and goes to the dressing table, removes her hair clip, and begins to fiddle with her hair.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-75"></a>She changes her hairstyle several times, and when she finishes fixing it into the right shape, she re-fastens it again with the hair clip that Nozomu gave her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it like this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The soft atmosphere is further enhanced. She spontaneously spills a smile on her own face in the mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the tingle that had been calming down returns to her mind as she recalls the time when she received the gift.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's weird, I'm so nervous ...."</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the feeling was different.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like a soft heat, reminiscent of a winter fireplace. The warmth and comfort that gradually seeped into her body, she naturally put her hand on her chest and smiled cheerfully, the smile on her mouth deepening.</p>
