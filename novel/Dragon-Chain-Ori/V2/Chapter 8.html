<h3>Chapter 8: Connection Light at the Edge of the Shadow</h3>

<p class="calibre1">"Here is ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina had returned to the place where she had encountered the demonic beast yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To settle the fate of the jet-black beast that had harmed my friends. Above all, for her own will.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast was different from what she had seen back in her hometown, but she could not leave that dangerous beast behind in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fū,-fū,-fū......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her breathing naturally becomes shallow and raspy. Her heart was pounding so hard that it made her ears ring, and cold sweat was pouring down her back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（I'm going to do it, this time .......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Telling herself so, she released her magical power and diffused it into her surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she sees that the spirits reacting to the scattered magic power are gathering together as particles of light, she speaks to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Everyone, Please answer me. That black, filthy beast. Lend me your power to defeat it.) Contract magic to make a contract with spirits. It is a magic that connects the mind with the spirits present in the area through magic power, and enables the use of spirit magic that is only used by spirit species.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in addition to requiring an extremely high degree of affinity with the spirits in order for a contract to be formed, the time the contract can be held and the scale of the spirit magic that can be exercised are also unstable, depending on the spirits with whom the contract is made.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although originally considered a form of magic, it can only be used by elves, whose compatibility with spirits is innately far superior to that of other species, and careful preparation is required for other races to succeed with this magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason, this magic is practically treated like a special ability possessed by elves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why is ....... Everyone, why won't you all answer me?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shina still could not sense the presence of the spirits' will.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though she called out desperately, the spirits did not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Impatience grew, and even though she desperately tried to tell her own mind to calm down, impatience led to frustration, and the flow of released magic power became messy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance between her and the spirits who were watching her from afar became more distant, which further aggravated her frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(In the past, if I talked to them, they were all happy to respond to me. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>Tears come to her eyes as she remembers a time when she knew nothing and was happy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Razz ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">She thinks of her former spirit friend who has disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She used to play with her fellow elven friends, eat snacks with them in the trees, and sleep with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the beautiful appearance, the spirit was a foul-mouthed one, but when she thinks back on it, it was a thoughtful and irreplaceable friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it is only in the memory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her chest creaks and aches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（Please! I don't want to put Mimuru and the others in anymore danger! Please, everyone, give me a hand!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued to appeal to the spirits, using even the pain as a driving force to inspire her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru and Tom. She had clashed with Mimuru at every turn, but only then was the pain of her 20-year wound lessened. She was able to say what she wanted to say with all her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a great opportunity to loosen the taut threads, even just a little bit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued to frantically draw on her magical powers as she recalled her precious friend in her mind. At that moment, the image of another man came into her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why does his face come to my head......?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu Bountis. The one whom she had called a scumbag and kept rejecting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Shina has witnessed his wrongdoings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She didn't even feel sorry for him and thought he was untrustworthy to begin with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But he risked his life to save Shina, with whom he would have had a nasty relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What he looked like when he left, his appearance was so dignified that she could not believe he was the same person she had seen in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Why did he help me?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The question she wanted to ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the question came to mind, it became a number of interests, and even at a time like this, it made her heart well up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But she exhaled heavily with regret, convinced that it was probably not possible to be sure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zawa .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">The air around her changed drastically. The spirits that had gathered around Shina disappeared like spiders scattering.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-210"></a>A presence that can never be forgotten. From behind the overgrown bushes, countless red eyes shot out at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gurrrrrrrrrr ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">You've grown so ugly ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">A deformed beast that appeared. Its appearance had undergone a major transformation since the encounter yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost all that remains of its appearance as a garm is gone, and its body frame has become bloated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lower half of its body was covered with bare muscles, and countless eyes were open all over its body, wriggling and squirming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tail splits into three and grows huge, with jagged blades like a saw blade, and it seemed to have decided that Shina was its prey.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from the outside, it was hard to believe that it had once been a garm. But what frightened Shina more than anything else was the unusual source element light emanating from the misshapen beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">( I knew it, this beast has the power of a spirit ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The horror that seemed out of this world made Shina's heart shrink.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To begin with, only the spirit species that support this world can handle the power of the source element. Even elves can only borrow power in exchange for magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such power was being radiated from the beast's entire body in an uncontrolled manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fu fu fu ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina rebuked her trembling legs, bit her lip tightly, pulled several arrows from the quiver, and readied her bow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no time to make a contract with the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina had one chance. Before the black demon beast closes the distance, she must use all the power she has cultivated so far to defeat it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bow is pulled with all the strength she can muster, and the bow makes a grinding sound as it bows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bow is pulled to its limit, and all the magic power is sent into the arrow that is being held by the bow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the very beginning, the bow is at full throttle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The engraving on the arrow begins to glow with the magical power sent into it without thinking, and at the same time, a chanting is deployed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The strengthening magic by the magic formula increases the strength of the arrow and it begins to emit a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-211"></a>Then, the chanting magic creates a spiral wind that envelops the arrow with the strengthening magic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a simultaneous deployment of magic using two different techniques, the formula method and the chanting method.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the formation and chanting magic used in Arcazam are the latest magic deployment methods on the continent. At the same time, this is a heretical technique for the elves, who have been fighting with the help of spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this heretical technique was the power that Shina Yuriel, who had lost her spirit magic, had been studying and honing in this city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The accuracy of this technique was by no means inferior to that of the elite soldiers from various countries who had fought in the Great Invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shi~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina shoots an arrow at the beast, which rushes toward her with a roar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrow, tinged with light, was accelerated by the spiral wind, and it went straight for the beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the beast twisted its neck and caught Shina's arrow with its fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment's struggle, the wind-clad arrow was crushed with a creak and a squeak.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not yet!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shina, too, had already assumed that one arrow would not work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She took out three engraved arrows at once, filled them with magic power and released them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu, ooh ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrows were fired in rapid succession. One arrow, two arrows, three arrows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the blink of an eye, the pressure in her mouth quadrupled, and the "deformed demon beast"</p>
<p class="calibre1">moaned and groaned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take this!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina then struck it with a final blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The engraved arrow, which was infused with the greatest amount of magic power ever, gained acceleration and flew into the beast's mouth, shaking the atmosphere, and unleashed its hidden magic power all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic power of the four arrows that had already been shot into the beast's mouth was also combined, and a powerful blast of wind blew through the air. A powerful blast of wind blew through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kyaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blast, which shreds her entire body, blows Shina's body away.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-212"></a>She is knocked to the ground, and air leaks from her lungs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I did it ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She cracks the whip on her creaking, aching body and manages to raise her upper body to check on the demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrr ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blue-colored magic residues are dancing around, and the figure of the deformed beast is revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast is not even wounded by the bursts of magic power in its mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If seen closely, the light of the source element is gathered in the oral cavity of the "deformed demon beast".</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment when Shina's engraved arrow exploded, it must have used the power of the source element to protect it from the impact rupture.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fushuuuu ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A breath of murderous intent escapes through the gaps between its fangs. Countless red eyes glared at Shina again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "deformed demon beast" limbs are strained, and its body sinks down. Clearly, it is in a posture with the intent to attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her fingertips were trembling, and her hand holding the bow was only shaking fluently, with no strength.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... no, it can't ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing a death from which there was no escape, Shina exhaled deeply for once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of weakness that assailed her in the face of a reality from which she could not escape. The feelings that had frozen and held her back since the Great Invasion were now faltering, draining her of all energy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the moment when her heart, which had been fighting for so long, broke for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(It's over, I'm done ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment of the end of her life, she had many regrets in her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To have wasted the lives of her parents and sister, who gave up their lives to let her go. The fact that she could not get her hometown back. She have failed to reconcile with Mimuru and the others who went along with her. And yesterday, he took responsibility for her and let her go, but his efforts were for nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "deformed demon beast" kicked the ground. Shina does not know if it is because death is at her doorstep, but the movements of the beast that was coming towards her seemed to be moving very slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">( I' m sorry, ...... )</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-213"></a>An apology that came out of her mouth unintentionally. Shina's eyes gently tried to close, as if accepting her approaching death, while uttering words she did not even know to whom she was addressing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, in her hazy vision, a small speck of lapis lazuli light danced in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light, which was floating and flickering as if in a frenzy, flitted about as if it were standing between Shina and the demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">( Spirit? Everyone should have run away ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frightened by the foreign source material emitted by the "deformed demon beast," the spirits in the vicinity must have already disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A single fine spirit suddenly appeared, but its light was so weak compared to the other spirits that it seemed as if it would disappear at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the fine spirit stood between the demonic beast and Shina, as if to say, "Stay away from Shina".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its fleeting yet strong will reminds her of her former friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Razz ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lapis lazuli-colored fine spirit trembles, at the name of the friend who should have disappeared, which came out of her mouth unintentionally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuoooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But before she could confirm those words, the black demonic beast was already right in front of her.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's bad!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nozomu finally found Shina, the fangs of the demonic beast were about to seize her right now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uuuooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">No time to think. Nozomu rips off the chains that bind him and activates his flash step with all his might.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reaction from the damage left over from yesterday and the enormous amount of qi caused the muscles in his legs to tear and the skin to rip, but he didn't care, he intervened between Shina and the demon beast, and pulled out his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu, dust breaker.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If "Phantom" is a slash that cuts, this is a slash that gouges. The released qi blades expand and explode into countless needles, and the opponent's body is shaved off as if it were being filed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-214"></a>"Gabyaau!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's dust breaker slashed through the source material that the "deformed demon beast"</p>
<p class="calibre1">was clad in, and gouged out its mouth in a large gash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast shook its head, and a large amount of blood sprayed from its gouged mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Nozomu grabbed Shina by the collar and dragged her backward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aah, you~, you! What are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina can't believe that she has been saved and, more importantly, that Nozomu is here, and her eyes widen and harden. Shina's eyes widen as she begins to comprehend the situation, but the corners of her eyes begin to hang open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's my line, you fool! You're the one who's going in there alone without any chance of winning! You're the one who's being reckless!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean, 'fool'? I had a plan to win!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then why are you in such a desperate situation!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uuh, shut up! I screwed up a little bit!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Screwed up? That doesn't make any sense after all!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Words of abuse flying back and forth, selling words and buying words. The two, the emotional wheels of their lives having come full circle, temporarily forgetting their regrets, repentance, and other hang-ups, are screaming and moaning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gagyaaaa"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The roar of the beast echoes through the forest. Nozomu regains his composure at the sound of the roar and, while holding his weapon at the ready, he glares at the deformed beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"............"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishimishi, buch ....... The sound of something shredding in the depths of his body, in his ears, Nozomu chew on his navel inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I can't keep releasing it too long any longer ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The release of ability suppression, which had been carried out continuously since yesterday, had already reached a level where the accumulated damage could not be ignored, and it could break at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uoooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku~tsu……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps sensing the damage that Nozomu had sustained, in the next instant, the "deformed demonic beast" attacked him, raising its three serrated great tails. The wounds he inflicted are already regenerating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cih!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the approaching great sword-like tails, Nozomu dares to step in and swing his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-215"></a>If he tries to avoid it, Shina, who is behind him, will be killed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The air shakes and roars as the tails come at him, but Nozomu doesn't retreat, deflecting and repelling the barrage of blows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu strikes without backing down, even though he hears the sound of Shina gasping for breath behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, the demon beast sees Nozomu as a threat and doesn't even look at Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Then, there is no choice but to defeat it before it kill us!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmph!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He repels the three tail tips thrust into him with minimal movement, then steps forward and strikes with a barrage of qijutsu-dust breaker.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One, two, three, four blows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The four blows, released in an instant, once again slice through the source material that the magical beast is clad in, and burst forth, gouging out the beast's flesh over an extensive area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demonic beast painfully reaped the two tails.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu sliced both of the tails that had been reaped as if to pinch them with a high-speed slash and a reverse slash.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge tails fluttered in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu~o …"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wa ā ā ā"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, in front of the stunned beast, attacked in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The opponent's regenerative ability is not bad. It is sure to surpass even Rugato, whom Nozomu defeated at the Francilt mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If this is the case, then the attacker must strike until the regeneration becomes impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While slashing further into the gouged wound, he turns to the right side of the beast and slashes down its right front and back legs with a single sword.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, while holding his hands at his hips, he shot his qijutsu - shock cannon, which had broken his balance, into the flank of the demonic beast. The huge body of the beast was blown away by the intense pressure of qi that erupted from it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast falls to the ground, snapping several trees with its huge body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, determined to finish it off this time, pointed the tip of his sword at the beast and poured more qi than ever into the "Mumei".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-216"></a>The sword's blade began to glow with a dazzling light as the qi poured into it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(This is ...... the end!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the moment Nozomu activated his flash step and tried to finish it off at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The intense nausea and severe pain that came over me stopped him in his tracks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He involuntarily put his hand over his mouth and found that it was covered with bright red blood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Bad, I can't breathe. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing stopped and the heightened qi fizzled out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing is very important when dealing with qi. At the same time, since qi itself is a physical power, any modification of the body directly affects the accuracy of the qijutsu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demon beast, taking advantage of the momentary pause in Nozomu's onslaught, regenerates the leg that was cut off and sinks its body to leap at Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrr!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I won't let you!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Shina makes up for that gap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She aims at the regenerating paw of the beast with her bow, which she draws with all her strength, and releases an arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrow pierced the regenerating beast's left foreleg and exploded. The right foreleg is destroyed again, preventing the beast from rushing forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run, right now!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina urges Nozomu to retreat, but he cannot respond to her shout. The load that had built up in his body was heavier than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Geho, gah, hueh ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">His breathing is clearly not right.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how much he breathes in, the suffocating feeling that does not go away brings a bad premonition to Nozomu's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">（Oh no, has he punctured a hole in his lung?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a hole develops in the lung, air leaks through it when breathing, compressing the lungs and causing breathing problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the worst case, the lungs as well as the heart and various internal organs would be damaged, leading to death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, regardless of his will, his knees broke and Nozomu collapsed on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-217"></a>"G, ga, ah......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiamat's uncontrollable power raged through his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same intense pain that had punctured his lungs now began to consume his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This can't go on any longer. But the demon beast is still alive and well, though it is regenerating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, from behind the bushes, "Ding! Ding! The sound of footsteps echoed from behind the bushes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrrr"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wha~What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, a huge clay golem, perhaps three times the height of a man, emerged from the bushes. On top of the golem were the figures of Mimuru, Tom, Kevin, and Calanti, who had been separated in the shino hut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nah ......!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ikkeeeeee!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if following Mimuru's cry, a huge golem made of compacted earth rushes toward the demonic beast. It then pushes the beast into the ground and slams it into a huge tree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gyan!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, with Tom on his back, jumps off the golem, followed by Kevin and Calanti.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin and Calanti retrieve Nozomu, who was crouched on the ground. Meanwhile, Mimuru heads toward Shina, who is stunned with Tom on her back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shi ------ naaaaa! You stupid elf -----!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru charged at the elf girl, pushing Shina down and pinching her white, soft cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yee-hee-hee-hee! Hyah-hyah-hyah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's gonna stop, you stupid elf! Get ahead of yourself, get depressed on your own, and go away on your own ....... Eat my worry and Tom's exasperation ----!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin's mouth hung open as he looked down at Nozomu, and Calanti looked down at him with her cheeks swollen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yo, looks like you're alive, huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin sniffs sarcastically at Nozomu's silent gaze, which is filled with questions as to why he came here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, as the head of the party, I can't just walk away after daring the elf to do what she did.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, can you calm down a bit while I patch you up now?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-218"></a>Tom, his upper body bandaged, rushes over to Nozomu and reaches into his bosom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu let out a ragged breath as he re-applied the ability suppression to his body. The agitated qi calmed down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After confirming that Nozomu's qi had calmed down, Tom quickly began the treatment. He gave him a potion he had in his cloak pocket and cast a restorative spell on him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you here ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We couldn't just leave you two here. Besides, we wanted to say something to Shina too ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because my party got a break in your hut, too."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain and discomfort disappeared. Nozomu was relieved as her breathing regained its composure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad you're here, and thanks to Nozomu-kun, Shina is safe and fine. Of course, I'll still have to punish Mimuru's, though."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom smiles at Nozomu with a hint of anger, and Nozomu involuntarily pulls his cheeks back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, that giant golem is ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I made the golem by sharing the magic power from Kevin and the other party members. It's impossible for me to deal with that monster on my own, but I gave it regenerative powers, so it can buy me some time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuoooooooh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The golem was blown away with the cry of the demon beast. However, as Tom said, the fallen golem crumpled under the impact, but immediately began to regenerate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gughh ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You'll have to be quiet, man. We're here to help you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait a minute. You and the other party members are ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We can't move yet. It's too late to evacuate them. So we're going to have to deal with this demon beast right here."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin then stepped forward to protect Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But I never thought taht Garm, whom I failed to finish off, would turn out to be such a monster ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite his light tone, his expression was full of tension.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat down and clenched his fists. The leather strap of the cuirass he clutched creaked as his whole body was filled with a steamy atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to him, Calanti was poised as if leaning in close, and Mimuru was drawing her dagger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fuu......."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-219"></a>The next moment, with the sound of muscles creaking from the bodies of the three, their bodies begin to change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their body hair grows, their eyes narrow, and their claws elongate, transforming them into a more beast-like form.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Beastification'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the ability of the beastmen tribe to change their own bodies and further enhance their originally excellent physical abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike abilities that can be expressed by an individual, "Ability" is a general term for the unique abilities possessed by each race.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vampire that Nozomu fought once had the ability to "turn himself into a bat" which is also a different ability from the vampire's.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Beastification" the unique ability of the beastman tribe, is an extremely powerful ability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The dramatically increased physical ability also amplifies the ability of qi, which is the source of life force, resulting in an exponential increase in the person's own combat ability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, Kevin even used the ability "Lightning Transformation," and began to clothe his body in purple electricity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a combination of his abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"" "Ooooooooooo!" ""</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a beastly roar, Kevin, Calanti, and Mimuru leapt at the deformed demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin thrust out his waist-high fist of lightning, while Calanti and Mimuru unleashed a leg blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu~uuu …"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boom! and the air popped with a jolt that shook the trees of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trinity of blows, as if in unison, caused the deformed demon beast, which was more than twice its size, to back away slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the momentum of the blow, the three leapt at the deformed demonic beast and continued to slam their limbs into it while screaming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You fools ....... You won't even be able to retreat ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem is that the manifestation of a different ability has a significant disadvantage in some cases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While the " beastification" of the Beastman abilities greatly increases their physical capabilities, it also paralyzes their fear and other feelings, resulting in a significant reduction in their ability to make rational judgments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, their fighting behavior is linear, and they have no regard for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And even in beast form, their potential is not as great as that of a "deformed demon beast".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-220"></a>At present, Kevin was not only using "Lightning Transformation" as well as beastification, yet he was not able to damage the demon beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuoooooooo!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demon beast, which let out a majestic roar, whipped up the wind as if it was in the way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light of the source element leaking from its body turned into a black wind that blew Kevin and the others away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast then transformed into a huge saw-like tail, which it hurled at the three of them like a spear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuuu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The jet-black spears were still in the air and approaching the three defenseless fighters. The three were still in the air, defenseless, but the jet-black spears were coming at them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Boon ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the revived golem compensates for the gap between the three.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It interrupts the path of the three protruding tails and catches the attack of the deformed demonic beast with its huge body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zu, zuzun! and the golem's head and torso are severely damaged by the impact.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the golem immediately begins to regenerate due to the regenerative ability that Tom has granted it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversely, it fixed the tail that had pierced itself with its own regenerated body, and in the meantime, Kevin and the others attacked the demonic beast again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the three of them specializing in all-out attack and the golem's defense that relied on its regenerative abilities, they were walking a tightrope in their battle against the deformed demonic beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We can't ....... We can' t win against that beast at all ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's powerless voice echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the destination of Kevin and the others' battle was in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their attacks, like Shina's engraved arrows, were blocked by the source material that the deformed demonic beasts were clad in, and they were not able to strike any effective blows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the influence of the source element that the demonic beast wore began to suck out the magic power that was building up the golem's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The golem's regenerative ability, which had been supporting its defense, gradually became unable to keep up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, we don't have time for nonsense. Come here."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-221"></a>Tom took Shina to the rear, out of reach of the aftermath of the battle, and began to draw a camp on the ground around her with a stone that was nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, what ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to ask you straight out, Shina. That demon beast has the power of a spirit species, doesn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Y~, yes ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I knew it. That means the only way for everyone to survive here is for Shina to be able to use spirit magic, is that it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The six-pointed star formation based on the six elements. The formation that imitates a circle is surrounded by numerous encircles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was somehow similar to the magic circle of Tima Lime.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The spirit can be fed on both magic and qi. Besides, that demon beast is quite a gluttonous eater. My golem wouldn't be compatible with it, and it wouldn't last long."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom also placed a magic stone with the six attributes of red, blue, green, yellow, white, and black on each apex of the hexagram. It was truly an altar with magical circles and ritual tools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contracting with spirits is where elves excel the most. However, it does not mean that humans cannot also contract with spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is possible to temporarily borrow the power of the spirits with a very limited number of people and suitable rituals. For this purpose, Tom built an altar, albeit a simple one, at this location.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina calls out the spirits at the center of this formation."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just focus on talking to the spirits. I will support you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's why ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry, as long as Mimuru and the others can fight, they won't let it touch you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, I'm not! Why did you come? I hurt you all that much!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's mouth began to overflow with the things she had been suppressing until then, as if she had been dammed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cry of a girl bound by the past echoes through the trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If I hadn't been so reckless, everyone would be safe! You're always so bossy, always telling people what to do, but when push comes to shove, why are you trying to save me when I can't do anything!</p>
<p class="calibre1">After she finishes screaming for a moment, she looks down and lets out a rough breath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at Shina with such a calm expression on his face, Tom said, "I have a message from Mimuru," and then slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-222"></a>"It's because I'm not convinced. Especially Mimuru ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't want to falter, so I move, I chase after you. I don't think about the reason why I have to care about the people I love. You know that very well, Shina."</p>
<p class="calibre1">".........."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's why, she won't stop."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, with a mixed expression of surprise and satisfaction on her face, shifted her gaze to Mimuru, who was still fighting the deformed magical beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from a distance, Mimuru's body was already covered with countless cuts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the wounds are not fatal, the trend of the battle is clear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, she would not stop fighting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Running across the ground as if embodying her firm will, she struggles to protect her friends from the onslaught of evil that is about to befall them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Shina and Mimuru's gazes crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru's mouth hung slightly and she smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a smile that does not seem to be appropriate in a critical situation. But the smile brings Mimuru's voice, which Shina should not have been able to hear, to her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll make you tell me everything when this is over! I won't let you get away with it!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The heat of her best friend that comes through, even if not in words, gently warms her heart and melts the ice that covers it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the spring sunlight melts away the snow that has accumulated over the winter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mimuru ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru came here to be friends with Shina, to be her companion, to get to know her better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, so did I. Well, he was the first one to make a move."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"He was ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's gaze turned from Mimuru and the others to Tom and then to Nozomu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was still crouched down, breathing heavily, as if he was still struggling to catch his breath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, more than anyone else, he was the first to come to Shina's rescue."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He risked himself, risked his life, twice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, that ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget about me, now let's get these all who are fighting to ....... It's not too late. It's not over......."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-223"></a>"...... yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not too late. Shina nodded her head in agreement with Nozomu's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears naturally welled up in the back of her nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is right, Mimuru and the others are not dead yet. They are still fighting for Shina and her family with all their might.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not over yet, as it was 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wiping the tears from her eyes, she stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tom, please."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her frightened, frozen cage inside her heart gently thawed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The melting ice water became new sustenance, giving her a reason to stand up again. The desire to respond to the wishes of these friends now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I'll take care of it."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom nodded at the quiet but strong voice of Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When she looked up again, her face was streaked with tears, but she was staring straight ahead.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew the truth. I knew that I had not yet gotten over that fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The truth was that I was happy. I enjoyed talking with Mimuru and spending time with the three of us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I couldn't say it out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt that if I did, it would diminish my past feelings of helplessness and frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would be admitting to myself that I was still weak and had not overcome my fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fearful mind will not go away. The weakness will not go away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, I don't want to leave it like this. I don't want to repeat the tragedy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I want to protect everyone who protected me and those who kept me safe, and now I want to protect myself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I am surrounded by people I care about. They are fighting for me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru, Tom, and the spirits of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are people who saved me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevin, who is extremely overconfident, and Calanti, who is not very nice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the one person I hated. Nozomu Bountis.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-224"></a>My impression now is ...... that he is a good-natured ..... guy?</p>
<p class="calibre1">At least, I was sure he was too kind compared to the others. I don't think anyone would be able to stretch himself that far to let a person who abused him so much get away. At least I don't think I could.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can understand now the scene that led me to dislike him. I know now that it was definitely not him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The disgust I had felt up to now was suddenly reversed, and an indescribable, sweet and sour feeling came over me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I peeked at him with a sideways glance and saw that he was staring at me with eyes filled with surprise and passion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was overjoyed, and my passionate feelings welled up all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can't show him any more funny outfits. That's why I'm going to .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Raz, you're here, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A friend from childhood. Calling out the name of the spirit who grew up in the Nebula forest with me, I put my hand on my chest and focus deeply, deeply, deeply to remember the connection I once felt.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, I found that a stream of magic, thinner and more ephemeral than a thread, was branching inside my body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully, I followed the thread.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I found myself with a small, almost vanishing fine spirit floating trembling in the palm of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry I didn't notice you ......”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pyuririri……”</p>
<p class="calibre1">A scruffy, yet struggling voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I gently wrapped my hands around the trembling little spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You stood by my side and tried to protect me. All my life, I was scared. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This little friend had not disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though I lost my powers and most of my consciousness, it continued to exist, and it was trying to protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But he overreacted to my fear and nervousness and continued to threaten even his own people as enemies. I was releasing it to make a contract with them, putting my own hostility on my magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I could no longer contract with the spirits, and no one noticed Raz's presence because he was hidden by my magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I poured my magical power into my thinning connection with Razward.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-225"></a>The shaking of the lapis lazuli spirit subsides and its light grows stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Thank you, I'm fine now. ......</p>
<p class="calibre1">All because of my inadequacy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still trapped in the past, they looked only ahead and did not look at the "present moment".</p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought I was moving forward, but I kept stepping on the spot, not realizing what was important.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I had to put an end to that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know I'm like this, but will you still be with me?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next moment, a ball of light popped!</p>
<p class="calibre1">A small bird with long tail feathers appeared, its lapis lazuli-colored wings spreading out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From its chest to its abdomen, it is as white as snow, and as it moves toward the side of its body, the color of its feathers changes to a glossy yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Razward. A small spirit that possesses the power of the three attributes of wind, water, and earth, which is extremely rare among spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"..........."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The resurrected Razward takes my proffered hand and gently gives me a cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, I knew immediately what he meant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in response to my thanks, Rasward squealed, "Rururu!" and he took off from my hand and began to hover around my shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come let's go ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I released my magical power and connected my consciousness to the spirits floating around me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic power that spread to every corner of the branches brought a chilling sensation down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the fear felt by the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fine spirits, whose power is weak, were instinctively frightened by the source element released by that unusual demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toward them, I conveyed my feelings with my magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(It's still scary, isn't it? ....... But that's okay, it's okay to be scared ......) I speak to them gently, as if I were soothing a frightened infant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fear they have is something I have now. So you don't have to throw them away.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXcqMPv/000011.jpg" alt="000011" border="0"></a><br />

<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-227"></a>(But I want to change ...... No, I will change. I take the first step to move forward with this fear)</p>
<p class="calibre1">To change myself from trying to be strong on my own and to be able to protect the people I care about this time around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is why I am going to .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Just a little help, just a little. It's okay if you're scared. You don't have to be strong all of a sudden. ......)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Right here, right now, together, let's all take the first step and become just a little bit stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, as if responding to my call, countless spirits began to gather.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gathered spirits danced around me and Razward, rising and falling like a tornado.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, everyone."</p>
<p class="calibre1">With all my heart, I look ahead, thanking them for answering my call.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is fear. But my mind and body are no longer trapped.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's magic power was released once again, and she was flying through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gazed at the gathering phosphorescent light with eyes as if he were looking at something precious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's feelings were transmitted to the spirits through the magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because many of the spirits are in tune with her heart, even if they cannot hear her voice, their glow and warmth, like that of countless fireflies, convey her wishes even to Nozomu, who watches from a short distance away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf girl who was aware of her cowardice and yet determined to stand up was dignified and breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's amazing ...... how beautiful she is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was struck by this impression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most fascinating thing to him was the strength of the bond that even if it breaks or clashes, it can still be reconnected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What attracted him most of all was the strength of the bond that connects them again, even if it breaks or bumps into each other. It was the preciousness of her who had truly grown in her heart and taken the first step forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, while aware of her escape, showed a courage that the stagnant Nozomu of today does not have.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her thoughts continue to spread through the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-228"></a>She quickly raises her hand as if to ask the gathering spirits for a favor. She points ahead to Mimuru and the others, who continue to desperately stall the black demonic beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom's golem has long since been destroyed, and the expressions on the faces of the other three men are deep with fatigue. They were just being cornered like rats in a battle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the moment Shina pointed at the demon beast, the battle situation suddenly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Raz, everyone!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ground rises, creating a wall separating Mimuru and the demon beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inevitably, Shina and the demon beast faced each other head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trauma of the incident came back to the forefront of her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the bird-shaped spirit, Razward, gently stroked Shina's cheek as if to say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't worry".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's face was tense and her face was stiff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you. Please take care."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina smiles at the encouragement of the spirits who have regained their bond with her, and returns her gaze to the demon beasts again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The black demon beast roared, shaking the ground as it rushed toward Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the beast's rush was blocked by a wall of light that suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wall was as thin as a piece of cloth and looked unreliable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the thin wall of light, despite its fragile appearance, effortlessly received the huge body of the demonic beast and repelled it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gau, grrrrrrrrrrrrr ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's supple fingers glide through the air toward the demon beast that has been flung away, and as if following their trajectory, the Razward flies through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A swirl of phosphorescence overflows. In the next instant, the light barrier instantly transformed its form into countless spears and rushed toward the demonic beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Guuooooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Against the onrushing spears of light, the demon beasts widened its huge mouths, and with a roar, it launched a black sphere. The black roar and the swarm of light spears collide, scattering a roar, smoke, and light from the source around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A wall of light disappears as compensation for the attack.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that the wall of light protecting Shina is gone, the monsters rush toward her again.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-229"></a>However, the demonic beast's rush was once again blocked, this time by something that suddenly came out of the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gagyaaau!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">What burst out of the ground were countless tree roots. The roots, which were layered like a net, caught the rush of the demonic beast head-on, entangled with it, and tightened their huge bodies with tremendous force.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The black demon beast bites into the roots of the tree that are wrapped around its body and begins to bite and shred them with its jaws. The roots of the tree that bound its body were also torn to shreds as the beast struggled to escape its restraints.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the help of the spirits in the area, the demon beast was gradually releasing its restraints.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shina's expression shows no sign of impatience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she runs her finger through the air, a tree root shoots up from the ground again and wraps around the huge jaws of the demonic beast, which opens to release its own restraints, forcing its mouth to close.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Fu......'</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a deep breath, Shina took up her bow and readied an arrow. She squeezes the string and takes aim.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if responding to her will, Razward transforms his body into the source material and assimilates with the arrow she has placed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light begins to fill the arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The glow is far more intense than the engraved arrows she had been using until now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Shina begins to pour her magic power into the arrows, more and more spirits begin to gather around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was no longer a comet, but began to radiate extreme light like the rising sun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gi, ga~a~a~aaaaa"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps intimidated by the blinding light, the demon beast spurts out the source material it has accumulated in its body from its entire body, blowing away its root restraints.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It then recollected the source material it had expelled. The power it has gathered is stored in its mouth, and it begins to draw out power beyond its limits in an attempt to reject the clear death that is sure to be imminent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It reminded me of a sunspot in the air that swallows the stars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An arrow of polar light and a stagnant sunspot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two concentrated forces were finally released.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The comet of polar light and the torrent of jet blackness from the sunspot.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-230"></a>The two collided and fought each other, scattering a vortex of destruction around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kya ā ā!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru and the others scream as they are caught in the aftermath of the collision, destroying the earthen wall created by the spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ku~tsu……"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Grrrrr…… Uoooooon!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two sides were competing, but the tide gradually began to swing in the other' favor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's arrows began to lose its brilliance little by little. On the other hand, the monster's bombardment gained momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is ....... Could it be that it is taking away Shina's spirit power?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tom muttered with a stunned expression. The spirit can use magic power and qi as its own power, but he probably didn't expect the "deformed magical beast" to be able to take away the spirit's power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If this continues, the power of Shina's spirits will be devoured. If this happens, the jet-black blasts will annihilate her and the spirits that have gathered with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The comet begins to be swallowed by the black torrent. At that moment, another comet flew toward the collision point where the extreme forces were colliding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing Shina, who was beginning to be pushed into a position of inferiority, Nozomu forgot the pain that lingered throughout his body and took a step forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrying a memento of his master, he ran, clutching the invisible chains that bound him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If he did not do so, the bond between Shina and the spirits would be severed once again, and this time completely lost as darkness consumed her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu cannot accept this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The girls who made different choices and overcame difficulties than he did. Their lives must be connected at all costs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The heat returns to Nozomu's mind and body, which are still in shackles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain that lingers throughout her body and the fear of using that power. The fierce heart of Nozomu, as if shaking off the chains that entangle him, propels his body forward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hyu, hyu…… ~tsu!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">He wants to hold on to the bonds that are about to be swallowed by the darkness once again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this single-minded determination, Nozomu tears the chains of suppression from his abilities and releases his power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The wound, which had been sealed, opens, and intense pain shoots through his body, but he ignores all warnings from his sense of pain, as if he does not care.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-231"></a>His lungs bleed again and his breathing becomes erratic, but he doesn't care.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What is needed is an attack that exceeds the absorption capacity of the demonic beast. That is why he puts everything he has into a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding the sword in his right hand, he strikes the qi with all his strength and extreme compression. The sword blade begins to creak and scream as so much qi is poured into it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"U ōo ō oooooh!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring his breathing, he takes aim with his left hand and activates his flash step. He dives into the collision point of Shina's arrows and the demon beast's gunfire, and thrusts out his blade or sheath at once, drawing it like a castle bow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Strike through!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Qijutsu - Core Piercing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a combination of "Phantom" and "Dusk Breaker". When the thrusting qi-blade penetrates the opponent, it explodes into countless needles and blasts the opponent from the inside, a technique with extremely high killing power.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The activated "Core Piercing" penetrates the jet-black blasts and further pierces into the mouth of the demon beast, causing it to explode and disperse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The qi blades, bursting into countless needles, pierce the absorption power of the demonic beast as if it were meaningless, gouging out its head and blowing it away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, Shina's arrows, no longer resisting, fly in a straight line like comets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"---- Go"</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in answer to Shina's call, the comet arrow plunged into the scar opened by Nozomu's</p>
<p class="calibre1">"core piercing" and released the power hidden in its body. With a flash of light, it obliterated the beast's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did it, already ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast, which had 80% of its body blown off, showed no signs of revival and collapsed with a sizzling sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's shoulders slumped in relief that the battle was finally over. The sword that had been caught on the tip of his little finger fell to the ground and made a clang sound.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haa ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina exhaled heavily, released her stance, and looked at Nozomu, who was covered in wounds all over his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are covered with wounds every time you fight."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fufufu …… Shina smiles slightly at ......, and Nozomu replies in a sardonic tone, "It can't be helped, can it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two smile at each other naturally. Between them, a small lapis lazuli-colored bird was flying around with the gentle breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-232"></a>"Shina!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned her head to look at the voice calling out to her, and saw Mimuru and the others rushing toward her, waving their hands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina looked around and saw Razward jumping around happily, and the spirits dancing and playing along with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She greets her friends as they run up to her, thankful for the bond she has regained again and for everything that has helped her. With a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Raz. And to everyone"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blue-haired girl's time truly begins to move.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the blessing of the cool forest breeze.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">After defeating the deformed demon beast and returning to Arcazam, Nozomu and the others, dragging their aching bodies, immediately reported to the guild about the black demon beast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, the story was conveyed to the school, and Nozomu and the others had to give a detailed explanation in front of representatives from the school and the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The location was the branch manager's office of the Adventurers' Guild. There, two men were waiting for Nozomu and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The representative of the school side is Jihad Raundel. He was a hero who had played an active role in mankind's counterinsurgency operations during the Great Invasion. He was also a warrior recognized as equivalent to the S rank, which is almost unheard of on the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other was Carlvis. He is the head of the Arcazam branch of the Adventurers' Guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both are key figures in the city and members of the council that practically runs Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the details of the demon beasts we defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina explains on behalf of the entire group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having regained her connection with the spirits and overcome her own trauma, she was not daunted by the presence of the heroes of 20 years ago and the dignitaries of Arcazam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The black demon beast encountered in the Spasim Forest. She explains the situation accurately and smoothly, taking into account the fact that she saw a very similar demon beast in the Nebula Forest 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know what happened. I know what happened, and I'm glad you're okay. I will make sure that the guild and the guard are aware of this matter and the demonic beast, but you are can not to speak of it unnecessarily."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it because this demon beast bears a striking resemblance to the demon beast that destroyed my hometown?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-233"></a>"Yes, the wounds from the great invasion are still deep-rooted. If we unnecessarily reveal the truth and stir up unrest, it will cause chaos."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and the others nodded their heads in agreement with Jihad's words. Although the number of people who have not directly experienced the Great Invasion has increased over the past 20 years, the scars left behind in countries across the continent are still significant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There have been no sightings of such demonic beasts in these forests until now. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate and gather information for a while. We will investigate from many angles, including the magical stones you brought back and the corpses of the demonic beasts you left behind in the forest."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Nozomu and the others defeated the demon beast, it crumbled away like a piece of clay, leaving behind a mess of mangled meat, twisted bones, and a huge magical stone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although some traces of the direwolf remained in the chunks of meat and bones, most of them were distorted and fused together, and they emitted a strong odor, so Tom's magic buried them in the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic stone that came out of the beast this time was of such a high purity and quantity that it could hardly be found on the market, and in exchange for handing it over to the school, Nozomu and the others received money that was a little too high to be called extra income.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the guild's evaluation points were greatly increased, and Shina was promoted to rank A, while Nozomu was promoted to rank C.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, it was a hush-money payment for the incident, but for Nozomu, it was a big step forward, as he would now be free to enter Spasim's forest without any repercussions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have one question. Do you know about this demon beast?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina asks Jihad a question that goes a step further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A question that, under normal circumstances, he would not have answered. However, even Shina could not back down on this matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina and Jihad's gazes collide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He stares at her for a moment, as if he, too, is aware of Shina's situation as an elf, and then exhales quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We don't know everything about ....... There are too many uncertainties about these monsters. But there have been several sightings during the Great Invasion and later during the Fructus operation, which resulted in battles with the Cremazone Imperial Army, which was part of the Allied Forces at the time."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did they defeat it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, with a lot of casualties, somehow."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demon beast that fought against the Cremazone Imperial Army disintegrated and disappeared after the battle, just as it did this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-234"></a>The only thing they had in common was a black body surface that emitted a miasma-like air and countless red eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Its name is Abyss Grief. It is an unidentified demonic beast whose ecology has not been clarified at all. However, it is speculated that it may have something to do with the Great Invasion."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad looked over at Nozomu and the others. The intimidating gaze of the man made everyone in the room gasp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once again, I want to reiterate to all of you that you are not to speak of this matter to any of other."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jihad reminded those present.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had to be very careful because of the content.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the very least, he had to talk to the council, the guilds, and the security forces, and be ready to deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, Nozomu and the others had no intention of causing a panic because of their own fault.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the conversation was concluded and Nozomu and the others left the branch manager's office, two women were waiting for them in the corridor of the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they saw that Nozomu and the others had come out, they ran up to them with serious expressions on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun, are you all right~?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu, I heard that you were attacked by a demon beast that was a survivor for elimination quest ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The people waiting for him were Irisdina and Anri. Apparently, they were listening to what he had to say about this one incident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying to reassure them of his concern, Nozomu smiled back at them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It’s okay. I just needed to tell you a little about the demon beast I encountered in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But~~ you got hurt, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, there is no problem. I just tore a few muscles all over my body and injured my lungs</p>
<p class="calibre1">......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The blood drained from their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've got a problem! Anri-sensei, get a doctor right away!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I'll take you to Norn right away!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"N~no, no need for it. The wound itself is already healed and ...... is closed!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-235"></a>Anri picked up Nozomu, who was in a panic, and started to run. She was probably using qijutsu, or perhaps she was using some kind of qiatsu, as she blasted off at a speed that would be hard to believe she was carrying a single person on her back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Irisdina was about to run after Anri, someone grabbed her hand and stopped her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Kevin who grabbed Irisdina's hand. Irisdina turned around with a skeptical look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is it Kevin? I'm in a bit of a hurry."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, I won't take up too much of your time. Irisdina, do you know about his 'power'?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence falls between them. Kevin's eyes are shining brightly, and Irisdina replies with a cold look in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you know, what is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"... No, what its. I've taken care by him. Tell him I will pay him back."</p>
<p class="calibre1">After saying this, Kevin maturely let go of Irisdina's hand and turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While frowning at his words, which were strangely conscious of Nozomu, Irisdina was curious about Anri who took Nozomu away and followed him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Kevin steps in front of Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina Yuriel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I just wanted to apologize. I'm sorry I put your pride on hold until now."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes widened in surprise as Kevin bowed deeply. Next to him, Calanti was surprised at the leader's sudden action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surprising, isn't it? How could the proud leader of the Silver Wolf tribe bow his head ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, I'm sorry about that."</p>
<p class="calibre1">'Hey, why did you poke at me like that?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The flock has its roles. There are those who lead, those who fight, and those who take care of the newborns. Each one must fulfill his or her role in order for the flock to survive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a characteristic of the werewolf tribe to live in family groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They basically do not settle down in large groups like people do in countries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They hunt and gather as a family group, and in times of war, the representatives of the family gather together to prepare for battle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the roles of each person in the family are clearly defined.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-236"></a>As the patriarch, the one who unites the family, the one who hunts and takes the prey, the one who processes the prey, the one who makes the tools, the one who builds and maintains the house. And .......</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I thought you were the one who gives birth. Elves who have been reduced in number. To sustain their race. So I thought you were not the one who should be in Arcazam."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"That' s none of your business."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, it is. But I'm sure there are elves out there who would say that, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, but ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know. You were a much greater and stronger woman than I thought you were. It' s a complete defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in distress, Kevin raises his hands in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was wondering if you are alright? You've been using your powers and abilities together in a reckless way."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I would like to say that everything is fine, but I am afraid that is not the case. I've been consuming my energy too much. I won't be able to do even practical classes properly for a while ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">He lowered his raised hand, clenched and opened his fist several times, and suddenly looked into Shina's face with a meaningful smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, if you want, will you be my wife?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What....? Wait, leader!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calanti shouts loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have a fiancée, but you're a great woman. You' re strong-willed, you don't flirt, and you face adversity with aplomb. You're my kind of girl ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's not."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kukuku, I guess."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gururuuru ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite being cut off from his bashed-out confession, Kevin laughs heartily and amusedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, behind him, Calanti bared her teeth and snarled at Shina, who had been one-sidedly confessed to by Kevin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget what I just said. See you later."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The young leader of the Silver Wolf tribe waved his hand in a light tone as he walked away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calanti, who was still wary and unsatisfied, reluctantly followed after the leader.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mimuru and Tom, who are left behind, smile dryly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haha, let's go home then."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-237"></a>"I'm sorry, I still have some things to do. You two can go home first."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay, but what's the matter?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I'm still a little ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's crisp and clean expression from earlier collapses, and a puzzled look appears on her face. Mimuru and Tom smile at the vermilion color on her cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, ah, that's right. I understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good luck!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">With her two friends waving at her, Shina starts walking in the opposite direction from where Kevin and her friends were headed. Leaving the guild, she headed north down the main street. The sun was shining brightly in their direction.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">†</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was abducted in a fast blow-up and thrown into the infirmary, but was released as soon as it was confirmed that his injuries had healed. Incidentally, Anri, who was blasted through the city, is in the process of being lectured by Norn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hah, so much has happened in the last few days ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving the infirmary, he proceeded toward his dormitory with a sideways glance at the school building at twilight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been a very intense few days. The escape and battle with the demon beasts, and the release of the ability suppression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the leaden, heavy fatigue, Nozomu's expression was radiant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was awesome ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A spirit magic that comes back to life in his head. It was different from Tiamat's violent, force like an earthquake or a storm, but a gentle power reminiscent of a cool breeze. The radiance emitted by those whose hearts were truly connected was very intense.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Above all, it was the moment when a once lost bond is reconnected. For Nozomu, who is now aware of his stagnation, it is too dazzling, and at the same time, something to be envied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nozomu-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's eyes widened involuntarily when he heard a voice suddenly call out to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was Shina, a little out of breath and blushing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The person he had just recalled. Nozomu's heart surged at the appearance of someone who was different from Irisdina, but who he had felt a kind of longing for.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shina, ~san? What brings you here?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I just wanted to talk to you. Would you mind if I took a moment of your time?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-238"></a>As she speaks to him calmly, the icicle-ice-coldness that had been there is gone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, she is clothed in a warm air reminiscent of the sunlight filtering through the trees in spring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, light gathers next to her and a small lapis lazuli-colored bird appears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, is this bird ......?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm, looks like Raz wanted to talk to Nozomu-kun, too."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The little spirit, Razward, flapped his wings as he approached Nozomu, and began chirping in a cool tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chui, chu, chuchu!"（Yo! You've done a great favor! But I'm surprised a human could make it this far!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Raz, you have no respect for your benefactor."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chichu! Chuchuchu!" ( It''s good! You and this brother are going to be acquainted with each other for a long time, so it's better to avoid unnecessary attention to each other!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even after twenty years, you still have a bad mouth ......."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite its chirpy cry, the words uttered by the little spirit are strangely light for a spirit that is the embodiment of mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed that this Razward was a spirit with a personality not unlike that of his contractor, Shina.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, Shina seemed a little taken aback by Razward's overly light tone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, on the other hand, had a subtle, indescribable expression on his face as he watched Razward and Shina continue their conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina and Razward tilted their heads at Nozomu's lackluster response.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Um, what are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chui?” (What? )</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps you don't know what Raz is talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu nodded at Shina's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's funny. If a spirit tries to communicate its voice of its own volition, even if it can't speak, you should be able to hear it ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because spirits are pure energy bodies constructed from source elements, they do not use voice or pheromone communication methods as humans and other ordinary creatures do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They communicate by speaking directly to the soul of the person they wish to converse with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a kind of telepathy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, for some reason, Nozomu was unable to communicate by telepathic communication, even though the spirit had the will to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-239"></a>"Chu ~~, chuchuchu. Chuichui! (Hmmm, you haven't noticed? You're quite an interesting brother, aren't you, with the technique you used to pierce the body of that demon beast?)"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Razward stopped at Nozomu's shoulder with a ton and looked into his face with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His eyes, reminiscent of glasswork, were fixed on Nozomu, as if he could see right through them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gulped at the little bird's meaningful gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, who was watching them from the side, also tilted her head at her friend's strange behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Raz, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chu ―― i, chuchu, chun, chun! (No, it's nothing. By the way, brother, do you have a mate?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Raz, what are you asking?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina looks at Nozomu suspiciously as Razward begins to chirp in her ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu, who cannot hear spirits, has no idea what the little lapis lazuli bird is saying, but to the bewildered Nozomu's dismay, Rasward begins to chatter rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chun Chun, Chu, Chui Chui ... (As you may know, Shi jo is a very thorough person. As a big brother, I can't leave it to a half-hearted man ....)."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Shina-san, is he ...... okay? What's he talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who's you call big brother? I don't remember having an older brother like you. I was the one who took care of you when you were in the forest."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Shina-san, is he ...... okay? What's he talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Never mind that chattering little bird, it' s just chirping for no reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chuchunchuichui, chu <i class="calibre4"> chuchu, chunchui…… chu! (Cih</i>, I knew it, you didn't hear me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But, Shi jo, it's not for no reason. Are you ashamed of yourself?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next moment, a vivid sight played in Shina's mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the image that Razward had sent through the pass of the contract.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment she saw it, Shina's face turned red like a boiled octopus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"<i class="calibre4">Tsu! …… </i>Tsu! <i class="calibre4">Tsu</i>tsu~tsu!......! !"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Eh? Shina-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu was flustered by Shina, who suddenly started screaming in agony with her mouth clamped shut.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What in the world is going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's questions aside, Razward, who was probably the source of the problem, was sighing on Nozomu's shoulder and ruffling his long tail feathers with a look of exasperation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-240"></a>"Chi~ichuchunchu…… chu? Chuichui! Dji~u~u ――――― i! (I knew it. You' re just embarrassed. Why do you care? Your parents did the same thing ...... what the heck ...... hey!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gue e e e e!)"</p>
<p class="calibre1">A white hand grabs the tiny bird in an eagle's grip, fingers tightening around it., and slender fingers squeeze the tiny bird.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A squeaking sound like a wrung-out rag echoes through the air, and a muddled, paint-soaked cry echoes through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina, looking like a fiendish red devil, swung her arm over her head and threw her friend into the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Razward, who had been thrown away, flew in a straight line over the school building and vanished into thin air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's cheeks were pulled back in a cold sweat at the sight that seemed so far removed from reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, um, Shina-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha, ha, never mind ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, but ...... yes, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu raises his hands in surrender to Shina, who stares at him with teary eyes and red cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, That's it. I' m already so weirdly aware of it because of Raz. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering the latter line in a whisper so as not to be heard, Shina turned her face away to cover her embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While she puts her hand on her cheek to hide her hot cheek, her gaze flickers and turns to Nozomu in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing gazes. Shina's cheeks, which she hid, turn an even deeper shade of red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, are you sure you're okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah, yeah! I'm fine, I'm fine!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Placing her hand on her chest, Shina takes a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once, twice, three times. Little by little, the rising heat returns to the depths of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, what did you want to talk about?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wanted to thank you. I hadn't said it properly yet. ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The smile that naturally appeared on his face made Nozomu's heart jump.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was not the slightest hint of the cold-heartedness she had displayed when they first met, and she exuded an air of such charm that one could not help but look away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The warmth that had returned to Shina's frozen chest after the loss of everything was her true smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="calibre_link-241"></a>"You don't need.... no, it's nothing"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, the only reason they were able to reconnect was because they acted on their own initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu himself recognized that he had merely bought the necessary time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, you saved me. If it weren't from you, I wouldn't have even had the chance to exchange words with Mimuru and the others once again."</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Shina shook her head and clearly denied Nozomu's words.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shina's eyes were clear as day as she looked back at him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks to you, I was able to protect my best friend. I was able to reunite with my friends. I didn't lose ...... of myself."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu's consciousness stiffened as if sucked into her straight gaze and the words of gratitude she offered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you so much ....."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mouth relaxes naturally, and the rancor that we've been bickering about for so long melts away like sugar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm glad you're ...... at least ..."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu and Shina laugh at each other. A gentle breeze flows between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"But still, how could you try to deal with that demon beast twice by yourself? You really are a pushover, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu scratches his cheek shyly, and Shina brings her face close to his as if peeking in and deepens her smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am. Also, I'm sorry. I was wrong about you."</p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that's okay. It's good enough that you understand."</p>
<p class="calibre1">A peaceful time. A sense of connection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The feeling of warmth and heat, reminiscent of a winter fireplace, naturally brought a smile to the couple's faces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the midst of this peaceful time, Shina's expression suddenly turned serious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nozomu tilts his head in wonderment, she slowly opens her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There' s one more thing I have to tell you. What I saw, Lisa-san and the others. What I realize now because of ......"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nozomu gasps in surprise at the sudden mention of Lisa's name. But his expression quickly changes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, a few seconds later. His eyes widen at the words Shina utters.</p>
