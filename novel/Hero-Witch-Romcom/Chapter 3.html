<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Artificial Hero</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hero Creation Project.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a large-scale project led by the sage, Alicia Edwards. (T/N: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">アリシア゠エドワーズ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plan was to produce a hero capable of killing the Witch of Calamity and send them out to the world as an agent of God. In truth, it was just the church&#8217;s attempt to gain more power by gaining the achievement of killing the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the plan ran into various difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, gathering enough children that had talent for exorcism was difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they managed to gather a hundred children from all over the continent, not many of them managed to survive. Some of them had their bodies broken down from the physical enhancements used for the project. Some of them had their spirits crushed because they couldn’t endure the side effects of the drugs used for the project. Some of them were ruthlessly killed by the demons during their training. Some of them were afflicted with mental traumas they couldn’t recover from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, ninety nine of the children became useless and Sage Alicia almost gave up on the project. But one particular boy persisted through. He managed to grow rapidly and eventually managed to achieve the goal the sage had set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the boy was originally an uncultured young orphan, Sage Alicia taught the boy everything he needed to know to be a man worthy of being God’s chosen hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She decreed to him.</span></p>

<p><b>‘Vanquish evil, save others.’</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">God brought salvation to the world where people mourned because of the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The church announced that He had chosen a hero to drive the evil witch away and save the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the name of said hero was Grey Handlet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was the church’s masterpiece, an existence that was created only to kill the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re such a sinful man, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji, who was lying his cheek on the table in front of me, said that in disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want you, of all people, to tell me that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just finished recounting what happened with Hina last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi oi, normal childhood friends wouldn’t lay down in the same bed, under the same blanket, when they became high school students, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the case of a pot calling the kettle black.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You misunderstood something. Yes, we laid down under the same blanket, but she left before we did anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Elaborate on the ‘anything else’ part.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, we’re like family, we won’t be doing what you’re thinking about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what </span><b>you</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> think, she might think otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Or else, why would she even get into the blanket in the first place?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t need to prove anything to him. Yes, sometimes, I was conscious of Hina as a girl, but at the end of the day, she was like a sibling to me and I believed that she also thought the same as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;This guy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Shinji looked at me with a disgusted look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to beat the cr*p out of you so badly, right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not only you’re playing with Hina’s heart, you’re playing with Shiina Mai’s heart too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you on about? I did none of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are all the beautiful girls flocking around you? This isn’t fair!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t want to hear that from you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged his soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me set this straight, I’m more popular than you and I look better than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, shut the f**k up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, why are all the prettiest looking girls flocking around you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I furrowed my brows. What the hell was this guy even talking about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll spell it out for you. In our class, Shiina Mai, Kirishima Hina and Shindou Yuuka, then there’s that first year, your co-worker, Kawasaki Saya. They’re all top tier beauties and I wouldn’t doubt it if someone were to tell me that they’re actually idols.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How the hell do you even know about my co-worker…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was just creepy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well then again, Kawasaki went to this school too, so I guess it wouldn’t be strange for him to know her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s just say that my information network is wide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He waved his hand, told me that he wanted to get some drinks and went outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let him go without saying anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was currently lunch break and I had already finished my lunch, but there was still time to spare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Since that was the case, should I just play a game?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my phone and opened a certain RPG game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The game felt strangely realistic to me because it was similar to my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to my memories, I had a way to enjoy the game on my own despite the differences in setting compared to my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the school forbade us to bring our phones, but they didn’t actually enforce it strictly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if you were to use it during the classes, they would confiscate it, but if you were to use it during the lunch break like this, no one would reprimand you for it. In fact, some of my classmates were watching something on their phones for a while now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I decided to play a game today but, sadly, I couldn’t concentrate on playing because of a certain someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. You like novels, huh? I read some famous ones sometimes too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes… I could read novels on my own, so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch was talking with Hina and I was listening silently to their conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Especially light novels… I love them… A-Ah, sorry, do you know what a light novel is? Y-You probably don’t know, right? I-It’s a novel with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">-esque artstyle on it… N-No, that’s not it… H-How should I describe it… U-Um, sorry, I rambled on…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch started rambling on her own, but in the middle, she started stuttering and her voice faded little by little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina looked at her with a wry smile and said, “You can take your time if it’s that difficult to explain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch only laughed shyly in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to remind myself that this girl was the Witch of Calamity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the conversation, though I didn’t know if I could call it as one, continued. Hina managed to skillfully handle the witch’s poor communication skill, as expected of her. If it was any other person, they’d left her the moment she started her light-speed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">otaku</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Hina to take care of the witch yesterday and she said that she was planning to do it anyway. But in the end, no matter how much Hina tried to accommodate her, the situation won’t improve if her communication skill doesn&#8217;t improve anytime soon. This situation was troubling…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope that the witch would be able to find someone she could trust in this life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be sad if she were to live under the assumption that everyone in this world was her enemy, like she did in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was having difficulties keeping myself awake in classes, everything had ended for the day before I knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I didn’t catch a cold, I decided to come to school, but my condition still wasn’t great. Though, I still could do my part-time job, no problem. Hina would probably scold me again, but it wasn’t like I’m torturing myself or anything, so it shouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike my previous life, my current body was more fragile, but I only needed to adjust to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That aside,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, Witch, what the hell were you up to yesterday?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I inquired her about the familiar, the witch, who had her head propped up on the table, slowly raised her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? Are you mad that I found out you’ve been flirting around with a first year?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who’s flirting?! You know that’s not what I’m talking about! Why were you stalking me?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my duty as your nemesis to stalk you to learn of your weaknesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you stop doing that, please?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my complaint, the witch yawned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Wait, were you sleeping? Girl, you’re just transferred in, listen to the class properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Unlike you, I’m smart. Even if I slack off a little, I won’t get into any trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch rubbed her forehead and asked me,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, why are you bugging me? Is it about the curse again? I told you to do it once every three days, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind if we’re doing it every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No can do. I know that it takes a lot to even attempt to dispel that kind of curse from my body. If I don’t give you time to rest, you’ll break down. I mean, yesterday took a toll on you, didn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right, my body still felt uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like she said, I became like this because I was treating her curse yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, this much fatigue was nothing. It wouldn’t hinder my daily life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I was really worried about her condition. The curse seemed to erode more part of her soul compared to back in our previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it really okay for us to take our time like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is everything going to be alright?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I keep treating you, will you eventually get better?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She responded to my question with silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t see her expression from where I stood because she was looking downwards. After a while, she asked with an emotionless voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What if I say no?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch gradually raised her face. The face that was staring at me looked like she was about to break down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do if I tell you that what you’re doing is nothing more than first aid?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, then I’ll find a way to help you for real this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What if I tell you that a way to help me exists and it requires you to sacrifice your lifespan?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just that? Well, I don’t like the idea, but if that’s what it takes to save the world, yeah sure, I’ll do it. I thought it’d be something big, but if it’s just that… How are you going to do it, though? What kind of magic will you use?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t answer me for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Witch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Idiot, that was a rhetorical question. Things aren’t that simple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Oh well…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forget about it, get away from me quickly. We’ll do the treatment again the day after tomorrow, so don’t talk to me until then. I don’t want to see your face everyday, it’s an eyesore.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t bring my face into this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She snorted and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she seemed to be in a bad mood. Then again, that was her default state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Guess I’ll go home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked out of the classroom and went to the parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like yesterday, it was still boiling hot outside. The intense sunlight was burning my skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to fan myself with my hand, but it did nothing to reduce the heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you going to work again today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was on my way, Hina called me out from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hina?! I only have a four hour shift today, so I’ll be fine!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had already changed into her club uniform. Her smooth, juicy thighs were laid bare for me to see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you freaking out?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She furrowed her brows in suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I was scared of her anger, I was flustered when she called out to me and that made my voice crack when I answered her question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever. So you didn’t take a day off?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, if I were to suddenly do that, it’ll trouble the manager…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to increase the manager’s worries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Kawasaki decided to take a break, we became more short-staffed than we already were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Please don’t overdo it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Don’t worry, I won’t do something that I’m unable to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t really understand what Hina was trying to say to me, but I knew that she was worried about me. I mean, I’ve never pushed myself too hard. I knew my own limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current me was merely an ordinary high school boy. There was a lot I couldn’t do, so I only did what I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry too much about me, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stroked her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she went quiet after that. Come to think of it, when was the last time I patted her head?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;W-Well, I won’t worry too much about you. You’re uselessly strong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She averted her gaze away with a ‘hmph’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by uselessly strong? Are you mocking me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I meant what I meant. All those strengths and you didn’t even join any clubs. You’re just a lump of muscle now, you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh shut it! Oi, don’t punch me in the stomach!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, your abs are as amazing as always…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to get her away from my stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it about time for your club activities to start? Why are you dawdling here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right! Oh cr*p! I’m going to be late!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina left the parking lot in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a rowdy girl as always. Thanks to her, my days didn’t feel boring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I felt a presence behind me, so I turned around to face them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a black haired girl hiding behind a tree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she trying to hide or something? What the hell was she doing, anyway?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Whatever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was actually trying to hide, I guess I should just let her be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got on my bike and started pedaling leisurely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along the way, I passed through the residential area, wide paddy fields, various roadways and a park filled with children energetically playing around. It took five minutes for me to get to where I was from school. At that moment, I stopped my bike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…And heard the sound of a bike falling from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I could see a black haired girl trying to hide her face behind a pole. There was an upside down bike near her feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oi, are you okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t expect something like this would happen. I ran to the witch’s side in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she had been following me from school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she seriously think that I wouldn’t notice her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing, even?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hid her face with her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, you, know not… Go…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, no.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed at the witch, who muttered such dumb things with a fake voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, even if it isn’t you, I’ll still help anyone who fells off a bike like this. They could be injured and all. C’mon, let me take a look at you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reluctantly, she revealed her pouting face to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? You want to say something to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fixed the witch’s fallen bike’s position and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, your stalking aside, there’s no way I won’t have something to say to you after this kind of thing happened…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch suddenly crouched down, trying to hide her bleeding knee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, you hurt yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lucky for you, the park is nearby. We can wash it off there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you, this is nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> nothing. This is not our previous life, don’t make light of small wounds like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could fix it with healing magic back then, but that simply wasn’t the case anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I carried the bicycle to the park with the witch following me behind. She was unusually docile this time. Probably because she was embarrassed since she hurt herself after failing an attempt to tail me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, we couldn’t leave her wound like that, so I helped her to wash the soil off it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t feel a thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression didn’t change, so I’d assume that her words were true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, it’s clean. Let me put some disinfectant on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you carrying that around?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no harm in carrying it around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, but why? Normal people wouldn’t do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Well, whatever, a useful thing is useful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You never change, Hero.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you stop calling me that? I don’t want people to treat me like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I should stop calling her ‘witch’ from now on too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it matter? It’s just the two of us here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a cough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I don’t want to call you by name. I refuse it with every fiber of my being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I understood her feelings. We were enemies after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like us to be overly familiar with each other. After all, we weren’t in that kind of relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though our status is different now, our relationship stays the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, you’re not a hero anymore. You’re just a normal high school student. There&#8217;s no reason for you to help other people anymore. Are you still disillusioned from the fact that you used to be a hero in your past life? Is that why you’re doing all this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laughed at her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is just a small thing, not really something I’d consider as ‘helping’. Besides, giving first aid to someone who needs it is a normal thing to do, everyone in this country does it. This is the best thing I can do considering the circumstances too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The best thing you can do, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What’s with your tone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch stared right into my eyes. Her tone sounded like she saw right through me and that felt unpleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could ask her what was on her mind, she opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><b>“I knew it. You’re still thinking that you have to help other people even when you’re reincarnated in another world. Even though you don’t have your power anymore.”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to refute her words, but I couldn’t manage to say anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe her words were true… All this time, I haven’t been thinking about it much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to help people because that was the right thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in that world and in this world, that was always the case for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is there a problem with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it wrong for me to do the right thing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I furrowed my brows as I asked her that. The witch just looked at me with a gaze that looked as if she was pitying me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Your mind is still trapped in that world. And, like in that world, the word ‘Hero’ is engraved to your soul like a curse. That’s why you have that crazy obsession to help other people around you… Don’t you realize that you’re an anomaly to people in this world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crazy obsession? You’re exaggerating–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at yourself and say that again. Only lunatics would help other people without minding their own condition. Yes, there are kind people who’d help other people around them too, but they wouldn’t do more than necessary. They’d only do it to the best of their abilities. Yes, </span><b>to the best of their abilities</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you realize that your standard is distorted? I thought that being reincarnated in another world would fix it, but it seems like you’re a lost cause.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t understand what she was talking about and what was the reason why she said all this to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was raised to live as a hero, so it couldn’t be helped that my standard would be different from normal people’s standard. After all, I was born to be different from normal people. That was all there to it, nothing worth discussing at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re right, helping people is the right thing to do, but the thing is, </span><b>you don’t have to do it</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. That&#8217;s common sense, that’s what normal people believe… Only you would think that helping people is something that someone must do… I’ll ask you once again, you realized that you aren’t a hero anymore, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch lowered her gaze and stared at my leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday, when you helped that girl, you hurted your leg, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied as I flopped my leg slightly. I could still feel the pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normal people wouldn’t think of doing something as reckless as you, but you did that without hesitation. I’m sure that you’ll still do it even if you know that you’re going to suffer more injuries than a mere sprained ankle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I have a good reason to do it. If she were to actually fall, her head would bump into a table. Since I could prevent it, I did it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to someone’s life, a sprained ankle was nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even a child knew that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess you’re right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if she could read my thoughts, the witch continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You made the right decision at that time, but I’m sure that you’ll do the same even if you know that she’ll only get a few scratches.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Stop talking as if you know me that well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I know. How many times did you think we tried to kill each other in that world?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch smiled widely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will still do it and will continue to do the same thing even if you have to pay with your life as the price. </span><b>Just like back then</b><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will still do it and will continue to do the same thing even if you have to pay with your life as the price. </span><b>Just like back then</b><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard the witch’s words, it felt like she was foreseeing something that would definitely happen in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Words were the most basic form of curse. Even without the existence of witchcraft, words had been used by humans to curse one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you trying to curse me with those words?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a jab at her, trying to brush it off lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. In fact, I don’t need to. You’ve been cursed since a long time ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the witch took my words seriously.</span></p>
<p><b>Vanquish evil, help others</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words were what started everything in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess her words were true. I was cursed since a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that was the case, heroes were a cursed existence to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve always tried to live up to people’s expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve always behaved according to Sage Alicia’s will.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If it’s the hero, he’ll definitely save us!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Our hero, Grey-sama, the God’s chosen, will be able to drive evil away from our lands!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He’s the hero, he’ll never abandon us!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Endure! Stay strong! Grey will definitely come to our aid!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve always faithfully acted according to the role that was assigned to me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Sorry, I kept you waiting.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s alright now.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m here to help.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No need to cry, I’m here to protect you.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Do not worry, I’ll be back.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’ll do my best to protect your smile.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I had no regrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it was the right thing to do. It was satisfying to see the smile of the people that I saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I was unable to live like a normal person as the price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, I was born with this power to devote myself to the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my fate to be on the battlefield. It was inevitable that my body would be smeared with mud, sweat and blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was why, when I was reborn into this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had lost the reason for my existence as I was no longer the hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the same time, I lost my sense of purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I voiced my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong with wanting to help others?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a step forward and stared intently at the witch’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what if I want to help people? Is it wrong?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, the witch crumpled her face, as if she was hurting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You understood nothing, did you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch turned her gaze down as she muttered that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look in her eyes annoyed me. It was as if she could understand everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to ask you one more time, witch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like I didn’t understand what she was trying to say. I knew that there were truths in her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn’t know the intent behind her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I spread my hands open and asked her once again,</span></p>
<p><b>“Is there something wrong with what I’m trying to do?”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vanquish evil, save others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fight for justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t as easy as it sounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were many times when I had tried my best but, ultimately, I failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than once, I sacrificed others for the greater good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You could call me a hypocrite, arrogant, liar and self-righteous person, I wouldn’t deny it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding other people’s fate on my own, acting like I was a God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that the burden was heavy for me to carry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the role of a hero was too heavy of a burden for a single person to carry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that my actions had saved countless people’s lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve protected those people’s smiles and saved them from tragedies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This unworthy back of mine carried the will of the people of that world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unworthy back of none other than me…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero, Grey Handlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wouldn’t reject the result of my own actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it was the result of a curse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;With the way I am now, I can’t do much. Still, I want to help others to the best of my abilities! Is that wrong? Is that the wrong thing to do?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. You’re wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On what ground—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hero… No, Grey… In your previous life, have you ever smiled?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t remember any instance when I was smiling back in my previous life. At least, not at the top of my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you… Of course I did!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you realize that now you’re smiling a lot more than back then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch, probably still feeling hurt because of her wounds, sat down on the bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was really surprised when I saw you smiling. I was glad for you. Finally, you could smile without a care in the world, but… It was a year ago, wasn’t it? The time when your memories awakened… Ever since then, you have become more like you were in your previous life…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch continued to speak in monotone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate it, I can’t stand seeing you becoming like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you care? It has nothing to do with you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s funny to hear those words coming from your mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were sharp, as if she was trying to pierce my heart with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Try to think deeply about the words you said just now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Warm breeze brushed against my cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I realized, sweats had started flowing from my cheeks and fell into the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been reincarnated, but you’re still bound by a curse. You know you don’t need to help other people anymore, right? Live your own life, seek your own happiness, why can’t you do that instead?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my chest tightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I realized that the person in front of me was the Witch of Calamity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My own happiness? What the hell was she on about? I was happy enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the power to help people and they believed in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People around me and they said that they loved me, if that wasn’t happiness, then what was?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You tried to save everyone but yourself. You called yourself a hero, you tried to bring happiness to others, but you can’t even bring it to yourself… That’s the thing I hate the most about you… That’s the reason why I hate you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch ended her words just like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she had no intention of continuing this talk, she walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those were the only words I could say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she was kind. I knew that she said those words sincerely to help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that didn’t mean I could accept her words just like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? Do you have something to say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I took another step toward her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My phone rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have to check to know why it was ringing. It was about time for my shift to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent too much time talking to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t ignore this as I’d be late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s goodbye then, hero. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch walked away without saying another word. It really seemed that she had no intention to talk with me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gait was still unsteady because of her injured leg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Your bike is still here, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl was as hopeless as always. I ignored her and answered the phone. As expected, it was from the manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello? Yes, I’m sorry, I had a business to take care of! Yes, I’ll be there quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was apologizing like that, the witch came back, took her bike away and left. I could see her face was red up to her ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she left, only the sound of cicadas could be heard in the park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch once said to me that the most powerful curse wasn’t witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It required no chant, mana nor preparation. The effect of the curse wasn’t visible to the senses, one wouldn’t feel pain or discomfort because of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, it ate away the mind of the one who was afflicted with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the worst of it all, said person wouldn’t be aware of its existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You are the same as me, don’t you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably, those words she said to me were her true feelings. She just wanted me to be happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably, she was concerned about me, that was why she said all that to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, even if her words were true, that my way of life was wrong…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as she still did the same thing as me, I had no intention of admitting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*Jingles*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My thoughts were broken by the sound of the bell, signaling someone’s arrival to the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome— Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost dropped the cup I was holding when I saw the person in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? You look off today, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kawasaki. She placed her hands on her hips and started to scold me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-My bad…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just distracted because I had a lot to think about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, you’re overdoing yourself. If you’re not feeling well, take a leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, if I do that, we’ll be even more short-staffed than we already are…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, I thought you won’t have any shifts until after the exam?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me yesterday that it would be her last day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she pouted her lips and muttered shyly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The manager is trying to get more senior employees to work on more shifts and since I’m one of them… Well, I can’t say no, even though it’s troublesome…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she was worried about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess it was natural. I wasn’t a hero anymore. No one expected me to do everything. People wouldn’t put their complete faith in me without any reason anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They would probably treat my attempt to help them as unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just trying to make it harder for you to make money, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Don’t thank me for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’ll hold a grudge on you for it, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s too far! At least, be a little grateful!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tapped my cheeks a little with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to get myself together. At least, I shouldn’t make her worry about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just a little sleepy, don’t worry, Kawasaki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouldn’t let my personal problems get in the way of work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since they paid me for this, it was my responsibility to do my job properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, I should do my best for the money. To do that, I need to concentrate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath and analyzed my physical condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little tired, but this much should be nothing to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My current body was far less capable compared to my previous one, but I could do nothing but deal with it. I had been working out to hone my body and the effect of all those efforts had begun to appear. I managed to correct the ‘error’ in my body, little by little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I knew that I could never become like I was back in the day.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You’re no longer a hero.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch’s words flashed through my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It repeated in my mind over and over like a curse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m aware of that, more than anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand could only reach those within the reach of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, no one would even try to reach their hands out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was my current reality and I accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still… The height where I stood… The reach of these arms of mine during that time… Compared to back then, my current self seemed pathetic. That was why, I kept chasing after the illusion that was my former self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though no one asked for my help</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though this was a world that didn’t need my help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D**n it… Focus! Stop thinking!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook off the vision of the witch in my mind and tried to concentrate on my job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after I was done with work and the darkness of the night became deeper, the insects still buzzed energetically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was barely any other sound in the neighborhood. I looked outside the window. I could see the surrounding houses were lit, showing that there were people living in those houses. Hina’s room next door was also lit. Was she still studying?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The coffee in my hand tasted too sweet for my taste. It seemed like I put too much sugar in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tonight was cool for a summer night and I could go to sleep without turning the AC on if I wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed the textbooks and notebooks spread out throughout my desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to study for the exam. Honestly, I didn’t need to worry about getting red marks, but I felt a little worried about the witch who had just transferred in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she was an honor student, but if the scope of the exam was different compared to her previous school, she would be bound to have a hard time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should summarize the main points and give it to her later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t a great student, but anyone could study if they put their mind into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stretching my body, I sat down on the chair and started studying for the first subject, math.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my hand stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Were the witch’s words true? Was my current action just something that was born from a curse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this time, was it true that I did nothing but chase after the shadow of my former self?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that I had been following my own will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to think about it calmly, there was no reason whatsoever for me to help her as she was my nemesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…If this action was the result of a curse then, where did my will, my dream and my happiness go? It was exactly like what the witch said to me then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the church’s announcement permeating through the entire continent, everyone was skeptical about it. No one believed that the hero would ever be able to defeat the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, my first mission was to gain the trust of the people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded to people’s calls for help and defeated the various demons that swarmed around the continent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did the same thing over and over again to the point that people recognized me as a real hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only later that I found out that this was a part of my training to fight against the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Golden hair, clear blue sky and a pure white sword… Everything matches the rumors… Are you the hero who was chosen to defeat me or something like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t expect to meet the witch in that kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Underneath the silver hair, there were a pair of bewitching red eyes and a face so beautiful that it could make anyone have their heads fall over heels. Below that, were a well-proportioned body and a pair of beautiful thighs peeking over from her damaged clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her features matched the description of the evil witch from the rumors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you the Witch of Calamity, Cerys Flores?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How rude of you, answering my question with another one. Why don’t you answer my question first before asking?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re right. Yes, I am the chosen hero, Grey Handlet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, I’ll introduce myself. The strongest witch and magic user, the person who plunged the world into a disaster, the one who laughs at the pitiful scream of the weak! The one and only, Cerys Flores.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a confident tone and a fearless smile, the witch introduced herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not trying to badmouth you, just trying to tell you a fact. No human would be able to beat me, hero or not, it doesn’t matter. I’ve beaten thousands of people like you and I doubt that your fate will end up differently from them. That’s why, get out of my sight. As long as you aren’t foolish enough to take up your sword against me, I’ll show you mercy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a killing intent as she declared that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unknowingly, chill ran down my spine as I swallowed my saliva. She was strong. Really strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when I came face to face with her like this did I understand. This woman was far stronger than anything I’ve faced before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was way stronger than me, who was dubbed as the strongest person in the world by Sage Alicia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, there was something that bothered my mind for a while now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I won’t know that unless I try it. But first, I have a question for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch who had been watching me with crossed arms, tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were the one who created the demons, weren’t you? So, why did you kill the being that you created?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I came to this place was to defeat a powerful demon that had been terrorizing this area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, in front of the cave where the demon lived, I found the witch in the middle of a battle against said demon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t understand what was going on, so I stayed to observe how the battle went. In a short time, she managed to kill the demon by herself, albeit she was a little injured. The demon was supposed to be so strong that no one in the area could manage to defeat it yet, she defeated it in mere minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While there was nothing strange about that, as the witch surely had enough power to do that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would she do that in the first place? It didn’t make any sense to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my question, the witch furrowed her brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My, they’re my creations. I can do anything I want with them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something strange was going on. She was different from the rumors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, whatever, I could find out about it after I took her into custody.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I guess that’s true. Alright, prepare yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drew my sword. A silver light appeared on the surface of the sword when I infused my exorcism into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a reckless man. Even though I went as far as to warn you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch sighed and summoned her staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a coincidence that I met her here, but it was an amazing coincidence as it was the perfect opportunity to defeat her. After all, her wounds from the last battle hadn’t healed completely yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a hero who carried the hope of the people, the sooner I got to defeat the witch the better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here I come, witch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come forward, hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle on that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ended in my complete defeat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Another dream, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered as I woke up from my sleep before clicking my tongue in annoyance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how many times I’ve dreamt about the time when I got beaten up by the witch, it always made me feel sick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hands of the clock on my desk pointed to 6.40. It was too early to get up but too late to go back to sleep, so I dragged my body off my bed. I picked up my phone on the desk and unplugged the charger. Then, I noticed that there was an unread RINE message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was from Shindou Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went down to the living room while reading the message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wanna do a study group with everyone?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mind, but why did she ask about it now? She shoulda asked about it at school later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, right, today is Saturday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Realizing that, I went back to sleep. (T/N: Me.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, I was in front of the family restaurant where I was working at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the restaurant, bowed to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who was on shift and noticed Yuuka waving at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, you’re late, you know?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a soft smile on her pretty face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was currently 1.30pm, thirty minutes late from the promised time, which was 1pm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. I overslept.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji, who was sitting next to Yuuka, shrugged his shoulders exaggeratedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, get a hold of yourself, the exam starts this monday, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh? Really? It’s that close?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least remember the date of your own exam, idiot..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina muttered exasperatedly at my reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I remember it, it just slipped my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, are you ready for it? I’m not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saying something like that so proudly, what the hell is wrong with you? …Also, what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji was playing a game on his phone while munching some fries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the rest of the group were studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dumbass, I’m taking a break here. Studying all the time is tiring.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You had rested long enough already, Shinji! Your resting time is longer than your studying time, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s because I don’t need that much time to study. I just need to study the important bits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who was the one who summarized those important bits for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t thank you enough, Yuuka-sama… Please accept my gratitude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Shinji suddenly bowed down to Yuuka. There was an empty seat next to Hina, so I sat there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of us here gathered to study together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, this is unusual. Why are we holding a study group, anyway?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that Yuuka was smart enough that she didn’t need to study with other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, doing it once in a while isn’t bad. Besides, it isn’t like I understand everything that I have to study.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that’s why this Hina is here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Godou and I won’t be much help, that’s for sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why Shinji always had that arrogant tone… Well, whatever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are other reasons too…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secret~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka while smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I’m tired of studying. Can I go home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji blurted out. He looked completely unmotivated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, Shinji!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka lightly hit him in the head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cut that out. You won’t get good grades if you keep this up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s a miracle that I got into this school in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why you gotta study harder. You barely even studied and yet you got into this school anyway, that meant you aren’t bad. I’ve summarized everything, so you just need to study this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Math still looks like moon runes to me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji tried desperately not to face Yuuka’s gaze as she was gently telling him off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Never change, you two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those two were always on good terms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that both of them were friends since middle school, but they were so close to each other to the point that I felt suspicious about their relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji tried to flirt with a lot of girls, but the only girl he actually tried to befriend was Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you trying to say? Your grade is as bad as mine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji grunted as he said that. It seemed like he misunderstood my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never got a red mark, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Really? That’s news to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka said in surprise. Hina joined in and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how he did it, but he always managed to barely pass the red marks somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s amazing in a sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t praise me too much, you two. I’m embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know it isn&#8217;t praise!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina retorted sharply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true though, I’ve never got a single red mark in my life. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, Shinji, how was your midterm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Shinji laughed confidently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh… I’ll exercise my rights to stay silent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He barely passed everything except for math. He got a red mark for math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I hate listening to Murakami’s class…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop making excuses, just do it, it’s not that hard!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this rate, you’re going to be dragged by Murakami-sensei to his supplementary class, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yuuka said that, Shinji made a horrified look on his face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t want that, then study properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, it feels like she’s his owner or something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled at the sight wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, Yuuka puffed her cheeks in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to be this guy’s owner!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His mom then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s even worse! I don’t want a womanizer as a son!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her response was unusually fierce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She acted like this, but whenever she was with Hina by themselves, all she talked about was Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? My bad then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should leave those two alone. I approached Hina and started studying together with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After ordering a drink and a light snack, I asked Hina,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, how are you faring?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, I guess. I should be able to get 80 in everything at least…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Same as usual then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands didn’t stop moving as she answered that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was solving the math problems at an absurd speed. No wonder her grades were so high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl always occupied the second or third place of our grade. That was only because the first place was reserved to Yuuka, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Math is too hard for me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? It’s harder than back in the first year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were chatting like that, the waiter, one of my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, brought me my order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We exchanged a few words of greeting before he continued with his work. Then suddenly, Hina muttered something,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, this is where you’re working at, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you really just come to this place without realizing it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, Yuuka joined in,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“While we’re at it, since you’re our friends and all, can we get a discount–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka pouted after hearing my answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This restaurant’s location was right in front of the station. It was close to school and the price was reasonable, so it wouldn’t be strange for students like us to gather here. The place was spacious too, so other people wouldn’t be bothered even if we were to make some noise here. In fact, there were two other groups studying here too. Some people in those groups were my acquaintances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, she’s here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina, who had been looking at her phone, suddenly shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her gaze toward the entrance and waved her hand energetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I had a bad feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I knew that it would come to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, why else would Yuuka invite us to study together?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, Mai-chan!~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch appeared in front of us, carrying a backpack with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a white blouse and a black skirt. It was simple, but it suited her well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was frustrating for me to say this, but she looked really cute. I wouldn’t say it to her face though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heya, Mai-chan. Let’s study hard together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, Shiina-san. That outfit suits you well. You look cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? T-Thank you very much…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say anything unnecessary, Shinji. Ah, would you like to sit next to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! U-Um, Yuuka-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, Just Yuuka is fine. Well, if you’re comfortable calling me that, it’s fine!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way they referred to each other seemed to have changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suspected that they became closer, but despite that, the witch was still the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked very nervous in the beginning, but when she noticed me, she furrowed her brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You want to say something to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Didn’t you hear about me being here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch took her seat. Yuuka smiled at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you’re a new student, there might be a lot of things you don’t understand or the exam’s scope is different from your previous school, that’s why I invited you here, Shiina-san! You can ask Hina if you have any questions!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind, but isn’t this the part where you tell her to rely on you instead?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you’re a better teacher than me, Hina!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But your grade is higher than mine…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch flustered, probably because she was left off the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Hina tried to bring her into the conversation again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, anyway, Mai-chan, let’s review the exam’s scope first. I made a summary of it, you can check mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Thank you very much!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch bowed her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, she took her seat and the study group finally started in earnest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, everyone was chatting about random things but, as time went by, those conversations died down as everyone became more focused on their studies. Though, it wasn’t like we didn’t talk at all. It was just, all of our ‘conversations’ were just us teaching each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka was taking care of Shinji, meanwhile Hina and I helped the witch out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew, I’m going to get myself a drink…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina let out a deep breath as she lightly shook her empty glass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, let me get it for you, I want to get some too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch as she raised her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then, can you get me melon soda?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay! Um, what about the others?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji and Yuuka were too occupied with their things, so they didn’t answer her question. Or probably they just didn’t hear her because her voice was too low. The witch’s gaze turned toward me for a moment, but she immediately turned it away again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she realized that she didn’t need to do that much for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped studying and looked at her. She went to the refill area with two glasses in her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…And when she got there, she stared at the machine listlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t know how to use it, of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was an anime, there would be a question mark floating around her head at this moment. Well, to be fair, she wasn’t a commoner like us, so she’d probably never used the machine in her entire life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed and headed toward her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored the glare of the embarrassed witch and got myself a drink. Since I drank melon soda just now, I decided to get oolong tea instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch stared at me and snorted after realizing what I was doing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Then, she suddenly furrowed her brows, as if she was in pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, witch, what’s wrong? Did you catch a cold?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could tell that her center of gravity felt off. Even though her expression was the same as usual, her body seemed unsteady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not, I wouldn’t be here if that’s the case. I don’t want to trouble the others…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. Well, if there’s nothing wrong with you, it’s all good then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch boldly operated the machine and tried to get melon soda. When the drink came out of the machine, her body trembled for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m not surprised or anything!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t ask if you were surprised or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to leave her alone and got back to my seat first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch did the same after she got her own drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I observed the witch when she was walking toward us. She walked slowly and carefully, as if she was afraid to drop the drinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While that wasn’t a problem, she seemed to be putting all her concentration on keeping her body steady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came back, Hina thanked her for the melon soda. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch just exhaled lightly in response. After that, she began to study with Hina again. From time to time, she would frown and rub her forehead with her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how I see it, she didn’t seem to be okay at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped writing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina, do you have a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up as I asked her that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked that, but in truth, I didn’t know what I wanted to talk about with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were simply too many things to talk about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou? What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina and the others looked at me strangely as I was the only one who was standing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch seemed to understand my intention when our gazes met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around and left, she followed behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um, we have something to talk about, s-so we’re going outside for a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch smiled as she explained the situation to the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, I didn’t prepare an excuse to tell the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just realized that I had been distracted for a while now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Ah, I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been feeling irritated toward the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My thoughts drifted to the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, the Witch of Calamity spared my life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a fierce battle, I was utterly defeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell to the ground. There were wounds all over my body and I couldn’t muster any strength to take a step forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that point, I’ve already given up. I accepted that I didn’t have what it takes to be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It isn’t even worth it to kill you. Take this as a lesson and stop playing hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch gave me a half-assed reason and left the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Not worth killing’, she said. Didn’t she realize that there were wounds all over her body too? Even her clothes had turned into a rag and there was blood seeping through the tears in her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, while I was in a similar state, there were no fatal wounds on my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a fierce battle like that, she had the lenience to not land any mortal wounds to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That meant she was strong enough to kill me and she decided not to for some reason, despite the fact I was doing my best to kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I found you again, witch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I tell you to give up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again and again, we fought each other to death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first five or six times ended in my defeat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, the witch refused to kill me and she always managed to find a reason to let me go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to follow her trail, I found out that she never tried to kill anyone who attacked her. Aside from that, it seemed like her goal was to kill all the demons she came across.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I noticed this strange situation, I decided to ask the person in question about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn’t you kill the people who attacked you? Why did you kill the demons? Aren&#8217;t you their creator? Aren’t you supposed to be the source of all this disaster in the world?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the witch never answered my questions properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always covered the truths with lies. Lies that made it as if she was a genuinely wicked person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can do whatever I want. I’m the witch, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, our fights continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over time, I started to fare better against her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we started to have more evenly matched battles, the witch started to run away whenever things got dire for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time that I’ve faced someone as strong as her and thanks to that, I grew stronger at a quick pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only my physical capabilities and swordsmanship, my exorcism also grew stronger. Everytime I faced her vicious spells, I had to wield my exorcism to counter it and as a result, I became more proficient in wielding it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so our fights continued. Again. Again. And again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chased after the witch and she kept accepting my challenges whenever we met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could always run away if she wanted to, but she only did it when I was on the brink of defeat. I didn’t understand the reason why she did it for a long time, but I managed to find out when everything was about to come to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After countless fights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thrusted the tip of my sword to the witch’s throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her mana had been depleted. She couldn’t run away anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, you can finally dispel my curse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch. Her tone was so calm and she looked like she was satisfied by this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there was no reason for us to fight anymore, she told me to end her life and closed her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she didn’t need to tell me that. I was the hero, it was my duty to put an end to her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, before I did, I asked her the reason behind her actions for one last time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May I ask you why you did all this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right, it would be lonely if I’d just die like that, hm? Alright, let me tell you a story about a poor witch. Don’t forget it later, okay? Think of it as a last gift from me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to spare the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside the restaurant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a small space surrounded by trees at the back of the building. It was the staff’s smoking area. The staff normally would go there if they wanted to take a break. There were benches there, so we could sit down if we wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on the bench, meanwhile the witch leaned her back on the wall nearby and crossed her arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, what is it? Can’t you just call me out in a more natural way?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asked the witch as she let out a snort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Always the pleasant girl whenever she was talking with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she acted meekly in front of Hina and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, I didn’t feel like doing that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I apologized in a monotonous voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard my voice, she furrowed her brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? What’s with that tone? Are you mad because I scolded you yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words pissed me off, but that wasn’t the reason why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was another reason why I acted like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I’ve been thinking since yesterday…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re one hell of a hypocrite, you know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My complicated feelings toward her could be expressed with those words.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You tried to save everyone but yourself. You called yourself a hero, you tried to bring happiness to others, but you can’t even bring it to yourself… That’s the thing I hate the most about you… That’s the reason why I hate you.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what she said to me yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, she also did that herself. She had no right to tell me off about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve always hated that side of hers. She kept treating her life lightly and kept refusing my help whenever I offered it to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you on about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch tilted her head with a puzzled expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how I think about it, there’s clearly something strange with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she was a clumsy girl and her socializing skill was zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, she wasn’t this bad originally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forgetting to change shoes at the school entrance, forgetting that the tea she was about to drink could burn her tongue, falling off her bike and so on. The witch that I knew would never do that no matter how clumsy she was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought it was because she let her guard down too much in this peaceful world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, after confirming the fact that her curse had eroded </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> far, I realized that,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re trying to hide that your body is breaking down, aren’t you?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That conclusion made more sense than my first guess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t notice those little things because she had been enduring the pain all this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet she acted haughtily in front of me, scolding me about the things that she had clearly been doing all this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just like back in our previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With each battle, I grew stronger. At first, I thought that I grew up at a really quick pace, but it wasn’t actually the case. Yes, I grew stronger, but at the same time, the witch grew weaker after each battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The curse took a toll on her body and the more time passed, the more it made her physically and mentally unwell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably in a similar state as back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about that, she asked me a question,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you on about? Of course my body is breaking down. Is it not obvious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch said it dismissively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? She admitted it that easily?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you?—”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, my body is different than my previous life’s body. Back then, I was born a genius. I was a natural at both witchcraft and magic and thanks to that, my resistance to curses was much higher than now. That’s why when I casted that curse into my body, I didn’t die immediately… But this body is different…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always had a pale complexion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she always looked like that, I always thought that she originally had a paler skin compared to other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seemed like my guess was off, yet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m under a curse, of course I’m always in pain. My body back then was too strong, that was why I was able to endure it. Curses are meant to make the person afflicted with it suffer, that’s the whole point of it. Honestly, it’s hard for me to stand up properly right now…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone was filled with self-mockery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could weaken the pain with my magic, but I can’t solve the fundamental issue without your exorcism. I need you to do something about it before I can’t endure the pain anymore and my lifespan is cut by half. That’s your duty, your atonement for sparing me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she no longer had the reason to act tough in front of me, she sat down on where she stood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved to support her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn’t you say that earlier?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it’s none of your business! You only need to do your duty! My pain has nothing to do with you! It’s my punishment for everything that I have done…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you told me earlier, I would’ve tried harder to weaken the curse!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then you’ll overextend yourself again. I’ve told you before, you aren’t a hero anymore, you have no reason to help me! I’m your enemy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t bring myself to say anything to her after hearing her cries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn’t you kill me back then?!&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cried out again. There were tears in her eyes this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you killed me back then, none of this would have happened!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My action back then caused her this much pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I had made an irreversible mistake. She was right, I had to atone for this sin of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Cerys’ PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My past wasn’t that big of a deal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t a special case, there were countless people in that world who had gone through something similar to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I barely remembered anything about that time to begin with. I only started to remember bits and pieces of it recently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lived in a small remote town. Since my parents were ordinary shoemakers, I had a pretty normal upbringing. My family was quite normal. If I had to describe it, at least they didn’t hit me or anything like that. Though, I couldn’t say that they loved me that much either. Everyday they only gave me tasteless bread and soup for me to eat and I had to work every day. I had nothing to complain about living that kind of life, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sure that my parents felt the same way too. They wouldn’t get angry at me as long as I did my job and if I did my job well, they’d give me praise. I was happy enough with that life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I barely even remembered what they looked like nowadays. However, back then, they were more important than anything else to me. Mostly because I didn’t speak to anyone other than them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But one day, they died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They wandered into the slum by accident and ended up getting robbed and killed. It couldn’t be helped, as it was a common occurrence in that world. If you scoured through the entire continent, you’d find such things happening in every city. In any case, they didn’t come back home that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only found out about their deaths when the landlord threw me out of the house my parents were renting. They showed me my parents corpse as a justification for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw their lifeless bodies, I cried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But their deaths weren&#8217;t the cause of my sadness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, it was because I became aware of the feelings that I had been hiding.</span></p>

<p><b>I hated them.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I hated everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated my parents who never treated me kindly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated everyone in the town who looked at me with disgusted eyes just because we were poor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated the town that treated deaths as if it was a common occurrence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated the cruel world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Foolishly, I kept on hating everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hatred enveloped my soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that hatred, I cursed the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sang the song of hatred.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let this world be cursed for eternity.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let this world be damned for eternity.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became a foolish girl who knew nothing about the world, hated, resented and cursed the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I only wanted to feel someone’s warmth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I only wanted to live in a friendlier world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dreamt of such a future, but since the world didn’t let me realize that dream, I cursed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing that I did was a common thing that everyone who lived in misery in that world did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except that I was born with a talent for witchcraft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was more talented than anyone else in that world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the song of hatred that I sang became a powerful curse that afflicted the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the world was plunged into a disaster as countless vicious man-eating demons appeared all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The song of a small child made millions of people suffer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I came to realize this fact, I had turned into the Witch of Calamity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shoulda known from the beginning, but my foolish self had only just realized it when it was already too late… The fact that I was someone that should have never been born.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Grey’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered the story that the witch told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story of the pitiful, lonely witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After creating the demons, she went around the world to kill them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She prioritized the stronger demons who were more likely to harm other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witchcraft was an art of casting curses, but it was unable to dispel the already casted curses. Only exorcists could dispel curses, but the witch was unable to use it. In other words, she couldn’t do anything about the curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, she killed the demons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people of the world called her the Witch of Calamity and resented her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They always tried to hunt her and kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to die, but if she ever died, a greater disaster would befall the world, so she decided that she shouldn’t offer herself to the people. And so, she kept running while killing the demons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, I appeared before her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an exorcist, I was her greatest enemy, but at the same time, I could become her savior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I could dispel the curse that rooted deep inside the world’s core.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why the witch welcomed the fights with me, to make my exorcism grow stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, when I finally rested my sword upon her throat, the witch felt relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had no more regrets as I had become strong enough to dispel the curse out of the world completely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had become capable of killing her and dispelling the curse embedded deeply within her soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, she would finally be released from the painful life she had been living.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To her, I was her hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me that there was no need for me to hesitate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was happiness in her face as she tried to convince me of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was delighted, from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I’ve seen her beautiful smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, I,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What’s wrong? Kill me quickly, my hero, Grey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Couldn’t bring myself to swing my sword down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand was stiff, unmoving. The reason for that was obvious.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Vanquish evil, save others.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Fight for justice.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As a hero, your duty is to kill the witch.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Remember the purpose of why you’re wielding that power.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The action was against the role I was supposed to play.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because in my eyes, Cerys Flores wasn’t a bad person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since she was a good person, I had to save her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what my conviction told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the same time, it was my duty to kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And killing her would also be her salvation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch wanted me to bring her salvation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn’t want that. I didn’t want to kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I racked my brain, and came to a conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was God&#8217;s chosen. The witch was my enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I had no reason to fulfill her wish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I sheathed my sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time in my life that I refused someone’s call for help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, the witch was stunned after seeing my action.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she started to desperately beg me to kill her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I refused to kill her. I decided that I would never help her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a lot of excuses in my head, but the reason why I did it was because I couldn’t forgive her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t forgive the world that made her like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t forgive this woman who thought that this kind of conclusion was okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Don’t f**k with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I felt anger. It was the first time the machine called hero felt anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I vowed to show her what true happiness looked like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You aren’t evil. I’m a hero, a hero wouldn’t kill a good person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeated the words I’ve been saying to the witch back in our previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Killing her meant I’d be going against the principle of heroism itself and I would be acting against the role that had been assigned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, the witch’s face contorted as she gritted her teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cursed the world, you know?! I made the world suffer! I’ve caused countless deaths! How could you say that I’m not evil?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn’t even do that voluntarily! You were just mourning the death of your parents, you didn’t mean to make anyone suffer! If you’re evil, then why were you trying to help other people?! They hated you, you could just leave them to die!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could just run away and admit that it wasn’t her fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could just ignore those people who weren’t worthy of her help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never seen a kinder person than her in my entire life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I was doing didn’t matter! In the end, I cursed the world and that was what everyone in that world cared about! I helped them so I could atone for my sins! I know that won’t make them forgive me, but still, I had to do that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An evil person wouldn’t even think of something like that, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed the witch’s collar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pulling her close, I stared deeply into her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The world might think you’re evil, but I don’t care what they think. You’re a good person. I’ve seen your kindness with my own eyes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a weak laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a faint smile on her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That kind of thinking is why the church executed you back then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The church executed me because I was going against God&#8217;s decree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I decided to spare the witch back then, we went on a journey together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A journey to save the world.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘We’re only doing this because we have the same goal. That’s the extent of our relationship, got it?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You don’t need to tell me that.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to save the world, we first had to go to the center of the world and get rid of the curse from there.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Isn’t swinging your sword the only thing you can do? Just go forward, I’ll protect your back.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;You don’t need to tell me that. I don’t expect a weak-ass like you to be the vanguard anyway.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Who did you call a weak-ass?! Seriously, shut your mouth and fight already!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To get to the center of the world, we had to travel through the Great Dungeon at the center of the continent. However, due to the witch’s curse, the dungeon had transformed to a den of demons.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> ‘W-Wait, are you okay?!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;What? Are you worried about me?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘O-Of course not! If you were to die after letting me live like this, I swear I’ll never forgive you!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;What an annoying woman. Well, whatever.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we weren’t unscathed, in the end we managed to get rid of the curse deep inside the Great Dungeon.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘We did it! We did it, Grey!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Yeah. Guess my role as a hero ends here.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What? What’s with that lackluster response? Aren’t you happy about this?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I feel relieved more than happy, honestly.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we saved the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve done my part as the chosen hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on our way back, the elite group of the church ambushed us.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ex-Hero, Grey Handlet. You are under arrest.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I managed to make the witch escape safely, I used up my power and ended up captured by the church. According to them, my crime was being brainwashed by the witch. I tried to explain to them what really happened, but no one lent their ears to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The church announced to the world that the hero had betrayed them, the people, the world and God. The witch and I were the one who successfully saved the world, but the church claimed it as their achievements instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I was executed as a sinner. The hero had fallen into a sinner who was hated by the whole world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was the end of my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the end of Grey Handlet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was one thing that I regretted back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I promised the witch that I’d show her what true happiness looked like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, I left her behind in that world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was all alone in that world.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You’re no longer a hero.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that better than anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Even before I was reincarnated to this world, I was no longer a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t able to become her hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remained as her nemesis until the very end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that, but I was too afraid to admit it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, for the longest time, I decided not to think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cerys…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But one question remained unsolved for me. What happened to her after I died?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she reincarnated to this world, then, how did she die?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened to you after that?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, she grabbed my collar. There was hatred in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could you ask me that kind of question casually?! You died, so I could no longer be saved back then! Because of you, I missed my chance to die! And…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a pained sigh as tears began to fall from her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;After you were gone, I became alone again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t say anything after hearing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could do nothing but watch as her tears fell into the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Around the time you were executed, they managed to catch up to me. The people who were deemed as failures of the Hero Creation Project by the Sage… The exorcists…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch wiped her tears with her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Sage was correct, they were failures. Even when grouped together, they were unable to dispel the curse bound to my soul. In the end, only you were able to do that. So, I decided to reincarnate both you, who were about to be executed and myself to this world…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You were killed around the time I was executed, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her end was too sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I deserved that, so I don’t really care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I talked too much. We should go back, everyone will be worried.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, we aren’t done yet! What can I do to help—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no reason to answer that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cut me off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously, worry about yourself first before worrying about others. Stop that curse-driven action of yours. I’ll say it again, you’re no longer a hero and I’m your nemesis, so stop trying to help me… Just leave me alone…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you confidently say that your actions aren’t being influenced by the curse from your previous life?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t answer her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can’t answer, then you know what to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even attempt to move my lips to answer her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You once said that you’d show me what true happiness looked like. I know you meant well and you probably are still thinking of doing it, but, don’t screw with me, you don’t even know what it looks like yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean I don’t know? I’ve seen true happiness before.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, have you experienced it yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what did it matter?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve never experienced it because I’ve never thought about my own happiness to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Enough, let’s just go back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch sighed and turned away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensing that my legs didn’t move, she turned her glance toward me once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’ll get suspicious if we don’t move soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can I ask you something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch and I were enemies, so there was no reason for me to help her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if that was the case, why did she keep admonishing me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was she concerned about me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cerys, why did you choose to reincarnate to this world?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called her name and asked her in a serious tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand why you reincarnated us into another world, but, why here? Why did you reincarnate us into this peaceful country? Answer me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that it was because of her kindness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She did everything for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, tears welled up in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Just wanted to make you happy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, she dashed into the restaurant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was unfair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glued to where I stood for a while before I followed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky above was cloudy, perfectly resembling my gloomy state of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the study session continued and ended in an awkward atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, of course it would be the case. The witch came back with both her eyes swollen because of tears. She didn’t tell anyone why she was crying and I also had no reason to tell them, so everyone could only express their concerns in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, I regretted asking that to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really shouldn’t have brought up that topic back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While apologizing inwardly to the witch, I pedaled my bike with Hina by my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weather was cold for summer. It seemed like it was about to rain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What happened to Mai-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina asked me. I couldn’t discern her current emotion from her tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if I say nothing actually happened?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long do you think I’ve known you? It was obvious from Mai-chan’s face that something did happen back then. Don’t even try to lie to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina said, matter-of-factly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to tell her, but the content of my conversation with the witch wasn’t something I could tell others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, what should I tell her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I answered her question with an ambiguous question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina’s eyebrows furrowed in suspicion when she heard that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think it’s normal to help other people in need?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought this kind of thinking was natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless their nature was twisted to begin with, no one would want anyone to be unhappy. Even if it was someone that they hated. They might not want someone they hated to be in their lives, but at the same time, they would be wishing them happiness somewhere they couldn’t see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was someone that they liked, it would be normal for them to help them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted everyone to be happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to see everyone’s smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was I crazy for thinking something like that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it some kind of curse, after all?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My desire to help the witch, did it really come from the bottom of my heart?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina stopped pedaling her bicycle and stared at me in silence for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, your balance is off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Balance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Between tending to yourself and taking care of others, your balance in that regard is off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina got off her bike and started to walk slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did the same and followed behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A normal person would try to look for their own happiness first before starting to take care of others but that’s only if they could afford to do it in the first place. Of course, it depends on the context. Like, if I saw someone got lost in the middle of nowhere, I’d try to call out to them, at least. In your case, you always tried to help others without minding your own well being. It isn’t like you could afford to do it either, you’re just ignoring your own happiness. That’s why you always ended up hurting yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I mean, people’s happiness is my happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glared at me with anger welled up in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What would you feel if I were to give up my life to save you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, don’t you even dare to think about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her with difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, she snorted and turned her face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a selfish answer. If you want me to accept your thinking, then you have no right to complain if I were to do the same thing as you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that was not how it was. Hina and I were different. I was different from the rest of the people of this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, was it really the case?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, even if I hated to admit it, I was no longer a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head started to hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve always been like this, but ever since a year ago, you became even more strange, you know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice, as she admonished me, was sharp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You stopped smiling as much, you kept pushing yourself to help others and you kept insisting that you were happy living like that. Hey, do you think people would be happy if you keep on meddling in their lives?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, what are you even trying to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closing the distance to the point that our noses almost touched, she looked straight in my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you realize that your life is yours? It’s not mine nor is it other people’s possession.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glared at me and continued talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, your way of doing things is dumb. Yes, there are a lot of people that might need your help, but not everyone would welcome it. This is Japan and we aren’t in a war or something. Even if you leave those people alone, they’ll be able to take care of themselves. Your help isn’t necessary, so stop sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to argue, but no words came out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Honestly, I’m getting more annoyed as I talk. Hey, who do you think you are? Do you think you’re such a great person that you can afford to stick your nose into everyone’s business? Such arrogance. Since when did you become such a great person, huh? What, are you thinking that you’re some kind of hero or something? Get back to reality, you’re nothing.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No one expected anything from you.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, arrogant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">-kun, let me tell you something. Whether you exist or not, the world goes on. Your existence won’t change anything. Do you get it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like she had vented out all her pent up feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were insulting. She rejected my way of life, the things I stood for, everything. Her tone sounded like she was condemning me as a person. She was treating me like a child who mistakenly thought that he was born special.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But strangely enough, her words didn&#8217;t hurt me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I already understood everything that she said. But after she pointed it out again, it made me realize that I understood nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can I even… Live a normal life?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her, Hina let out a frustrated grunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you talking about? Just live your life the way you want to live. Just keep in mind that no one expects anything from you. Your existence is replaceable, the world will go on even if you don’t exist.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina closed the distance between us again and gently flicked my forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know that, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at my palm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could vividly remember the sensation of the blood-soaked sword I had always carried. But that sword was no longer there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is it real? No one is expecting anything from me? My existence doesn’t actually matter? …I guess so, huh? Of course, that’s the way it is, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly, you dumbass! Stupid-ass </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">! Do you think you’re a hero or something? You’re a high school student already, gosh, get yourself together! I swear, I always get second-hand embarrassment whenever I see you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s just mean!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina’s insults made me flustered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see… I was that kind of guy huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my feelings, Hina looked at me concernedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry, I went overboard… I-I couldn’t help it, okay? Seeing you like that made me frustrated…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, I bursted out laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s fine. Thank you, Hina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her in the eyes and thanked her. Her words were true, there was no reason for her to apologize.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your words saved me, Hina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You… Are you a masochist?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No?! What the hell?! How the hell did you come to that conclusion?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that her words saved me, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably it was because it came from her, the girl who had been watching over me since I was a kid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad that you’re my childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, she averted her gaze as her face reddened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah, you should be more grateful to me… Y-You’re a handful, don’t you know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not a hero anymore, just a normal high school student that could be found anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that fact since long ago, but I finally understood what it meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always thought that helping people was something that I had to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether I was a hero or not, people always expected me to help them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It always felt like people were expecting something from me, just like back in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina’s words reminded me that there were no such things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m just a normal high school student, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No? There’s no way in hell you’re normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?! What do you mean?! Didn’t you just say–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you realize that you’re a weirdo?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wha?! Me? A weirdo?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I was just trying to imitate my previous self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my horrified look, Hina bursted out laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I guess I have to thank you once again. For always staying by my side, even though I’m like this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina flinched. It seemed like my words caught her off guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-This guy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face started to redden again. Was she okay? She didn’t catch a cold or anything, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes, I’m fine. I don’t know why, but I feel tired. I wanna stop by there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then pushed her bike to a parking lot in front of a convenience store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed suit and we entered the convenience store together. We decided to buy some ice cream and ate it under the shade next to the building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because we had been talking under the sun for a while, we were drenched in sweat and we just realized it when we were resting like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to look for a new purpose in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to try finding something that I really enjoy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back when I was talking with the witch, the sky was cloudy, but all the clouds had already gone away before I knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know it’ll be hard to change myself at this point, but still…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that it was a given that I should live like I did back in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, Hina and the witch told me that it wasn’t the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From now on, I’m going to live for myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to make fun memories, to do whatever I wanted to do, to enjoy myself to the fullest and to look for my own happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was something that I always dreamed about as a kid, but when I started to regain the memory of my previous life, I started to forget about that dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina as she showed me a bright smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re happy, everyone will also be happy for you, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile was as bright as the sun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re right… I wonder why I didn&#8217;t notice such a simple thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you’re an idiot, that’s why.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked really happy right now. And I felt happy when I saw her like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Hina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can see your bra.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her thin shirt was drenched in sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since that was the case, it stuck closely to her skin and I could see her pink bra through her wet shirt. Gotta say, this was a pleasant sight to see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My eyes?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl just thrusted her fingers into my eyes without hesitation, wow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in my previous life, this kind of bold girl was rare. Maybe she had the knack to become a warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really can’t let my guard down around you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved away from me while shielding her chest with her arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Anyway, let’s get back to the previous topic. What were you talking about with Mai-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Similar to what we were talking about just now. She scolded me really hard…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? That girl can actually scold other people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina, who didn’t know the witch’s true nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, that girl is similar to you. Always trying to push herself too hard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she continued trying to analyze the witch’s personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, she’s different from you. How can I put it… It feels like she’s afraid of people. To be exact, she’s afraid of being hated by people. It’s funny to think about it. She’s so cute, there’s no way that she only got one or two confessions in her entire life yet, she’s this insecure about herself. She’s always acting as if she’s an outcast or something too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a good analysis, as expected of her. I knew that she was a sharp girl. Among all of us, she was the one who kept an eye on other people around her the most.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whenever we talked to her, even though she’s scared and easily frightened, I could tell that she’s genuinely happy. We were just talking normally, but she acted as if she couldn’t be happier than that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no doubt that the witch felt genuinely happy when Hina and the others talked to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I like her. No matter how lame or suspicious she acts, I will always like that girl. I’m sure Yuuka thinks so too. That’s why, I want to ask you. You knew her for a long time, right? How did she become like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flinched when I heard her question. Should I tell Hina about the witch’s past or not?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After contemplating for a bit, I decided to tell her about it. Of course, I’ll let the other world stuff out of the story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her briefly about the witch’s past. How she accidentally hurt other people without meaning to and because of that, they grew to hate her. That was the reason why she became afraid of other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. That’s why you’re trying to take care of her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still, there’s no reason for you to keep all this to yourself. I’m Mai-chan’s friend too. Not only me, Yuuka and… Even though I hate to admit it, Shinji too… We are her friends too. You aren’t alone, we want the same thing too. We want her to be able to have a normal life too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina’s words made me feel strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Sure, I was no longer a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that didn’t mean the nature of my relationship with the witch changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever we turned into, we would always be enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That meant, we hated each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What reason would I have to help the witch right now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only after a while that I came up with that question.</span></p>
