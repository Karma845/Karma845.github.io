<h3>Epilogue &#8211; Shiraishi Godou and Shiina Mai</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last day of the exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I didn’t know whether I did well in the subjects for the day or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that I wouldn’t get any red marks, but at the same time, it was doubtful that I’d get the average mark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was holding my head in my hands, Shiina called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it wasn’t for yesterday, I would’ve been able to do more…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pulling an all-nighters wouldn’t help you by much anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess… What about you? Everything’s fine? It’s your first exam, so the scope of the exam should be different from your previous school. Did you have it hard?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you mocking me? All I’ve been doing at home is reading and studying, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say that so smugly like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to react to her self-deprecating jokes. Actually, knowing her, she probably didn’t mean it as a joke. That was just how her daily life had been, so she just said it like it was nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, if you ever have to retake the exam, I’ll help you to study for it. It was partly my responsibility that you had a hard time today and besides… W-we’re f-friends…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away after she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I got embarrassed too, thanks to her. Seriously, if saying something corny made her embarrassed, she shouldn’t be saying it in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I guess so… W-We’re friends, aren’t we?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah… E-Even if we didn’t want it to happen, w-we became friends anyway…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both fell to silence. What was with this awkward atmosphere? Could I leave now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said too many cringy lines yesterday, I didn’t want to remember any of it. I hope I can erase my memory of it. This morning I rolled around my room the moment I woke up. Seriously, what the hell did I do yesterday?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What exclusive hero? What are you, an idiot? How could you say something cheesy like that?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, how could that girl listen to those words earnestly like that? Was she an idiot?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Well, don’t worry about me, I-I doubt I’ll have to retake it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is that so? G-Glad to hear that. Y-You aren’t that stupid, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop calling me an idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I yelled at her to deny her words, Shiina pouted her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is this not how you normally talk to your friend? U-Um…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked, looking unsure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you’re right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say it is because you are close that you can freely throw insults at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina tilted her head, confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she didn’t really know how friendships worked in the first place, so I guess it was a given that she’d be puzzled about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because all the people she met in her previous life were hostile to her, she became used to throwing out cold words. That was why she developed that honor student persona of hers, so she wouldn’t unilaterally spit out poison at random people. She acted suspiciously at times because she didn’t know what to say aside from those harsh words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t understand. Friends… How am I supposed to act around them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Personally, I don’t care if she acts normal around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Friends are just people you are comfortable with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this clumsy girl wouldn’t listen to me if I were to tell her that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, now that the exam is over, it’s time to have fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Have fun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I’ll teach you how to have fun with your friends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What exactly should I do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything, really. Shopping, karaoke, bowling… Hell, just going out together counts. Anything fun so we can forget about the exam works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;We don’t have to do those things together, do we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The point of it was that we would be doing it together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The more the merrier. If it’s someone you don’t know, then it’s acceptable if you feel awkward, but with friends, you shouldn’t be. Friends are the people you’re comfortable with, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Wait, I just said those embarrassing lines with a straight face…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just earlier, I swore at myself for doing it yesterday and now I did it again. It was too late to regret it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My black history kept accumulating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let’s go… Together…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we were high school students. I should just dismiss my black history as the folly of youth and move on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina let out a wide smile, the smile she had never shown before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll leave myself in your care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we decided to do karaoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um… Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah? …Well, you don’t need to talk, I know what you are going to say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina was frozen stiff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reason being…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woohoo! It’s been a while since I last came here!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You always come here every time an exam is over…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s a good distraction. Now, let’s sing to our hearts content!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina, Shinji and Yuuka were all here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After our conversation, Shiina and I decided to do karaoke, but along the way we ran into Shinji and Yuuka. After that, Yuuka invited Hina to join us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you feel uncomfortable?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, I don’t, it’s just…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I knew that she’d act like this, that was why I was hesitant when those three decided to join in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You know, those three were worried about you too. They noticed that you hadn’t been feeling well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, she froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. That’s why you should show them that you’re doing well. You might think of them as strangers, but they thought of you as their friends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh? I-Is it that easy to make friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the only one in this room who’d think that it’s hard…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flicked her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shinji saw me talking with Shiina, he poked me in the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys are getting along well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More like we’re getting along </span><b>better</b><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him that, he smirked before letting out a hearty laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I would be bombarded by a barrage of questions, so I quickly grabbed the microphone. No one would ask me anything if I were to sing now, a perfect countermeasure. I didn’t have much confidence in my singing voice, but I knew that I wasn’t horrible at it at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you do well on the exam, Mai-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… I-I should be fine… I think…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Shiina was dealing with the girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she aware that she was cutting their conversation short with that kind of answer? Well, to be fair, it wasn’t exactly a conversation that should be prolonged to begin with. No one liked talking too much about exams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, it wasn’t like she could fix her shyness overnight. She had to steadily cure her fear of people and lack of self-esteem by constantly talking with other people like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about that, I finished singing my song. Almost immediately, Hina picked up the mic in high spirits. The screen displayed a rather popular idol song.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s sing together, Yuuka!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure! I can only sing the chorus though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the drink bar to get some drinks for myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to our room with a melon soda in hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina was frozen stiff while holding the tablet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, she answered me in a whisper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What should I do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean? You’re at karaoke, just sing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how to…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why the hell did you choose karaoke then?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Out of the many options I offered her, she was the one who picked karaoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it’s better than bowling or any other activities that involve me moving my body around!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. I assume that you don&#8217;t normally listen to popular songs, then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I only listen to classic pieces…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think you can sing those songs here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also… I don’t know how to use this machine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow… You know how to use your phone, right? It’s similar to your phone, you should be able to get the hang of it quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I taught her how to use the tablet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was smart to begin with, so she got the hang of it quicker than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, what are you going to sing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um… Anything that I usually hear on TV, I guess?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said as she pointed to a list of really old songs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, go with that one. It’s old, but everyone should know about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you sure I should go with this? You aren’t making fun of me, are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not. Karaoke is about singing the song you want to sing, no matter how outdated or bad it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, some groups would force you to sing the songs that everyone knew, but it wasn’t the case with our group. Everyone knew that Shiina was bad at socializing and they wouldn’t force her to do anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, you over there! Listen to my singing properly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m listening, so just do your thing, jeez.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes, M-Me too! You’re an amazing singer, Kirishima-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, you think so? Thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina beamed happily. I shrugged my shoulders after seeing her like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina, flattery can hurt people, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say unnecessary things!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh? I-I didn’t mean to…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shina looked flustered and made eye contact with Hina, who was giggling at her. I handed the tablet to Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi Hina, I picked a song, you go sing with her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Okay okay! I didn’t expect you to listen to this kind of song, Shiina-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha… I-I don’t remember the lyrics well though…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, me neither because it’s a really old song.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exchange was clumsy, but Shiina managed to talk more comfortably now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was feeling at ease after seeing her growth, Shinji, who had just come back from getting a drink, sat down beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew what he meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what happened, but it seems like she’s getting better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes were on Shiina, who was holding the mic with both her hands while looking flustered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was obvious that she wasn’t used to being in this kind of situation and I couldn’t help but laugh at her. Her pitch when singing was a little off, but at least she looked like she was having fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, why are you trying to talk to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, I just feel like it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged his shoulders. His gaze looked as if he had seen through me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might be a hero back in my previous life, but the current me was merely a high school student. I wasn’t omnipotent enough to read the thoughts of everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Summer vacation is almost here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka, who sat next to Shinji, said that in a cheerful tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to, we can go out and hang out together. Can you bring Shiina-san with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ask the person yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pointed at Shiina, who was engrossing herself in her singing, Yuuka blinked her eyes and laughed. I mean, I wasn’t Shiina’s guardian or anything, there was no need to go through me for every single thing that involved her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, only Shiina’s and Hina’s singing voices echoed through the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to say that they nailed the song, but Hina was vibing while Shiina did her best to sing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she said that a witch wasn’t allowed to be happy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a full load of cr*p. I wanted her to say that again after looking at her current state in the mirror.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was having fun playing with everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You wanna go somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Let’s go to the beach later!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, that was a bad suggestion. Shiina couldn’t swim, so I could imagine her drowning in the sea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sensed trouble coming in the near future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How was it? I-I didn’t mess up, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Well, if you want my honest opinion, you suck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Really?! I really shouldn’t be allowed to sing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed at Shiina, who acted all depressed after hearing my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, this girl just couldn’t take a joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Talking with her always brought me headaches. Nevertheless, she was my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I was stuck with her since I promised to make her happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, despite what she said, I had to protect that smile of hers from now on. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could sense trouble in the near future. An enjoyable one, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, in a distant land, a witch asked,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we met under different circumstances, would we be able to be friends?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, in a distant land, a hero answered,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing will change between us. Unless we’re reborn in another world.”</span></p>
