<h3>Prologue &#8211; The Hero and The Witch</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A boy and a girl were facing off against each other on a battlefield that had turned into a wasteland.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both looked like they were in their fifteen or sixteen. Despite their youthful outlook, however, they held strong enough power to influence the fate of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. So you’ve got rid of my curse already, hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the silver-haired witch, the bearer of curses and the cause of the various disasters that happened in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I was chosen to get rid of that curse of yours, after all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Answered the blond boy, the strongest hero in existence and the one who bore the fate of saving the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see, so that’s why you look so carefree, hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terrible scars filled their clothes and body, marks of their fierce battle. Their surroundings were in the same shape. The previously lush forest, filled with its majestic greenery was now a barren land devoid of any color save from the color of dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero approached the witch and thrusted his sword on her throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s over. Or do you still think that you can resist?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No. Besides, I have no reason to fight anymore. Let’s just end this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch closed her eyes and said in a whisper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, let me remind you that killing me won’t get rid of all the curses that afflicted this world. If you don&#8217;t strike the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> source of the curses that lie in the root of the world, disasters will still befall the people you’re trying to protect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, I know that. I’ve heard those exact words a million times already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero nodded with an unreadable expression. The witch ignored it and continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With your power, I’m sure you’ll do just fine. You manage to defeat </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, after all. That said, I have no reason to exist in this world anymore…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So, you can kill me now…’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the witch continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hero brandished the pure white sword in his hand. Before he moved his hand, his mouth moved to ask one final question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May I ask you why are you doing all this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right, it would be lonely if I’d just die like that, hm? Alright, let me tell you a story about a poor witch. Don’t forget it later, okay? Think of it as a last gift from me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the witch told him a story. About her thoughts, what she fought for and what she died for. The words that left her mouth were spun beautifully alongside her beautiful voice. The witch, no, the girl, told the boy her life story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll leave everything to you. Make sure to save the world, Hero…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to worry about that. Goodbye, Witch…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the witch’s story was over, once again, the hero brandished his sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the boy who bore the fate of saving the world, finally became the world’s savior.</span></p>
