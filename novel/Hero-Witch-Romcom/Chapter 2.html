<p><b>Chapter 2 &#8211; The Caring Hero and the Clumsy Witch</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we returned to the classroom, all eyes were on us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, this was to be expected. After all, the new student somehow skipped the first class on the very first day she attended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch looked really uncomfortable with all the attention, but she managed to quietly return to her seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, Godou, you sure moved quickly, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji with crossed arms. There was a disgusting grin on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina-san said that she wasn’t feeling well, so I escorted her to the infirmary. There’s nothing more to it. Right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my voice so the witch at the end of the classroom could hear me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes… M-Maybe it’s because I was nervous, b-but I’ve been feeling unwell…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this really that haughty witch? It felt so weird seeing her like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand why she skipped, but why did </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> skip then? If you had to escort her, then just do that and come back quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina approached me as she asked that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was sleepy. Since I was already there, might as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged in response. It was a lie, but there was no way that I’d tell her the truth about what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Still, how did you become so close to her this quickly? There’s something fishy going on here…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina looked at me with suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I told you that you can’t let your guard down, Hina. This guy is a natural at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji as he slapped me on the shoulder. Seriously, stop that, it hurts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina glared at Shinji before turning around and walked toward the witch’s seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright now, Shiina-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! I-I feel better already…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s your first day, so there’s a lot to take in. If you have any troubles, feel free to ask me for help, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina puffed her chest as she said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, her massive weapon became more pronounced and the witch had to witness it in its full glory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a hint of envy on the witch’s gaze as she stared at Hina in silence. Seeing that, I let out a chuckle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the puzzled Hina, the witch shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nothing! U-Um, I-I’ll ask you if I need some help, um…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Girl, your tone is way too stiff. Relax, she is your classmate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, Shiina-san, we’re classmates! Don’t be so stiff, okay? Just talk to me casually!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh?! U-Um… I-I understand!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s still too stiff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh?! U-Um… T-Then… G-Got it… I-Is that how you do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, you’re doing it again. Well, if that’s more comfortable for you, Shiina-san, it’s all right. Have I introduced myself to you? My name is Kirishima Hina. You can call me whatever you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ki-Kirishima-san, is it? M-My name is Shiina Mai, n-nice to meet you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, I know your name already, Shiina-san. You’re an interesting one, don’t you know that?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina laughed loudly at the witch’s response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, that girl was too far gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she was bad at talking with people, but I never knew that she was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw her talking with the crowds earlier today, but I was only observing her from afar, so I didn’t know the details about their conversation. If it went on like this, then it was no wonder that the other girls were laughing around her back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I just realized that I’ve never seen her talk properly with another person back in the other world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I’m starting to feel uneasy for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could she really adapt to this world? I mean, yeah, she had been living here for sixteen years already, but still…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Hina left her side, I quickly went to her side and whispered to her,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get yourself together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Easy for you to say! You know I’m bad at this! Witches aren’t supposed to be friendly with other people to begin with!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you so smug about it? Don’t you realize that you sounded pitiful just now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Pitiful?! I-I’m not! I just love to live in solitude, that’s it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to sugarcoat it, loner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave me alone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was getting teary eyed by my teasing. Suddenly, Shinji cut into our conversation and called out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, don’t leave me behind like that. Heya, Shiina-san~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Shinji approaching her casually like that, the witch’s body stiffened. Oi, why were you like this? Say something quickly!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sent an SOS signal with her gaze to me. Well, it can’t be helped then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shinji, you’re troubling her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean? I was just calling her name!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dumbass, did you look at yourself? You look like a philanderer, you’re scaring her, go away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do I really?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He then took out his phone and took a look at his own reflection there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heya, what are you guys talking about?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another person interrupted our conversation. Shindou Yuuka was her name.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her black hair was tied in a sidetail. There was a gentle smile on her face, it suited her calm demeanor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was well-liked by everyone in class and because of that, she was one of the centers of the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, Yuuka, hear me out–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji talked about how I told him that he frightened the witch. In response, Yuuka nodded happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He is right, so get away from her quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of Yuuka, Hina answered him instead. She brought a group of girls with her and kicked Shinji out of the witch’s vicinity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And once again, people gathered around the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They talked with the witch and occasionally asked her a question or two, in which she only nodded lightly as a response</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I guess I was the only one who could tell how troubled she looked currently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sent me another SOS using her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like the positive vibes that Yuuka and the others brought intimidated her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, really, Yuuka-chan? That’s crazy!~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be especially intimidated by Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina looked like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gyaru</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, but she actually never dated anyone. I knew about that because she was my childhood friend. She received a lot of confessions, but she never accepted any of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she already had someone she liked, who knows. (T/N: Ikr? Who knows.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? What do you think, Shiina-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps noticing that the witch was left out of the conversation, Yuuka tried to drag her into it. As expected, the witch kept stuttering when talking, though she managed to convey what she had in mind. It didn’t show in her face, but it seemed like Yuuka also had some difficulties trying to make her fit in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing wrong with Yuuka. What she did was appropriate in that situation. The problem lies in the witch’s lack of communication skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see tears already forming in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Seriously, wasn’t she supposed to be the Witch of Calamity? Shouldn’t she have more backbone than this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This part of her really hadn’t changed, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, the next class is about to start.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I shooed the girls away, the witch’s face immediately brightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You shouldn’t be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> happy over something like this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I went back to my seat and was greeted by a question from Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, there’s something going on between you two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it was impossible to fool him. He was one of my closest friends after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, this guy was surprisingly observant and he could read the air really well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know her from way back. I’m not that close to her though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Why did you hide it from me then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t lying. It was true that I knew her from the way back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too much of a hassle. Besides, I’m not obligated to tell you everything about my interpersonal relationship.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders as I said that, meanwhile Shinji chuckled in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, I’ll leave it at that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou-kun, can I have a word with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was eating with Shinji, Yuuka approached us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka was Shinji’s classmate back in middle school. Since she had a large circle of friends, they didn’t hang out often, but thanks to that relationship they had, me and her got along quite well. Her coming over to talk to me like this wasn’t a rare occurrence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Yuuka and Shinji stood out because of their appearance and because I got along with both of them, the rest of the class treated me the same way as they treated them. Though, I felt that I didn’t deserve that treatment because I didn’t look as good as them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing much, it’s just… Have you done your assignment for the fifth period?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? What assignment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fifth period would be math. The teacher in charge was known to be a strict person and they wouldn’t hesitate to lower your grades if you missed out an assignment from them. But, I didn’t remember anything about us having any assignments today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tilted my head in confusion, Yuuka giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, you haven’t done it. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> gave it to us near the end of the period. You probably didn’t hear it because you were sleeping back then, also because I forgot to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait a minute… Are you for real?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina suddenly cut into our conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face looked pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Sorry, I forgot to tell you too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, it isn’t your fault, Yuuka-chan, it was my fault that I dozed off the other day! Ugh, what should I do? Can I make it in time if I start doing it now?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch, who was invited to lunch by Hina, was listening to our conversation with a blank stare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Shiina-san! I have to do my assignment first, so go ahead and eat without me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She apologized to the witch and hurriedly took out her math textbook and notebook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina is an earnest student, isn’t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka giggled after seeing that scene, meanwhile Shinji and I just shrugged our shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl doesn’t know how to give up. It’s at times like this that we should just accept our fates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, right? Then again, I know about the assignment, but why the hell would I do math, ew.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, what was that, Shinji? If you knew about it, then why didn’t you tell me about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would I do that, my dear best friend? If I’m going to get scolded, then obviously I’ll drag you with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a delinquent like you! Stop treating me like one! I’m an honor student!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honor students wouldn’t skip classes like you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji as he let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even retort to that because he was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuuka-chan is teaching me, you guys should join in too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> didn’t give us a lot of problems to solve. We should be able to finish it during the lunch break if we do our best!~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked around the class, there were many classmates that had put their lunches away and were working on the math’s assignment. Yuuka must have been telling them about the assignments. This was why everyone adored her, she was so kind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you an idiot, Hina? To do the assignments, I have to solve the problems and to do that I have to understand the question first. I have been sleeping in class for the past few weeks, so I know literally nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not something to brag about!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instead of worrying about me, you should worry about yourself. You haven’t done anything yourself, have you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to tell me that!&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina as she scribbled through her notebook with her pen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll show you mine, so you should work on yours too, Godou-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka pulled out her assignment and gave it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, my goddess…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Goddess really existed in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in the other world, they only exist as a false image that was created by the church.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re overreacting… Next time, do it on your own, okay? Promise me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a gesture as if I was praying to her and she giggled when she saw it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that’s not fair! Yuuka-chan, you’re spoiling him too much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s just how deep the bond between me and Yuuka is. You just don’t have enough affection points with her, that’s why she didn’t show her assignment to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What affection points?! This isn’t a game!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, I just thought that Hina is able to solve the problems normally, so she doesn’t need to look at mine…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka hurriedly defended herself. Seeing this, Shinji crossed his arms and spoke,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, no choice then. If the answer is right in front of me like this, then I’ll have to do it even if I don’t want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with that haughty tone of yours?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph, unlike you and your stupid bond or whatever, I’ll be paying her for her kindness. So, how much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… Just buy me some juice later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that exchange happened, we quickly put our lunches away and pulled out our notebooks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch looked at us and asked,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is it okay if I don’t do the assignment?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> wouldn’t be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> heartless to scold a new student about an old assignment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see. S-Sorry, I asked something strange…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, don’t be! Also, relax, don’t be so nervous!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka tried to be as gentle as possible when talking to her, but the witch was still tense when talking to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When our eyes involuntarily met, she glared at me though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it so hard to just act like how she acted around me instead of acting meekly like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After things had quietened down, the witch pulled out a book and started to read it. She looked relaxed when she did it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reading a book on the first day you transferred in? …I mean, it wasn’t a bad thing, but doing that would just make it harder for you to make friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! Somehow, I finished everything…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished the assignment quickly. It was all thanks to Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I finished it faster than you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji with a smirk as he crossed his arms. So what?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While taking back her notebook, Yuuka whispered something to us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> prefers to be alone? Did I do something unnecessary?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved her gaze toward the witch, who was absorbed in her book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I don’t know… I think we were too pushy, after all…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina with a complicated look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both her and Yuuka had been trying their best so that the new student could get used to the new environment quickly, but they started to think that their plan backfired and blamed themselves because said new student looked so uncomfortable around them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, that wasn’t the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch was just too used to being alone. She had been living alone for half of her life and she knew how to deal with that kind of solitude. That was why she looked relaxed when she was reading a book on her own like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, just because she was used to being alone, that didn’t mean that she liked being alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, that girl, Cerys Flores, hated to be alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She longed for the warmth of family, friends or any kind of human interaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her lack of communication skill as well as the trauma of being detested as a witch made it hard for her to interact with other people. She was afraid that someone might come to hate her. That was the reason behind her nervousness and anxiety whenever there were other people around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a special case because we were originally enemies. She could act haughtily because she didn’t care if I were to hate her. Or rather, we were supposed to hate each other to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I wanted everyone to talk to her more so that she could overcome her trauma, but it would be really unnatural if I were to ask them to do it openly like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, Godou, don’t you know Shiina-san? So, what’s with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Shinji said that to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained to Yuuka and Hina that I knew the witch for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should talk to the witch later so that we could elaborate a proper backstory to tell everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, I see. So that’s why you two got along quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I didn’t notice that it was her at first, but when we talked earlier I managed to confirm that it was really her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went on and explained to everyone. They were all the centers of the class, so if they understood the witch’s personality, everyone else would also understand and they wouldn’t isolate nor avoid her because of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl isn’t very talkative, but she does like to be around other people, so don’t hesitate to talk to her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was busy trying to explain her circumstances, the witch was reading without care. Since her attitude pissed me off, I gave her a rough poke in the shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m trying so hard to make some friends for you and here you are lost in your own world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t tell you to do something like that, though?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone saw how she was yelling at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, I see. So that’s how it is, huh, Shiina-san?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina stared at her in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, you two look like you’re about to enter your own world… Should we give you two some space?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka while giggling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, anyway, that’s the kind of girl she is. Just think of her as a really shy girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, what are you saying about me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch tried to argue, but her voice gradually became quieter as she noticed everyone’s stare. In the end, she fell into silence mid-sentence. Of course, I laughed at her in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right after that, the bell rang, signaling the end of the lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to get through the fifth period with no problem and proceeded to sleep through the sixth period. Time passed and it was currently after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed my pencil case in my backpack and threw the rest of my things, textbooks and notebooks, into my locker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I would be in trouble if a teacher discovered me doing this, but it was too troublesome to bring them home. Besides, I didn’t study at home anyway, so this was more convenient for me. (T/N: The raw used the term </span><span style="font-weight: 400">置き勉 (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Okiben</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) here. It’s the term for leaving all your books at school so you don’t need to bring any of them home. In Japanese it’s frowned upon to do it and only ‘delinquents’ would do it. Anyway, I left the term out in the translation because I found no English equivalent of it.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I finished packing up, I looked at the witch, who was fiddling with her phone in her seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, see you later, Godou-kun. I have to go to my club.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going ahead, Godou. I wanna stop by the arcade today. See ya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my hand in response to Yuuka and Shinji’s goodbyes. Then, I went to the witch’s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, what are you up to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She yelped in surprise when I called out to her. What the hell? Was she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> absorbed in her phone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I asked, what are you up to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw her phone screen, she was looking at her ‘RINE’. (T/N: It’s LINE, a messaging app that’s popular in Japan.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought she was texting someone, but after taking a closer look, she was actually staring at the app’s home screen. The top of the screen showed ‘Friends (4)’ with two of the contacts listed as ‘New Friends’. From the familiar profile picture of the two contacts, I could safely assume that they were Hina and Yuuka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch quickly hid her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glared at me. I could see a slight tint of pink in her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What? Don’t give me that pitying look!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see tears forming in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I thought she was up to something, but she was just giddy because the number of her RINE friends increased. I guess I could safely assume that the other two contacts she had in her friend list were her parents’. Well, it was good that she got along well with her parents, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have anything to say, say it to my face!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no… I mean… I guess… Good for you? Um, do your best out there, okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say that! You’re just making me look pitiful!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want me to say then?! You’re such a troublesome woman…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about not peeking into other people’s phones without their permission?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that was a good argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad… But still, I didn’t expect to see that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even the way you apologize pisses me off…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch gritted her teeth as she glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, friends were about quality and not quantity, so the number of friends you had shouldn’t matter, but… Her having only four friends in her RINE meant that she didn’t have any friends from her previous school, right? …No, I should stop thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I heard a light-hearted voice coming from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina came into the classroom while slinging her bag over her shoulders. She noticed the teary-eyed witch and furrowed her brows at the sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? Was Godou bullying you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, n-no… T-There was dust… In my eyes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the witch was making a random excuse, someone else entered the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked over and saw a girl carrying a huge pile of handouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> forgot to hand these over!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gait was unsteady when she said that sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she wanted to place the handouts on the teacher’s desk, but because of her posture, what she did looked dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through my trained eyes, I managed to predict what would happen to her in the next few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this continued, she would fall over and the handouts would scatter all over the floor. There was also a possibility that her head would hit a nearby desk .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oi, watch out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her and dashed toward her. Right at that moment…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, she tried to correct her posture, but her action was counterproductive and made her completely lose her balance instead. In the end, she fell over while letting out a scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to go over there normally, I wouldn’t make it in time to save her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I decided to push my body to the limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still had the body of a normal high school student, but I could temporarily remove the limiter from my brain to enhance the physical capabilities of my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed the pile of handouts with my right arm and caught the girl’s waist with my other hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I corrected my body’s posture so that I could hold the handouts properly with my right hand and pulled the girl closer to me with my other hand so she wouldn’t fall over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Huh?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl stared at me with a puzzled expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I felt a sharp pain in my ankle. I guess I sprained it, huh? Well, that was a given for doing something like that without any warmups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to ignore the pain and called out to the girl,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? Can you stand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! U-Um… S-Sorry for troubling you! A-And, t-thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl was Sasayama Miki. She was one of my classmates, but I haven’t talked to her much. She was close with Hina, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re okay, then that&#8217;s good. Be careful next time, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let Sasayama go and patted her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! T-Thank you, Shiraishi-kun! I saw my life flashing before me for a second there…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina then rushed to Sasayama’s side and asked her about her condition. In response, Sasayama smiled at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not bad, Godou.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A man’s gotta look cool once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders in response to Hina’s praise before placing the handouts on the teacher’s desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In exchange for that ‘cool act’ I sprained my ankle though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike my previous life, I had a much harder time helping people because of this body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, even though I retained all my combat experiences and reflexes, my current body was still that of a high school boy. I could raise my physical capabilities like what I did just now, but my whole body would hurt all over if I did it for a long period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went back to the witch’s side, she was giving me a blank stare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That habit of yours still hasn&#8217;t changed, huh? Is your leg okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, you noticed, as expected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my legs a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not a big deal. I’ll just need to smear it with some poultice and it’ll heal in a few days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you walk home with that leg?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My house is nearby, so yeah, of course. Don’t worry about me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This level of pain wouldn’t bother me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to my previous life, I was subjected to a lot of things more painful than this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not worried about you or anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her head away with a ‘hmph’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou, we’re going to our club! See you later!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um, thank you again, Shiraishi-kun! I’ll repay you properly next time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Hina and Sasayama ran out of the room. They seemed to be in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were both in the track club and they were probably running out late for their club activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of our classmates had either gone home or went to their clubs. Some of them were still talking in the hallways, but there were only me and the witch inside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, are you planning to enter a club?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked the witch. She turned her face away in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If there’s a literature club, maybe… I don’t want to join any clubs related to sports…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Figures. You’re hopeless in that regard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up. Don’t compare me with a muscle-brain like you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who do you call a muscle-brain?! Anyway, the literature club was shut down a while back. They didn’t manage to get enough active members.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Then, I won’t be joining any clubs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure? Joining one is the easiest way to get more friends, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, that isn’t any of your business! You’re preaching to me about clubs and whatnot, what about you? Why are you still here? Don’t tell me you didn’t actually join any clubs after all that preaching?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I did. The going-home club. Let me welcome you to the club, newbie.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t need your welcome. Also, why are you still here? Go home already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, I’m here because of you. Didn’t you ask me to dispel your curse?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words, the witch nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wasn’t the purpose of her transferring in to dispel her curse? How could she just casually forget about it like this? Was her head okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, firstly, let’s move elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she was the witch, but it still felt embarrassing that she thoughtlessly invited me to her room like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Do you have a problem with it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aren’t your parents home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, they are not. I planted a suggestion in their mind to send me here by myself using magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, what the hell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, I had no other choice, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She snorted before continuing,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you going to do? I don’t want to invite you either, so if you have a good place for us to do it, I’ll be okay going there with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Look at this girl… Acting haughtily when asking someone for a favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, since you’re living by yourself, might as well. It isn’t like I can use my power anywhere else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I wasn’t sure if I could use my exorcism or not. But, if the witch’s theory was correct, I should be able to do it no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I still couldn’t use it anywhere I wanted. In order to dispel the curse out of her body, I still needed to make physical contact with her so I could interact with her mana and make a pathway for me to inject my power. Holding her hand should suffice, but there was no way I’d do it in public. Aside from that, I had to concentrate when using my power, so a quiet place was more preferable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s finish this troublesome business as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my back to the witch and walked away. She followed behind me quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Anyway, um, why aren’t you in a club?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s fitting for a muscle-brain like you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean a muscle-brain like me? Just because you’re bad at physical activities doesn’t mean–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the witch stopped walking. When I turned around, she was crouching while holding his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a pillar right in front of her. I guess she bumped into it somehow, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What the hell are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, she stared at me with teary eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was just walking normally! Don’t mind me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could still act like this, amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always acted haughtily like this in the other world as a self-defense mechanism but it seemed like that habit carried away even in a peaceful world like this. It wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, but well…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Don’t touch me!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved her hair out of the way with my hand and took a look at her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, you got a bump.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You’re too close! Don’t you know there is something called sexual harrassment in this world?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That doesn’t apply to you, specifically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I obviously wouldn’t touch another girl’s forehead. The witch was an exception. Wait, actually, I wouldn’t mind doing it to Hina because she was my childhood friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That aside, where’s your house? Is it close to school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It’s within a walking distance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s awfully close…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My parents made me live near the school because they were worried about me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. They really love you, don’t they?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, the witch furrowed her brows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They love me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. They are worried about you because they love you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re just worried out of obligation because I’m their daughter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch in a hurry, as if to cut me out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she said that sentence bothered me. I stopped walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… What are you?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she was implying that if she wasn’t their daughter, they wouldn’t care about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You won’t understand how I feel. Everyone looks up to you. They need you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a faint smile as she said that. Just like back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess… You’re right…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was chosen as a hero to lead the people around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I’ve killed countless demons and saved countless people, everyone put their hopes in my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I didn’t understand the witch’s feelings. After all, unlike me, she was hated by everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I still had a complaint about my situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, they only sought after me because of my power. They depended on me because I was capable. No one cared about me because of who I was. That was the kind of existence I was… And that’s the reason why they killed me in the end…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if that was the case…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch trailed off her sentence and broke into a mysterious smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what kind of feelings were hidden behind that smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I still envied you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the enemy of the world, the root of all calamities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch who received the hatred of everyone in the world, let out a bewitching smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just kidding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shadow of her past self overlapped with the girl standing in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t really care about all that stuff. Let’s get going, we’ve wasted enough time already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch flipped her hair and walked toward the school building’s entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she suddenly turned back with a blank face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she passed by in front of me, she let out a cough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed my forehead with my hand involuntarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You forgot to change your shoes, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Look, everyone did that once in a while! …Right?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least be firm when making your argument, jeez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not me for sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that this happened after a serious talk like that made me feel embarrassed… Wait, why was I the one getting embarrassed from her antics? Give me a break…</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know… Just… Hang in there, Witch…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m only like this because I’ve been nervous for the whole day, okay? …I think…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the witch who was trying hard to defend herself and went outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took a step outside, a wave of heat enveloped my whole body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like the sun was trying to burn my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Summer has arrived, huh? There was no better explanation other than this. Even though it wasn’t long since I left the school building, sweat already started coming out from my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, the energetic voices of the baseball and soccer club members could be heard from the direction of the field. How could they run around in this kind of weather? I’d rather stay inside my house while eating some ice cream instead of torturing myself like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s so hot…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch brushed her hair off her face and fanned her chest lightly with her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? Do you think I’ll collapse from the heat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That isn’t impossible. Back in the other world, the heat never got this bad. Summer in Japan is nuts…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, isn’t that because we lived in the north? Maybe it was like this too in the south.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only traveled around the land of the Holy Augusria Empire, the de facto ruler of the northern region. Aside from that, I went to its vassal states too, mainly the Mariano Federation. The furthest region to the south I went into would be when I was raiding a dungeon in the Istria Kingdom, but that kingdom was located on the border between the north and the center of the continent. (T/N: アウグスリア (Augusria), マリヤノ (Mariano), イストレ (Istria))</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While reminiscing about my previous life, I went to the bicycle parking lot. The witch’s house was within a walking distance, meanwhile mine was a bit far. It took me twenty minutes to get there with a bike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the parking lot, I saw some of my fellow going-home club members hanging around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See ya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed my bike out the gate after that. I said my goodbye early so they wouldn’t go out of their way to invite me to go home together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the witch was walking a few meters behind me so people wouldn’t notice that we were going home together. While I didn’t mind her doing that, I didn’t know where her house was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her for directions with my gaze and she confirmed it with hers, so I boldly walked toward said direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, we reached the crossroad. It seemed like the witch decided that she didn’t need to watch out for other people’s gazes anymore, so she came forward and walked by my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we walked together in complete silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I didn’t feel like saying anything to my former nemesis, at the same time, I also wanted to talk about a lot of things with her. While I was contemplating that silly thing, the witch suddenly stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said nonchalantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing was, the place she pointed to was a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> luxurious apartment. The idea that a single student would be living there was just so outlandish because of how expensive it looked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eh, are you serious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? Why are you making that dumb face?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at me, the witch tilted her head in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your parents… Are they like, filthy rich or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? I don’t know… They’re just, normal?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch said, looking puzzled. She then proceeded to take out a card and swiped it in front of the front door. The door then opened soon afterwards and we were greeted by a really spacious lobby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, a mere commoner, could do nothing but tremble and let out a weak voice at this sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch, not noticing the state I was in, quickly got into the lift. I hurriedly followed her behind. I didn’t want to be left behind by her and get caught by the guards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is amazing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the elevator was a wall made of tempered glass. We could see the whole city from here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been overreacting about the silliest things since a while ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch, shrugging her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! I was born into a normal family, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than making fun of me, she just didn’t understand what was amazing about her situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because she had no friends, she wasn’t aware that the environment she lived in wasn’t a normal one at all. Years of failure in socializing resulted in her lack of common sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your lack of common sense hasn&#8217;t changed at all, huh? This is why you should try and socialize with more people so you could learn about the world you’re living in properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch had an uneasy look on her face. Maybe my words were finally getting through her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, stop reading books everywhere you go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m not doing that! B-Besides, I’m learning about this world through those books!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away with a ‘hmph’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the lift stopped. I didn’t even know how many floors we had passed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch got off the lift and unlocked the door to a room at the end of the hallway and entered it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want you to be here, but go in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry for intruding…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I followed the witch fearfully and entered the room, the smell of books entered my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were several bookshelves lining up on the walls of the spacious room. All of them were completely filled with books. Hell, there were even some books that couldn’t fit in the shelves because there wasn’t enough space. Those books were stacked neatly on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the center of the room, there was a table, surrounded by two sofas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch sat down on one of them and I sat down on the sofa opposite of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This room is so big…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was spacious, but it felt suffocating to me. Maybe that was because of my commoner soul freaking out. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in my previous life, I didn’t live in this much luxury. Yes, they provided me with a private room that was as big as this room because I was a hero, but I didn’t use it much since I had to travel around a lot. I used to sleep in cheap inns instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, don’t you think there’s too many books here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It can’t be helped, okay? There’s so many interesting books in this world.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch as she averted her gaze from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlike back in the previous world, the books here are cheap and my family would buy me as many books as I want…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, she was also a bookworm back in the previous world. But since paper was scarce over there, books were absurdly expensive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took a closer look, there were a lot of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and light novels on the bookshelves. There were other things too, such as historical documentaries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed that there were more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shounen</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and light novels than anything there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It can’t be helped, okay?! T-The storybooks in this world are interesting!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t say anything, but she started to defend herself all of a sudden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve always liked stories like this, right? I remember your eyes would shine brightly whenever you were listening to the bards’ stories. I know you love heroic tales like knights slaying evil dragons and such…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt nostalgic. Imagine the bards’ reaction if they found out that the young woman who had been frolicking like a child around them was the Witch of Calamity herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ahem. I’m going to make some tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps remembering that dark history of hers, the witch blushed and cleared out her throat. Then, she got up from her seat and returned not too long after with two cups in her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I was not welcome here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still a guest, this is just basic manners. If you don’t want it, just throw it away then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No no, thank you for the hospitality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch said in a dismissive tone and sat on the sofa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her manners and gestures were elegant and beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since she was a rich young lady, she must’ve been properly educated from a young age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish she would show this much elegance when talking to people other than me, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I were admiring her beauty, suddenly the witch exclaimed,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch who had just sipped her tea was currently sticking out her tongue. Tears started to form in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ahem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, my impression of you was ruined already, clearing your throat wouldn’t fix that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, she couldn’t take hot food too back in the day. (T/N: 猫舌 (neko-jita) meaning cat-tongued. There’s no proper equivalent of it in English, but it’s a metaphor for a person who can’t take hot food.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’ll let it cool down first…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch turned her gaze to the window, trying to hide her embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently sipped my tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, yes, it’s a good tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know my tea, but it must have been an expensive one. The fact that it was expensive meant that it was a good tea. So, I should act like I knew a lot about tea here and gave it the praise it deserved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just instant tea I bought from the convenience store, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, what the hell? Why are you bringing out a commoner’s product all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t know anything about tea, do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch shrugged her shoulders and placed her cup down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I think it’s time for us to start.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you acting haughtily when you’re the one asking me a favor?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, be more humble about it at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whose fault do you think it is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so… Well, whatever, it feels disgusting if you treat me politely anyway. Besides, this is something that I gotta do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch stood up and sat down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she had an ulterior motive for a second there, then I realized that she did it so we could start dispelling her curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay, you can start whenever you feel like it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, her voice cracked a little and her face was red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Seeing her like this made me feel conscious over the fact that I was currently inside the room of a girl classmate and I was sitting really close to her. Calm down, it was just the witch, don’t get any strange ideas…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Alright, let’s do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch leaned even closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A soft, sweet scent tickled my nostrils.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her scent made me feel nervous. Even though I was a hero in my first life, I was still currently a high school boy. Even though I knew that she was the witch, I still felt nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t take my eyes off her. Everything about her drew me in from her long eyelashes, her clear and beautiful eyes, her pure white skin…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was an immensely beautiful girl. She was a beauty in her previous life, but she was blessed with such a pretty face in this life too. Though, unlike her previous life, her current appearance could be classified as ‘cute’ rather than ‘pretty’. Her petite body only raised that impression further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What is it? C-Could you stop staring at me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch stared at me with a shy face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A-Ahem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her expression, I came to my senses and let out a cough, trying to brush everything off. We were doing this because of the curse, nothing more. I needed to stop thinking about weird things!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m going to hold your hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice trembled as she said that, probably out of nervousness. Then, she proceeded to touch my hand before immediately pulling away while letting out a small shriek. She attempted to do it again, slower, and managed to grasp my hand properly. I could feel the warmth of her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand was thin and small. It felt like it would break if I were to squeeze it tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was worried about the possibility of my hand being sweaty and making her uncomfortable but then, I realized that she was the witch and I didn’t need to show her that much consideration. I let out a sigh and that made my shoulder move a little. Thanks to that, it grazed the witch’s shoulder and she yelped in surprise because of it. What the hell was that reaction?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is this really necessary?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Look, I don’t want to do this either, but it’s the necessary procedure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to her being all embarrassed, the embarrassment spread to me and made my voice tremble as I talked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was pounding so hard to the point that I suspected that the witch could hear it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt sweat start to form in the hand that the witch was holding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I should calm myself and focus on dispelling her curse. I closed my eyes and tried to use my power.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“O, evil that lies deep inside…”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chant. A ritual using words as its medium. (T/N: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">詠唱 (Eisho) was used here. It could also mean ‘aria’, but ‘chant’ felt less mouthful.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was used to activate the power of exorcism, the power to interfere with the cursed mana that was sleeping within the witch’s soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pre-requirements of exorcism was the absence of mana within oneself. To be precise, only people with a unique constitution that rejected magic could use it. That was the reason why the witch couldn’t use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, exorcism still required mana as its power source. To be exact, it used the mana of the exorcism subject as its power source. In this case, I was using the witch’s mana. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Show your form before me.”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the chant was finished, the exorcism spell was perfectly formed without any issues using the mana that the witch had in her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh of relief. There was no problem so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like as long as there was a curse to be dispelled, exorcism could be used in this world. The witch was confident that it would be the case, but I wasn’t since I was born in a different body compared to my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, let’s do this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, that was just the opening act. This was where the real thing began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to secure a connection with the witch’s soul, so I only needed to remove her curse now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I wasn’t careful, the curse might afflict me as well, so this was the part where I needed to concentrate the most.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about that, something murky and dark entered my consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is this?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a closer look at it, I realized that it was the curse itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But its form was abnormally huge and dense. It was hard to believe that this kind of curse even existed. The curse was bound tightly to the pure white soul of the witch’s. Even now, it was slowly eroding her soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It was worse than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aware of its existence back in the other world but, back then, the curse’s erosion hadn&#8217;t reached this far. The light of her soul was barely hanging in there as almost every inch of it was contaminated by the curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, what the hell happened to you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dragged my consciousness back to reality, only to find that she was shutting both her eyes and her mouth, probably out of consideration for me. Acknowledging her intention, I decided to finish my business first.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“My miracle shall purify every impurity…”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be impossible to purify everything at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only do it little by little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the exorcism was done, I returned my consciousness back to reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch was breathing roughly and it was clear that she was in pain. Maybe it was the side effect of me touching her soul directly. She noticed that I had finished my job for now and thanked me, albeit with difficulty, as she still hadn&#8217;t managed to catch her breath yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked really out of it. Her body was limp as she leaned against me. I decided to get up and laid her down on the sofa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down. First, try to catch your breath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Replied the witch before she took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…That was strange. I’ve done this a lot of times back in the other world, but she never ended up in this state. Was it because the curse’s erosion was worse than back then?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the curse that would bind its victim’s soul, damage it and eventually kill it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, thanks to her curse resistance, the erosion didn’t get too far. No matter how potent the curse was, the witch was able to resist it to the point that it wasn’t affecting her life at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the reason why she could afford to worry about what happened after her death. Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to stand such a heinous curse. They would die instantly the moment it made contact with their souls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…So, what was going on with her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that her reincarnation made her curse resistance weaker?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, wait, I guess this was just how things should be, huh? It had been sixteen years since she was reborn to this world, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I didn’t know what happened to her during those sixteen years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you really okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, the witch furrowed her eyebrows and stared at me with suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about? I’m clearly not okay, that’s why I’m asking for your help to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know that’s not what I’m talking about…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you talking about the erosion? …Well, everything will be fine. My lifespan will be shortened a bit, but that’s all there is to it. If you dispel the curse properly, I should be alright… Maybe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Maybe’? What do you mean?! Stop talking about your own life lightly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like I said, you don’t need to worry about anything. Besides, we aren’t in the kind of relationship where we could afford to worry about each other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to scold her, she immediately cut me off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth to try and refute her words, but I couldn’t say anything to her. After all, her words were true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Witch, are you?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no reason to tell you anything. Remember that we are just in a cooperative relationship because our goal is the same, there’s nothing more to it. Just like in the other world. Got it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch seemed to know what I wanted to say and cut me off mid-sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care about what kind of relationship we are in! I’m just worried about you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? You’re not a hero anymore, are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I heard those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unconsciously held my breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right. I was no longer a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heroic Grey Handlet was no more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My current identity was Shiraishi Godou, an ordinary high school boy who lived in Japan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reason for me to worry about my old nemesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence enveloped the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I remained silent, the witch whispered something to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From today onwards, you have to do this once every three days. I know this is a hassle, but this is the price you have to pay for not killing me on that day… That’s why, I won’t thank you for this no matter what…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Got it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mention the fact that she thanked me earlier. Maybe she did it unconsciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’m going home then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have finished my business here and it wasn’t like she’d answer my questions even if I asked her anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I had a part time job at seven, so I should get back home quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was only one problem, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared at the witch blankly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a ‘hmph’ when she noticed my gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing… Just… When will you let go of my hand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when I tried to pull it away, she held it so tightly that it couldn’t even budge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch stared at our intertwined hands. She finally realized what she had been doing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, she yanked her hand away and quickly backed away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-W-Wha…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to overreact like that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled wryly at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was still the same old witch. This clumsy side of her just never changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, see you at school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drank the rest of the tea, which had gotten cold at this point, and left the witch’s room.</span></p>

p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back home on my bike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was almost time for my part-time job to start, but I still had to go back home to change my clothes first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my sprained ankle, it took me longer than usual to get home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said as I unlocked the door to my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that was just out of habit more than anything since no one was currently at home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both my parents were working. My dad worked in another city and my mom wouldn’t be back until late at night. I have an older sister, but she was living on her own since she was a college student already. That was why whenever I went back from school, there would be no one to welcome me home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed the stairs and walked to my room in the corner of the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to the witch’s room, it was just a normal boy’s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a bed, a study desk, a chair, a drawer and a small bookshelf inside. There were only five or six </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and novels lined up in the bookshelf, a stark difference between the witch’s numerous book collections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops, I needed to stop thinking about such things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up a uniform for my part-time job and rushed out of the house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My current destination was a family restaurant in front of the station. I had several part-time jobs, but I had the most shifts there because it paid better than my other jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heya, Shiraishi-senpai~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was on my way, I suddenly heard someone calling my name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see a girl in glasses waving at me. Her chestnut colored hair was tied neatly in a ponytail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kawasaki? You have a shift today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl was Kawasaki Saya, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">at my part-time job and a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kouhai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> at my school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes? Didn’t I tell you about this yesterday?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pouted, placed her hands on her hips and proceeded to reprimand me. Her gesture seemed like she was trying to seduce me or something and I was aware that she was the kind of girl who’d actually do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think I’d remember everything that you told me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, she talked to me all the time during work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was too sleepy to listen to her properly, so it was a given that I didn’t remember everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You’re so mean, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> You’re going to make me cry! Boohoo, I’m crying! You’re making your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kouhai </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">cry, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">! Now, you have to comfort me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re really crying, sure, I’ll do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m crying! See? There are tears in my eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, you could actually cry on demand like that? You should try to be an actress, you’ll make it big.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, it’s just my hay fever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I’ll take my praises back. Come to think of it, it’s already summer, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. By the way, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, do you know that if you have a severe hay fever, no matter what the season is, you’ll still burst into tears?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwah, that sounds horrible…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made it up just now though, I don’t actually have hay fever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, this conversation is a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, this is why I like you, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. You always go along with my jokes~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki laughed as she teased me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being teased by someone younger like her put a dent to my pride, but seeing her smile made me just want to let her off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curse that pretty face, it was so unfair. It was the same with the witch too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, don’t you think you have too many shifts these days?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you need more time to study? Final exam is just around the corner, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, right, I forgot that was a thing. It will start next week too. If I didn’t want to get red marks, I needed to study properly this week. Ugh, what a pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is my last day. I’ll be taking a break until the end of the exam!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got it good, huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">? Can’t you just do the same?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t. The manager asked me to. I mean, there are a lot of students like us working there, right? We’d be short-staffed around this time, so I had no choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth was, I just forgot that we’d be having our final exam soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders as Kawasaki looked at me, clearly unconvinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can just refuse him like I did, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlike you, I don’t really care about my grades. So I don’t mind doing it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I literally just remembered about the exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Jeez, fine, do whatever you like, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were having our conversation, we entered the family restaurant building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Kawasaki stopped as something came to her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;By the way, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, is your leg okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, you noticed? It’s nothing big, I just bumped into something. Laugh at me if you want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…She was surprisingly sharp, huh? So far, only the witch noticed it, but that was a given since she was THE witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki then fell into silence for a while before eventually sighing in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Please don’t overdo it, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop overreacting. ‘Tis but a scratch, I can handle this, no problem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was happy that she was concerned about me, but I had never pushed myself ever since I reincarnated to this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike back then, I only did whatever I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The work at my part-time job was divided into two, the kitchen and the front side. Since I could do both, my role was to fill in whichever of the two that was short-staffed. Today, it would be the front side, meaning I would be the waiter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, the number of people started increasing as soon as dinner time started. Since the restaurant was located right in front of the station, we got more customers than normal restaurants did. It was hard dealing with so many people at once, especially since we were always short-staffed, but since the pay was so good, the job wasn’t so bad. One thousand yen per hour wage was rare in this prefecture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome. Table for how many people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my previous life experience, I could actually guess from their footsteps how many people would come into the restaurant. In this case, there were four people. By the way, I could still do this even when this place was crowded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the battlefield, there were countless times when I had to fight while being deprived of sight, so I had to understand the situation around me using my other senses, mainly hearing. The reason why I was so strong back then wasn’t because of my strength, swordsmanship nor exorcism, but because of my unnaturally sharp five senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was reincarnated, my five senses still retained that sharpness, which was quite a curious thing to happen. You’d thought that you wouldn’t retain your senses if you moved to a different body, but here we are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to serve the customers while thinking about such things. There were more people than usual today and sadly, we weren’t able to serve them all because of the lack of manpower. Gradually, the number of customers who were waiting in the waiting area had increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for waiting, here’s your order.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Kawasaki and I did our job well, but there was a newcomer who did a rather poor job in comparison. Though, she did quite well for a newcomer. I believe her name was… Takase-san?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, things are looking quite bad here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of the chaos, Kawasaki approached me and talked to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are so many customers waiting… And some of them seem dangerous…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, there were some nasty-looking people waiting in the waiting area looking annoyed. I understood their feelings though, I hated waiting too. Imagine waiting for dozens of minutes just to eat at a family restaurant, couldn’t be me. Well, if it was a delicious </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> shop instead, I would wait for it even if it took hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we can’t help it. The kitchen is having a hard time too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how good we were at serving the customers, it wouldn’t make the situation in the kitchen any better. They were currently overwhelmed with the huge number of orders. I could go there to help them but, if I were to do that, the front side would be overwhelmed instead. Like I said many times, we were short-staffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about that,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crisp, high-pitched sound echoed through the room. When I turned around, I saw the newcomer fall to the floor. It seemed like she was in the middle of carrying an order as the floor around her was filled with scattered food and broken plate’s shards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You f**k…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, some of the food was splattered on the pants of someone who was waiting in the waiting area. Unluckily for her, he was one of the nasty-looking guys Kawasaki mentioned earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m truly sorry!—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think an apology is enough?! You’ve made me wait for so long and now this!—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takase-san was apologizing desperately, but the customer was having none of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-This is bad, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Kawasaki with a pale face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran over to Takase-san’s side to help her apologize to that customer only to see him kicking one of the intact plates on the ground toward her direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to catch the flying plate right before it hit her. Thankfully, I was able to read his action before he actually did it. Takase-san stared at the scene in front of her in a daze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, my foot slipped, just like that woman over there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man looked surprised over the fact that I managed to grab the plate, but he casually acted like he didn’t do it on purpose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Was this guy for real? Did he realize that if it actually hit her, we could charge him for assault?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was the other world, this kind of behavior would be acceptable, but pulling something like this in this world? I could only see people who did this as idiots. Having this behavior in a world with established laws was foolish, the risk was too high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m sorry, but this area is dangerous because of the broken plate shards. For some reason they can fly around on their own too, so can you sirs move to another place for a moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I couldn’t treat him roughly since I managed to stop him and he also claimed it as an accident. Besides, the first mistake was from our side, not theirs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I gave him some concessions by saying that… But it seemed like this guy was dumber than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F**ker, don’t get carried away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either he was pissed because of my dismissive attitude or was just blinded by his rage. Whatever the reason was, he grabbed my collar and pulled me close to him. In that instance, the surroundings started to buzz loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oi, Masato… I-I think you’re going too far…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His friends stepped forward, trying to stop him. They looked like a dangerous bunch, but at least they knew that they were really pushing it by doing this. The only idiot in their group was this Masato guy, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Takase-san, who had been in a daze, stood up and bowed her head again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um, I-I’m really sorry, everything is my fault, s-so if you want to blame someone–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a good girl. If I was in her shoes, I wouldn’t even bother apologizing to him. But I guess she was trying to make him release me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if things proceeded to what she wanted, his anger would shift back to her again and I didn’t want that to happen. It was fine if he were to attack me, but if he were to attack Takase-san instead, it would be troubling. Who knows what kind of things this idiot would do, so I didn’t dare to take any risks here. I snorted at him to agitate him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That action managed to make him lose all his patience. He punched me as hard as he could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could dodge it easily, but that would be counterproductive. So, I decided to take the hit, deflected the impact and threw myself on the floor to turn this into a bigger scene. As soon as that happened, the female customers around us started screaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S-Senpai?!”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki was about to come over, but I stopped her with a gesture and told her that I was fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who punched me realized what happened and his expression turned really ugly, as if he chewed a bitter pill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch, you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he immediately stormed out of the restaurant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His friends followed suit not long after.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that was that. Problem solved, I guess…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh of relief and called out to Takase-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded her head, tears welling up in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after that, she said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Rather than me, are you okay, Shiraishi-san?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled to reassure her that she didn’t need to worry about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine. I’m quite strong, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That punch didn’t even hurt me in the first place. I just made it seem like a big deal to make them leave the place quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean you’re fine? Look at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about such things, Kawasaki grabbed my hand in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at my hand closely, I could see blood dripping from it. A cut? Did I hit a shard when I did that act? Great, I made a fool out of myself then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Tis just a scratch. Don’t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still had to treat it quickly or else it’ll be a hindrance for my job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What do you mean?! Y-You’re bleeding a lot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takase-san shouted with a face that looked like she was about to cry soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It really wasn’t a big of a deal though. I wouldn’t die from this much. I knew exactly how much blood you’d need to drain to kill someone, thanks to my previous world experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… Doesn’t it hurt?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asked Kawasaki in a worried voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“This much pain is nothing, I can barely even feel it. I’m fine, I’ll fix this up real quick.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled to reassure her and went toward the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My words were true. I received a much more grievous wound than this back in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to those, this kind of wound was nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, it was great that everyone was okay after all that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, my experience from my previous life could come in handy this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could use it to help other people in this world too, I couldn’t be happier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the police visited my workplace and interrogated me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it turned into a bigger deal than I thought, I had to go home later than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is the bandage really necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it is! You bled a lot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared helplessly at my bandaged arm as Kawasaki said those words firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just putting some spit on it should cure it in a jiffy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because you’re saying such stupid things that is why I’m doing this for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“*Sigh*&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like my standard became too twisted for this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I remembered about my previous life, I started thinking with the mindset of someone who lived in the other world more. Back then, bar fights were common occurrences and no one made a big deal out of them, but here, it was the total opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mind about anything that happened, but Takase-san was crying while apologizing to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, are you used to fighting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What made you think so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her question with a question of my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do I say this… Back then, even in that kind of situation, you didn’t seem to panic at all…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there was no reason for me to be wary of those kinds of small fries. No matter how weak my current body was, I could beat them all on my own if I wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if I actually tried to fight back and win, I would be in the wrong, thanks to the law of this country. That was why I decided to just let him hit me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, if I was actually panicking in that kind of situation, I’d be disqualified as a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think I’m a delinquent?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked while picking up an empty can that was sitting by the side of the road and threw it into a nearby trash can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made a loud noise as it hit the bottom of the trash can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t seem like one… Are you a rehabilitated delinquent by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Besides, I’ve never got into a fight in my whole life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders as I said that. It was true, I had never got into a fight in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki didn’t seem to be convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re keeping a lot of secrets, huh, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I wasn’t trying to keep everything a secret, but if I were to tell any sane person in this world about me being a hero of another world and that I was reincarnated here for some reason, nobody would believe me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I brushed her off with a mysterious smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki furrowed her brows. This was getting a little hard to handle… I should try to change the topic… It was at that time, I noticed an old woman carrying a lot of things in the corner of my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Is that Maruyama-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An old lady who lives nearby. She seems to be in trouble… I should help her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored Kawasaki, who was about to say something and called out to Maruyama-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, I’ll help you out, Maruyama-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, aren’t you Shiraishi-san’s son? Thank you for offering. Then, can you help me bring these back home? It’s around the corner, but carrying these really puts a burden on my old back…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. You can depend on me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maruyama-san smiled as she handed over her shopping bags that she was holding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such a good child. You took care of my grandchildren the other day too, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it was fun with them around, you don’t need to mind that, Maruyama-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a part of volunteer work, I’ve been helping the elderly around the neighborhood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maruyama-san was one of the people I helped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other day, I played with her grandchildren while their parents were away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, did you forget that you’re injured? Give me one of those.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki forcefully took a bag from my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she had a point. My arm was actually hurting a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t really need to help me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not that heartless. I won’t let you do anything on your own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Kawasaki with a ‘hmph’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, you’re walking with a girl at this hour? Is she your girlfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her question with a chuckle. I knew that she was joking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, you’re such a joker, Maruyama-san! Don’t you think so, Kawasaki? …Huh? Kawasaki?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was blushing for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she’d just proceed to go along with the joke and tease me, but not this time, I guess. Maybe, she wasn’t used to this kind of joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m not his girlfriend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki replied with difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before we knew it, we had arrived at Maruyama-san’s place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, you two. I appreciate it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maruyama-san thanked us several times and gave us some tea cakes as a thanks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t expect something in return, but it didn’t feel bad to receive thanks like this sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That meant my efforts in helping weren&#8217;t in vain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you do this kind of thing often, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do it whenever I feel like it. So, are you still thinking that I’m a delinquent?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders as I said that. Kawasaki sighed in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fine, you convinced me. But, you shouldn’t do something like this until your injuries are cured, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Seriously, you need to take care of yourself more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, mommy, I get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kouhai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, not your mommy, you pervert.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my way of telling you that you’re a caring person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, I don’t want you to call me that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her disgusted face made me feel hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were having this exchange, we arrived at my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, see you at school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever Kawasaki and I worked on the same day, we would walk home together like this. Her house was ten minutes away from mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, wait, I’ll walk you home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it for a while, but I really should do that. Hearing my words, Kawasaki frowned at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? What are you saying, suddenly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, because of that sh*tshow, we came back later than usual, right? I don’t think it’s safe for girls like you to walk by yourself at this hour… Well, it isn’t actually that late, but still…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about it, 9pm and 10pm weren’t much different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, after that sh*tshow, I couldn’t help but worry about her mental state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I won’t go through the dark alleys like an idiot. I’ll be fine, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. I know you’re worried about me, but I’m mentally stronger than you think… It’s a tempting offer, though~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Kawasaki teasingly with a seductive smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that, my heart jumped a little. She was younger than me, but that smile was too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not realizing my state of mind, she waved lightly at me and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while after that, I continued watching her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a good </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kouhai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who always understood my intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The darkness of the night continued following her back as she slowly disappeared from my sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it was night, the breeze didn’t feel cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, it felt warm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stood up in silence for a bit, various noises started to enter my ears. The voice of the crickets, the neighbor’s TV and the sound of Kawasaki&#8217;s footsteps that slowly fading in the distance. A stray cat approached me and meowed at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Yet, I felt strangely uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Witch, is that you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind me, there was a crow perched on a branch of a tree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stared at it, it stared back at me without showing any reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a faint sign of mana from its body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until a few minutes ago, it masked its presence by blending with Kawasaki’s, but now that she had gone, I noticed its presence easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know since when you’ve been watching me, but can you please not stalk me with your familiars? That’s a crime, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crow then spread its wings and flew away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…What the hell was that all about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was she stalking me, anyway?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I could ask her about it tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh? Did I fall asleep?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My consciousness slowly rose. I took a look at the clock on my table. It was midnight already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to stand up with my sluggish body and tried to figure out what happened to me before I fell asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It should be around ten when I got back home from my part-time job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laid down in my bed to take a rest for a bit, but I fell asleep instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I planned to study when I got home, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sleeping around that hour felt bad to me. I don’t know why, it just felt that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in any case, I didn’t feel sleepy anymore, I could start studying right now if I wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I should take a bath first, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t turn on the AC, so my body was all sweaty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body still felt sluggish, but I could still move around. I walked toward the door to my room and opened it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt dizzy when I walked. Did I catch the summer cold? No way, right? Anyway, I disregarded that feeling and walked down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom had come back home already. I could hear her peaceful snore coming from her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a yawn and opened the door to the shower room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing that came to my sight was a pair of big breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, my gaze moved down to a pair of slender wet legs. I noticed that there wasn’t a single piece of clothing that covered the body parts of the person in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it simply, this girl in front of me, Kirishima Hina, was naked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Godou?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an instant all my sleepiness went away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina immediately took a towel and hid her chest with it. Her face instantly turned red like a tomato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she muttered in a small voice,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Close it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-The door! Close it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Ah, r-right, s-sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I closed the door behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now I was trapped inside this room with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was panicking, okay? But, I don’t think that was a good enough excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence between us was suffocating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that I f**cked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel cold sweat running through my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was standing there, paralyzed, Hina shouted at me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-W-What the hell are you doing, idiot?! G-Go outside first before closing the door!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry, t-that was my bad! B-But, why are you here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t you wait until later to ask that question?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, of course not! I need to know now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sharpened my concentration to burn this scene into my eyes. (T/N: This is the correct way to use your abilities from your previous life.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, my concentration was at its peak. If I were to give a comparison, it was at the same level as when I fought the witch in earnest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait! For! Later!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina pushed me with her right hand while her left hand was pressing the towel against her chest tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-Fine, I get it! Stop pushing me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door and went outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe because she was also panicking at that time&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She used her left hand to hold on the handle, trying to close the door from her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, the towel that covered her body gently fell onto the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, her body was exposed to my eyes in its full glory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I can’t get married anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina was lying on my bed. Hugging my pillow tightly, she was clearly sulking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Really, that was my bad. Please, forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Why were you staring at me like that, anyway?! Y-You shoulda looked elsewhere! …I should just report you to the police.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t, I beg you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that I was in the wrong here, so I discarded my pride and bowed down to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was pouting while hugging my pillows. Her eyes were red, probably from tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, she was wearing her middle school’s gym uniform. She probably used it as her nightwear nowadays. Once again, I found myself staring at her. She looked sexier than usual in that outfit. Probably because she had just come out of the bath?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, what could I do to fix her mood?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I should change the topic first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you here, anyway? It’s been a while since you visited at all, so I didn’t expect you to be here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Our bath’s heater broke down, so I was going to go to the public bath. I met your mom on the way there and things happened…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, sorry about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could describe her in a single word, my mom was ‘pushy’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finding out that Hina was about to go to the public bath, she most likely forcefully dragged her here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s all okay! Don’t be sorry! When I explained my situation to her, she just told me to borrow your bath instead. It’s to save some money, she said. Anyway, your mom hasn’t changed, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes livened up as she tried to imitate my mom. Her expression clearly brightened after that. I managed to subside her wrath, thankfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, no matter how well they got along with each other, it was still inappropriate of her to leave Hina on her own. Like seriously, how could she fall asleep after dragging someone into the house?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, it really has been a while since I last came here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back when we were younger, she used to come here all the time. We were inseparable back then, like family. As we grew older though, she came here less and we slowly grew apart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You stopped coming here after everyone teased you about it back in middle school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I can’t help it! I-It was embarrassing, okay?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, her house was right next to ours. In fact, her room was right next to mine. I could easily go there if I were to use a ladder as a bridge. Sadly, my parents forbid me from doing it because it was dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aside from your new </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, your room hasn’t changed at all, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She picked up a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the bookshelf then started reading it while laying down in my bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using someone else’s bed as if it was her own… Seriously, this girl…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I was about to complain, a wave of dizziness struck me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Don’t mind me… It’s nothing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head and my consciousness immediately cleared up. Then, I glanced at the clock on my table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, why did you take a bath this late at night?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had dinner with your mom and we talked for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mom was the cause, huh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slumped my shoulders when I heard it. Seeing my reaction, Hina pouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s still your fault that you saw me naked just now, okay? Also, I decided to go in late because I was afraid that you’d wake up and use it. How tired were you anyway? Your mom said that as soon as you got home, you immediately fell asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got a shift tonight, of course I was tired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t try to evade the question.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet scent of her shampoo entered my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I realized that my childhood friend, who I had always thought of as a family, had turned into a fine woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’ve been doing volunteer work lately. You also helped out both the student council and the sports clubs because they are short-staffed. The final exam is around the corner too… Seriously, are you okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard those words, my eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. She knew about everything. I’ve never told anyone about it, but she knew about it anyway. She’s been watching over me, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I’m fine. Thanks for asking, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t force yourself too hard, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not forcing myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t lie to me. How long do you think I’ve known you? You’re feeling unwell, aren’t you? I know you’re trying to hide it from me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared right into my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…As expected, she found out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t seem to have a fever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered as she placed her hand on my forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You might catch it when morning comes. If that happens, take a break from school and your part-time job, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, mom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Kawasaki and her&#8230; I was surrounded by worrywarts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such a handful, you know that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mom said otherwise though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because you’re always trying to do everything by yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina sighed, grabbed me and pushed me onto the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go to sleep. Here’s your blanket.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrapped the blanket around my body, grabbed my shoulders and forced me to lie down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she lied down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll catch a cold like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Don’t get me wrong. I’m just doing this because I can’t trust you if I were to leave you alone. There’s nothing more to it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop that outdated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tsundere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> act.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my retort, she smiled mischievously and continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m just doing this because I’m too lazy to go home!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understandable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well anyway, I should go home now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re going home? I mean, of course, you are… Yes, you should go home quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I mean, if I were to sleep with someone who saw my naked body, who knows what would happen to me, right? Well, just kidding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We used to sleep together when we were little, but we were high school students now, so of course we wouldn’t be doing that. She was right, if we were to do that, who knows what would happen…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’m going home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She got up from the bed while yawning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before she left the room, she turned around and looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rest properly, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it in a serious tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even if she didn’t tell me that, I was planning to do it anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she left my room, my consciousness slowly faded away.</span></p>
