<h3>Afterwords</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time flew by and I realized that it had been more than two and a half years since I last published a book. In any case, I’m happy to be back!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether you’re new or a longtime reader of mine, I’ll introduce myself. My name is Amamiya Kazuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After deciding to make my debut again in the Rookie Award, I managed to receive an honorable mention for the Kodansha Light Novel Bunko Rookie of the Year Award. That’s the story behind this book’s publication.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, what do you think of the modern reincarnation rom-com? Do you like it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? It isn’t the kind of romcom you expected? It’s still a story about youth, so it counts as a romcom!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story started out when I was thinking about what if two powerful beings who were able to decide the fate of the world were to be dragged into a modern romcom setting. At first, I planned for the story to be light-hearted, but as I began to make the hero and the witch’s backstory, it turned into a more serious story than I planned. Though, it became more interesting as well. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, can the former hero and former witch be freed from their curses and live happily ever after?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of their distorted feelings that carried over from their previous lives, it would be hard for them to achieve that, but both of them will never accept the situation where each others’ hard work in their previous life goes unrewarded in their next lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I have a chance to release the next volume, I will bring you a more light-hearted romcom into the series. Because it’s summer when I’m working on this, the theme will be summer related events! Summer festival! Fireworks! Swimming pool! Oh, I’m getting excited by just thinking about it!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you find the idea interesting, make sure to say it on Twitter or any social media you have!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This humble author, who had been egosearching since the first day of this book’s release will definitely be pleased to see your feedback!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, recommend this book to your friends as, if there are more readers, the more the chance that this book will get a second volume.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, time to move on to the appreciation section. Firstly, thank you M-san and S-san who managed to discover this work. Thank you Eeru-san for the lovely illustrations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a huge thank you to everyone who was involved in the creation of this book!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this work managed to touch your heart a little, it would be a huge pleasure for me, the author.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, sorry for the self-plug, but I also won the HJ Novel Award with my other work, ‘Haibara-kun’s Teenage New Game+’. The book will be released in the near future. (T/N: JNC licensed it already btw.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s about a young man who regretted his gloomy youth and traveled back in time to fix it. It’s an interesting story, so please read it if you like it!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that’s about it for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope to see you again in the next volume or another series! </span></p>
