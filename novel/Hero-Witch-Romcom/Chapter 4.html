<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Even If the World Turned into Your Enemy</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monday, a new week began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so did the three-day exam period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During this period, all club activities were suspended as everyone was fully concentrated on the exam. Well, that was what supposed to happen. In reality, thanks to the suspension of club activities, everyone got more time to play around instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh. I didn’t feel so good for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was this indescribable hazy feeling in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji, who was walking beside me, noticed this and asked,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Godou? You failed the exam?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, out of all people, asking me that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, what are you talking about? I’ll pass no problem, of course!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, that’s a surprising answer…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka would be astonished if she were to hear that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged his shoulders before continuing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, other than math, that is. I’m sure that I’ll get red. Hell, it won’t even be close to the passing mark.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel you. In my case, my physics seems to be horrid too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exam subjects for the first day were math, physics and modern japanese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I doubt that I’d get a red mark for any of those subjects even though I barely studied, but it was exactly for that reason that I doubt that I’d get any higher than the average score.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, why were you sighing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji stopped walking and turned to face me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me guess. Is it because of Shiina Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bulls-eye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I wasn’t even sure if I was feeling troubled because of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, maybe I was worried about her a little, but, who knows…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;What are you on about? Of course my body is breaking down. Is it not obvious?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly remembered the witch’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that her body was breaking down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t think that was the cause of this indescribable feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I had no reason to worry about the witch anymore. I was no longer a hero and I had no obligation to care about anyone who wasn’t my friend, not to mention the witch who was my nemesis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, logically speaking, the witch had nothing to do with this indescribable feeling I was having.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was trying to convince myself of that, Shinji muttered,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, in any case, neither Yuuka nor I could do something about her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She seems to be suffering from something. She seems close to killing herself, you know? It’s just my feelings though. I don’t know why she would do that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head went blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not the only one who noticed it, by the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was the reason why Yuuka held that study group in the first place. At first, we thought that she was like that because of some troubles at her previous school, but it seemed like our guess was wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shinji…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know the cause, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he continued his words with a dismissive tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s only so much that strangers like us can do to her, you know? We can’t get her to open up her heart to us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, he stopped saying anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, we had arrived at the parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The roof of the parking lot blocked the sunlight, so the area was relatively cooler but, for some reason, that didn’t stop my sweat from running through my cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… Shiraishi… Kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a familiar voice calling me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see the witch standing there. She probably called me ‘Shiraishi-kun’ because Shinji was with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, today was the day for her treatment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, see you tomorrow then. Don’t slack off and study properly, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, see you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reading the subtle atmosphere between me and the witch, Shinji quickly bid his farewell, rode on his bike and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A warm breeze caressed my cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to see the witch staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence enveloped us. Thanks to the fight we had yesterday, there was an awkward atmosphere between us</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could keep my silence but, if we kept dilly-dallying here, we wouldn’t get any job done for today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let’s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I urged her, she nodded and walked behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, there was something strange about the way she walked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staggering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it wasn’t me who was looking at her, if the person was attentive enough, they would notice it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how I tried to look at her, she looked unwell. It was obvious that she was trying so hard to endure the pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the other day, her condition wasn’t even close to her current state. I wouldn’t be able to tell that she was unwell unless I tried to observe her a little closely. And yet, she became like this overnight. What happened to her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oi, what’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lent her a shoulder, then I realized something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if she didn’t become like this overnight? What if her condition was originally this bad and she had just been hiding it so well that I failed to notice it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would explain it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked me back. She knew what I was talking about, yet she acted like this anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop playing dumb! No matter how–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you care? It has nothing to do with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said that, I couldn’t find any words to rebuke her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we were just cooperating because we had the same goal. It wasn’t like we were friends or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no reason to care about her personal affairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. I had no reason at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, it does have something to do with me. If your condition is caused by the curse, then I have the right to know. It’s concerning your treatment, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After some hesitation, I managed to come up with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I wasn’t even sure if I could convince her with that or not, but I decided to roll with it anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I guess your words make sense. But still, it has nothing to do with the treatment. I told you the other day that my body is breaking down, didn’t I? That’s it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, she didn’t say anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked all the way to her house without saying anything to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t say anything to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the question, ‘is this really okay?’, kept echoing in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Cerys’ PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That person was always like that. He always acted like a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To other people, that person, Grey Handlet, was always a hero and nothing more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kept telling me that he wouldn’t help me yet, here he was, helping me without making any fuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even back then, his decision to not help me was actually his way of helping me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t seem to realize that, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that action became the justification for the church to execute him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That action caused the whole world to judge him as a sinner who aided the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously, what a foolish hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trying to help the enemy of the world was clearly a foolish thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was too immersed in his role and ended up paying the price for it with his life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could say that he deserved it. If only he didn’t force himself to help me, none of this would’ve happened. Besides, I’ve never wanted his help to begin with. That was why, there was no reason for me to mourn his death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reason at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of mourning him, I should condemn him for his foolishness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, I found myself crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even know why I was crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was being chased by the elites of the church and I learned of Grey’s death through them. And I knew that they weren’t lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, they were his comrades, the exorcists created by the ‘Hero Creation Project’. To them, Grey was the person they placed their hopes in, their hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the reason why I knew they weren’t lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I had no reason to care, the revelation made me flustered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they used that chance to give me a mortal wound. I realized that I wouldn’t be able to survive it back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, with my last ounce of strength, I reincarnated both me and the hero to another world.</span></p>

<p><b>I crushed the headless corpse of the hero and turned it into a pool of blood before dying next to it.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though this man was the person who kept annoying me until the very end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until his dying breath, he kept ignoring my wish and did whatever he wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t want this fool to end like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I prayed that he wouldn’t be burdened as a hero anymore in his next life and could live happily until the day he died again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, one of the reasons why I chose to reincarnate in another world was to prevent my curse from going haywire in the other world. But, the main reason why I did it was because I couldn’t let him die like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, when we finally met again, that fool was still acting as if he was a hero. Even in a world that didn’t need a hero’s existence, he still tried his hardest to reach out to those people in need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when he couldn’t find anyone to reach out to, he would try his hardest to look for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If this keeps up, you won’t be able to find your own happiness, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was still a foolish man, instead of looking for happiness, he kept making himself unhappy for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I made an oath. This time for sure, I’ll make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I couldn’t live in this world without his help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To cover up that fact, I made an excuse to him. I pressured him to help me because he didn’t kill me back in the other world. Because of his actions, I became like this. Since it was technically the truth, the excuse worked perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I didn’t expect anything more than that from him. The matter of my body breaking down was out of the scope of our cooperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t really have anything to do with the curse. I had expected it to happen since the very beginning because this body was different from my previous one. My previous body had an unnaturally high resistance to curse, meanwhile this body had nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, even though I casted that terrible curse upon the world, I couldn’t feel any pain from the curse’s side effects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This pain was something that I should’ve felt to begin with. It was the punishment I deserved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain I had to endure… I couldn’t even begin to describe it with words. Since I was a child, back when the memories of my previous life hadn’t awakened, I had to deal with this pain. My consciousness was always hazy. I kept getting hospitalized for unknown causes to the point that my parents always worried about me. Living in constant pain, even before I knew what pain was, became my new daily life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I dreamt of my previous life. Gradually, I recalled everything about my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought that those memories were nightmares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who would have thought that I was the ‘main character’ of the dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, as I got older, I was forced to believe it. When the memories of the magic and witchcraft I had learned came back to me, I casted them to my body to ease my pain a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, in the third year of my middle school, I finally remembered everything about my previous life and more importantly, about the hero. So, I used my magic to look for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…At that time, I was impatient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my resistance in the previous life, I underestimated the curse’s strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized that if I stood by doing nothing, the curse would eventually crush my heart. While that itself wasn’t really a big deal because it was what I deserved, the world would have to pay for it if it were to actually happen. That was why I decided to look for him so he could completely get rid of the curse in my soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I moved into his school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to take such a drastic measure because I was close to my limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, by each passing year, the curse started to erode more part of my soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the erosion worsened, the pain became harder to bear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was to the point that it was hard to hide it. Even Grey had noticed my condition at some point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, as long as I could receive his treatment once in a while, it would alleviate the pain a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could rely on it to survive for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I was at my limit, but I didn’t really care if anyone were to find out about my condition. I’d die soon anyway, it didn’t really matter in the end. As long as Grey could live happily in this world, I didn’t care about anything else.</span></p>

<p><b>I was the witch of Calamity, someone who plunged the world to disaster.</b></p>

<p><b>It was a witch’s fate to be unhappy, that was all there to it.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grey was the hero who saved the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was his fate to be happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For someone who worked the hardest to save the world to go unrewarded, I couldn’t let that happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I’d definitely make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the hero role made him unhappy, then I’d free him of that role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swore to make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why.</span></p>

<p><b>I couldn’t let him help me.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered those words involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it allowed for me to complain when I was alone like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even now, the pain tormented my soul. It was hard for me to get up from my bed. Luckily, this was my own room and no one else was there. I didn’t need to pretend. I could lay down all day if I wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s painful…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered his face when I scolded him harshly the other day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I had no right whatsoever to scold him like that. He could just shove me away and slap me in the face if he wanted to and I wouldn’t complain. But, he listened to me properly. Even though no one would blame him if he were to ignore me, he listened to my story anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone else in the previous world called my story nonsense. I could understand that, as it was the right thing to do. I didn’t want anyone’s sympathy anyway. To me, words were just another form of weapon to take my opponents down, there wasn’t anything more to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, thanks to that man, I discovered the joy of talking to other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was the only person who would listen to me earnestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s sad…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this world, he was the only one who knew about my identity as the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why there were people who’d come forward and talk to me. That made me happy. But, at the same time, it made me feel guilty. After all, I was someone who plunged the world into a disaster. I had no right to talk to those kind people. I wasn’t a being who should be alive to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized that I was afraid of being hated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if they were to find out about my true identity?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a being who should be hated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that I deserved it, living in this kind of pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was someone who should be hated, the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t ask for help, even if I desperately wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the second day of the exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did better on today’s exam compared to yesterday’s. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current time was 1pm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the exam, we only had to attend school for three hours. I was currently on my way home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, no, I was supposed to be on my way home, but for some reason, I was inside a shopping mall near the school area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before you assume things, no, I didn’t come here out of my own volition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you have to study?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Hina, who was walking in front of me, that question. Hearing it, she turned around to face me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She placed her hands behind her backs as she smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll study properly when I get home~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, what are we here for then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch, of course. Studying is important, but taking a break is also important. Since school finishes early, we gotta make the most of the time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then scurried around the streets filled with restaurants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You brought me here just for that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What’s that? You got a problem with that? It feels lonely going here alone, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She averted her gaze slightly as she pouted. Her cheeks reddened a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re too lax, you’ll end up like Shinji, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shinji who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, that’s just cruel…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, why are you worried about me? I got way better grades than you. Worry about yourself instead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, yeah, but… Honestly, I don’t think I’ll get any red marks even if I were to slack off a little.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See?~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was in an unnaturally good mood, I wonder why?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she do well in the exam or something?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Omurice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, what did I expect from you, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is a western-styled restaurant there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t wanna go there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why did you ask me what I wanted to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I know what I should make for you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? I’ll look forward to it, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, go ahead, but can you back off a little? People will think that we’re a couple.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina in a whisper before she turned her head away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the problem with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that question, Hina’s face reddened as she stopped dead in her tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You really don’t care much about what other people think of you, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I used to be a hero back in my previous life. People assumed a lot of things about me back then, so I was pretty much used to it by now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hina?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina let out a cough. She then scolded me for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should pay more attention to how people think about you. That’s why you’ve never noticed what me or other people are thinking about you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess what she was trying to tell me was correct. I was executed by the church because I didn’t notice what they were thinking about me back then. Though, I had no regrets about that since I did my job as a hero properly before I died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking of this, I followed Hina to enter a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat by her side in front of the counter and ordered a large-sized </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tonkotsu</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. They only sold </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tonkotsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> here and Hina knew it too as we used to come here often back when we were younger as the price here was cheap for students like us and the food was tasty. I didn’t come as often nowadays, though. Mostly because I had been busy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We slurped our </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> without a care in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with sweats trickling down from our foreheads, we enjoyed this momentary blissful feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew~ I’m full.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered as I pat my stomach. I noticed that Hina was staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes looked serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook the glass in her hand as she asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s bothering you these days?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You noticed?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I did. Who do you think I am? I’m your childhood friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She snorted and crossed her arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her boastful attitude looked adorable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, I couldn’t beat this girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably knew about me more than I did myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, it should be okay to ask her this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s something that I don’t understand…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She listened to me in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There’s this one person that I hate. My enemy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes widened as I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, that’s rare. I thought you liked everyone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That person is a special case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, it felt strange even to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate that person. I don’t want to get involved with them. Like I said, we’re enemies, we don’t get along well. We sometimes work together but, even during that, we’ll curse each other as we go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was how our relationship went.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Toward someone like that, there should be no reason to sympathize with them, right? As long as they didn’t ask me, I shouldn’t care about them, right? I mean, there’s no reason for me to help them…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why am I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was staring at my own hand, Hina asked me a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you want to help that person…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you don’t know if that feeling is coming from your heart or not, am I correct?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had been struggling with this. I didn’t know where this feeling came from. Was it from my obsession? Or was it my true feelings?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina held her forehead with her hand and sighed in exasperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re an idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t expect her to suddenly insult me like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up at her in surprise, she was frowning while rubbing her brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You looked so down these days, I wondered what was wrong with you… Turns out it’s just this dumb thing… Then again, what did I expect from you? …Jeez, seriously, what an idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hina? You know, I’m actually struggling here–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen here, idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop calling me an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut it and listen. Your assumption is wrong in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your hatred. What enemies? If you really hate that person, you wouldn’t be worrying about them like this. You think that you hate them, but in truth, you don’t. That’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You care about that person. Maybe you even like that person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to deny her words immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But no words managed to come out of my mouth. Maybe, somewhere in my heart, I was aware of that already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want to help them because you like them. Since you like them, when you notice that they’re in trouble, you want to help them. It’s simple, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My memories together with the witch flashed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were barely any good memories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the time, we were just fighting or cursing each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, we were enemies. Because that was the case, I refused to help her and she stated clearly that she hated me and cursed at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on the knowledge that I had learned, I always assumed that I hated her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was impossible not to hate your enemy, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that way of thinking was the correct one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, I had never really learned about how relationships worked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about the time I had with the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never felt bad around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never felt uncomfortable around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our silly banters, stupid quarrels… Those times when we did it, felt really fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I didn’t realize that feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the witch was the first person I had a real relationship with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t hate that person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only when Hina put it into words for me that I could come to terms with my feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I don’t know who that person is… But you actually like that person. You just didn’t realize it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like my common sense was overturned</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What we were talking about felt so obvious that it was embarrassing that I felt troubled by it in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you want to help someone so much even though they refuse your help, that means you like that person and you don’t want to lose them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina in a gentle tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the same as me, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though you don’t want my help, I’m here to help you anyway. You’re someone I care about. We’ve been friends since we were kids. I’m always worrying about you every day, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Friends, huh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Friend, a relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Connection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A word that symbolized mutual support.</span></p>

<p><b>What was it that made me reluctant to befriend the witch?</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words came out of my mouth involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked out the window. The sky was clear.</span></p>

<p><b>I knew what I should do now.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, Hina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was racking my brain for an excuse to tell her, Hina waved her hand dismissively and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just get going. That person is waiting for you, aren’t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really could see through me, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or maybe I was just too easy to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed the money for the ramen on the table and dashed toward the exit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go get &#8217;em, tiger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got on my bike and pedaled it to the witch’s house. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I didn’t really need to do it now, but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to save her as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><b>After all, I found the reason I had been looking for.</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a simple thing, it was unthinkable that I had been ignoring it for so long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina was right, I was an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sweat poured down on my face like a raging wave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The summer heat was slowly taking my energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I had no intention of slowing down my bike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no reason to hesitate anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I’ll definitely save her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was trying to catch my breath in front of the witch’s apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I coulda just took it slowly and went here normally instead of pedaling my bike like a madman, but oh well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I needed to talk with the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed the intercom in front of the apartment. But, only silence greeted me for quite a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just right before the security guard was about to kick me out, the witch finally answered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{What do you want?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need to talk.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I don’t want to talk with you.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care. Just come out and listen to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My voice sounded more forceful than I thought. The witch was surprised to hear it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;That’s unusual. It’s the first time I’ve ever heard you sounding so forceful.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You won’t listen to me otherwise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, I heard her let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Hero, you…}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop calling me that. I’m not a hero anymore. You said it yourself, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;So you’ve come to admit that already?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. It’s about time for me to grow up. I can’t be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> forever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a short period of silence after I said that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;Whatever, come in.}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She granted me permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went up to the floor where the witch was living in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, I managed to catch my breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, I didn’t have enough time to organize my thoughts, so I still didn’t know what I should say to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew what I wanted to talk about, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should be able to work out something from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door to her room was opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went in and took off my shoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room hasn&#8217;t changed since the last time I came here. The bookshelves were still occupying every corner of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of old paper tickled my nostrils.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yo.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch was sitting cross-legged on the sofa at the back of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she was sipping her tea, she turned her gaze to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you— W-Wait, are you okay?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her composed gaze turned into a gaze filled with anxiety after she saw me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Are you worried about me? How kind of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened? Why are you sweating so much? Your face looks pale too…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, this is nothing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wobbled a little mid-sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait, there’s no way you’re okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m okay. I just forced myself a little when I pedaled my bike to get here. Had to turn off my limiter and all that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way you’d be okay after that then!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, if it comes to it, I’ll just vomit here. That’ll make me feel a whole lot better”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you even dare to think about it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmed the fidgety witch down and sat down on the sofa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… My head hurts…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you get a heat stroke? What is the temperature outside?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably thirty eight or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who knows, who cares. It was hard to think with this kind of headache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why were you even?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch picked up the AC remote and turned down the room’s temperature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, I’ll get you something to drink. Maybe I still have a sports drink or something in the fridge…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it, she was a kind girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always pretended to be cold and detached, but whenever she panicked like this, her true personality came out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, witch…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now you can no longer escape! HAHAHAHAHA!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-EH?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laughed with all my heart. It seemed like she took my joke seriously as she took a step back from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, that was the wrong character to play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re creepy, you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, that’s just mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, what is wrong with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch as she handed me a bottle of sports drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I’m more of an Aquari guy than a Pucari guy though.” (T/N: Aquarius and Pocari, two big brands of sports drinks in Japan.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cut me off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just drink it already, you’ll get dehydrated otherwise…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I obeyed her words and gulped down the Pucari. Ahh, that hits the spot…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, the headache finally went away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my gaze to the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s how you normally dressed at home, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You got a problem with it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. Her style was rough, but it was a staple for summer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could describe how she looked currently, it would be…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look cute. The gap between how you look right now and your normal self actually makes me excited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoops, I didn’t mean to say that out loud. I guess my mind was still hazy as I normally would never say something like that. I could feel my face starting to heat up. Yikes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wha?! What is it, all of a sudden?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face turned bright red as she shouted at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Never mind that, it isn’t important. There’s something I want to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still flustered, the witch asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her closely. What should I tell her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started to scour through my memories with her. The days when we spent our lives together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cerys… You’re a pain in the ass, do you know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing that came out of my mouth was an insult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing that, the witch furrowed her brows and almost immediately, sent out a complaint to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you ever tried to look in the mirror?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that I’m the same, though I hate to admit it. Still, you’re way worse than me, do you know that? I know you’re THE witch and all, but you’re still too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No?! What are you even talking about?! You’re even worse than me! You’ve never listened to anything that anyone said! Always neglecting yourself and running toward a problem recklessly like a headless chicken! You’re way worse than me! Worse!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look in the mirror! So were you! I’m the only one who knows of your true nature! Self neglect is literally your middle name! Also, why are you so afraid of other people? No one in this world knows that you’re the witch. No one will hate you unconditionally. So, stop struggling in the dark by yourself! Ask for help, seek for help! Everyone will help you if you were to ask them! Just lean on someone when you’re in trouble, it isn’t that hard!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what?! I’m still THE witch, my sin won’t go away even if no one knows who I am! In fact, just by existing, I’m already putting the world in danger! You already know that, don’t you?! I shouldn’t be alive in the first place! How could someone like me have the right to depend on other people? I’m a monster who should be hated! I deserve to be burned in hell! I don’t deserve to be saved! So, stop worrying about me and worry more about yourself instead!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t f**k with me! There’s no way that’s true! Someone as kind as you don’t deserve to be hated, let alone be burned in hell! I’ll make sure of that! I’ll save you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch held her breath for a moment before showing me an exhausted smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still trapped by the curse, aren’t you? That’s why you’re acting like this. You lied to me earlier when you admitted that you aren’t a hero anymore, right? Well, I expected it, there’s no way that problem of yours could be solved so easily. Haah… I was a fool to believe you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, the curse doesn’t affect me anymore. Hina had told me enough that I’m just a normal high school boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why?!…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why are you trying to save me?! You are not a hero anymore! You have no reason to save me! We’re enemies! I was the reason why you lived like that back in the previous world! I was the reason why you were killed! Hate me! Hold a grudge against me! That’s the feelings you should have about me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re seriously a major pain in the ass…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up and stared at her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Am I wrong? I am THE witch! I’m the most troublesome, evil, disgusting, the worst person you can ever meet in this world! That’s a given!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re really like that, Hina and the others would never go out of their way to help you. They cared about you because they noticed your kindness. You’re a kind girl, nothing you said would ever change that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! Shut up! You won’t fool me with lousy lies like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch tried to catch her breath after that outburst. There were tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Surely you didn’t come here to talk about this kind of thing? Just hurry up and cut the case already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped forward and closed my distance to the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wha?! D-Don’t come any closer!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She summoned her staff and held it against my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I ignored her and took another step forward instead. She panicked and moved her staff away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a few steps backwards as I continued forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, her back hit the wall. I immediately slammed my hand against that wall and leaned closer to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed her a daring smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See what I meant? Even right now, you’re showing me your kindness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, what do you want?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cerys… No, I should stop calling you that. Shiina Mai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I changed my way of addressing her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina looked surprised as her staff shook a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the curse from her previous life was still bounding her, then I would be the person who would free her from it. I found the whole situation funny. She said all those things about me being cursed when it was her who was suffering from a curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mean it literally, of course. Yes, her soul was bound by that heinous curse, but that wasn’t what I was meant to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina was afraid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afraid of being approached by people, afraid of being touched by people. She was like this back then too and she hadn’t gotten any better since then. Even when we were linking our arms together for her treatment, her fear showed clearly in her manners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it came to communicating with others, she tended to take a step back before even doing anything. It was because she was afraid of getting hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for that was because she always thought that she deserved to be hated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, for all her life, she had been living in a hell filled with nothing but people who were hostile to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To save this idiot who was holding her tears back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said this without any hesitation,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be my friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face felt hot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it started to redden as we were speaking. Did she notice that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina looked at me with her mouth slightly opened. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after, her face turned bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You?! W-Why suddenly?!—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out those words while panicking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that was a natural response, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she were to say the same thing to me, I would react the same way as her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I should explain myself clearly to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Want to help you. I want to see you smile… You’re right, this isn’t how I should feel toward the enemy from my previous life, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was red up to her ears as she heard more of my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why couldn’t she have a more serious reaction? It was hard trying to come up with those words, you know? In any case, I continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being enemies and such… Let’s bury that relationship in the past already. Be my friend. If we became friends, then, I don’t need to think of a reason to help you. Because that’s what friends are for, right? To help each other when needed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe, I was mistaken about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normal friends wouldn’t have a tighter bond than we currently have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feelings I had about her were way heavier than the feelings I had towards any of my friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, nothing would change if I didn’t change the nature of our relationship. It was indeed a troublesome one, I admit that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Becoming friends? …To help me?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina gripped the hem of her clothes. There was a sense of longing in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the end, you haven’t changed at all, huh?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many times should I tell you so you can understand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to remove the curse that had been eating this girl’s heart for years, I had no choice but to repeat those embarrassing words over and over again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in a way, to remove that curse was a part of my duty. Not as a hero, but as an exorcist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not helping you because I’m a hero or anything like that. I have no obligation to do so because I’m not a hero to begin with. You were correct. For the longest time, I had been tied by my past as a hero. Only when I decided to let it go did I realize that there are a lot of things I wanted to do in this world. And the first thing I want to do is to help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally realized that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally realized that feeling of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That shows you how much I like you! I love you! I love your clumsiness! I love your foolishness! I love everything about you! Everything! You are important to me! To me, you’re the one I cared about the most! I would do anything for you! That’s why, be my friend!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my desperation…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I uttered those ridiculous lines before turning my face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have the courage to look at her face now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, what do you think? Do you believe me now? I’m not trying to help you because of my duty or anything like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence enveloped the room after I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, Shiina opened her mouth to speak,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lies. There’s no way that anyone in this world could like me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, even if everyone in the world hates you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words flowed out naturally out of my mouth. It was how I truly felt about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll still be by your side. I’ll be the only one who loves you in this world. That’s why, I’ll remove both curses out of your heart and soul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m the witch, you know? Even if you could save me, I shouldn’t be saved in the first place! I don’t deserve it! A witch like me has no right to be happy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was just speaking in circles now and her eyes looked more clouded than before. It started to irritate me. So, I shouted at her to shut her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut the hell up! What witch? Who has no right to be happy? That’s all in the past, you dumbass!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She flinched when she heard me shouting. Thanks to that, her eyes began to regain their clarity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In any case, you are not allowed to be unhappy. I won’t let you be unhappy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Huh?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be happy instead. I’ll make you happy, I promise you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled her closer to me and embraced her small, frail looking body in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen, you’re not a sinner anymore. You’re a new person, you didn’t carry your sin from your previous life over. Everyone who knows you in this life likes you. Hell, even I, who knows you from your previous life, like you. You’re liked by everyone. You are not alone anymore. Even the people in our previous world would like you if they knew the truth about you. You’re a victim, not a villain. So, stop trying to take all the blame. Who do you think you are? You’re just a normal girl!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed her face against my chest so she wouldn’t be able to say anything to reject my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A soft, sweet scent tickled my nostrils, reminding me of the fact that the girl in front of me was a girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that didn’t matter in the current situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll save you! I’ll make you happy! So, be my friend and let yourself be saved by me! I’m the hero who has saved the other world, you know? I’m more than reliable enough to save you. So, rely on me. Don’t keep everything to yourself. Talk to me if you need help. That’s what friends are for, at least that’s what Hina told me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to tell her everything that I wanted to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how embarrassing it sounded.</span></p>

<p><b>“Also, if you were to be my friend… I can be your exclusive hero.”</b></p>

<p><b>“Also, if you were to be my friend… I can be your exclusive hero.”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina flinched after she heard those words. When she relaxed her body a little, she,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such an idiot…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smiled at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t believe you said all that just for my sake…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears trickled down from her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One after another, water droplets fell down from her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously… Why even?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a sigh. It seemed like she had finally decided to yield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I released her from my embrace and her body slid down the wall she was leaning on. She sat down on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that you’ve resigned yourself to your fate, I will never let you go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I give up. I can’t beat a stalker like you anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who did you call a stalker, you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">menhera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?! I-I’m not a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">menhera</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">! I’m a mentally stable person, thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reflect on what you’ve been doing and say those words again. This time, slowly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders as a response to her glare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried to be intimidating but the tears in her eyes made her look pitiful instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you sure you want me as a friend? Am I not a major pain in the ass for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are. I know what I’m getting into though, so you don’t need to worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we’re going to be friends then we’ll be friends forever, is that what you want?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded, she giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then. There’s no reason for me to nag you anymore, let’s be friends. I’ll grind you hard, so be prepared, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think that’s how friends work…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you were the one who offered yourself with such vigor just now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had to do it because otherwise a certain thick-headed woman wouldn’t even bother to listen to my words.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Pot calling kettle black.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least I’m better than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, fine, I admit that I’m the most troublesome person in this room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pouted before reaching out her hands toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My legs are weak, help me stand up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, we’re friends aren’t we? Won’t you help me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled her hands and helped her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wobbled before falling into my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shoulder, please…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is your body hurting again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My body is always hurting… Today just feels… Worse than usual…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You shoulda told me beforehand!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held her waist and lifted her. I think this was the so-called legendary princess carry?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Grey?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t call me that. I’m Shiraishi Godou now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Godou… Put me down…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. It’s faster this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Never mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, seriously, you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinna had a strange expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I decided to carry her to her bedroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found the door to the room when I looked around the spacious living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that your room?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Yeah… Why are you asking? …No, wait, can’t we just do it on the sofa instead?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be more comfortable on the bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, am I not… Heavy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?! I’m not that heavy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, stop hitting me! Ouch, my neck!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, that was dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door to her bedroom while moving my aching neck around. Inside, there was a fancily decorated large bed. It was surrounded by a horde of plushies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a look at the witch’s face and her bed alternatively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t just dismiss it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She retorted as she blushed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I won’t judge you. Everyone has their own hobbies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Just kill me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I laid her down on her bed, she immediately crawled under her blanket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she took a nearby plushy and hugged it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on the bed. Her back was pressed against my waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was enveloped in silence for a little while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said you were going to save me… How exactly?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked in almost a whisper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There isn’t an easy way to get rid of the curse, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s you after all. You&#8217;re probably going to say something like ‘I’ll think of something later’&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I had been looking for a solution for quite some time now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But not a single one came to my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, even Shiina didn’t manage to find it even though she was a genius in the field of magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The best thing I could do was to ease her burden.</span></p>

<p><b>“Your curse… I’ll take half of it.”</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked horrified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do that, your life will be in danger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I don’t think so. I’m an exorcist, remember? We have a stronger resistance to curse compared to normal people. As long as I use my exorcism, I should be able to prevent the curse’s erosion on my soul. Honestly, it’s easier to just transfer your curse as a whole to me. I could dispel it little by little if that was the case, but you won’t allow that, will you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! If you do that, who knows what kind of burden will you—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I’ll settle for half. If it’s just half of it, I should be able to do something about it. My curse resistance is higher than you anyway, so it should be fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t planning on sacrificing myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came up with this plan based on my experience on handling my exorcism. If I were to use my exorcism all the time while taking on the curse, the curse shouldn’t be able to harm me. If I wanted to save her, this should be the way to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she understood my intentions. Shiina’s eyes started to waver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t try to handle everything by yourself, Shiina Mai. We’re friends, aren’t we? We should share both our happiness and pain. That’s what friends are for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She went silent for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held my hand to her and she took it timidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Even so, it’s a give-and-take relationship, right? You can’t just expect your friends to help you all the time without giving them something back…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. So, I’ll be looking forward to your help whenever I get into trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that even possible in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course. I’m not as clumsy as you are, but there are some troubles that even I can’t handle alone. I’ll come to you whenever I come across them in the future.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, there was silence after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the voice of the cicadas from outside the building could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stared at each other&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s so, then…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina then uttered words filled with determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please save me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grinned when I heard those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl who was hated by the whole world…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl who was trapped in constant self-blame…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl who always convinced herself that she had no right to be saved…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Had finally asked me, her first friend, for help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, don’t complain after this, okay? Here goes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed my lips against hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmph?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was surprised, but she didn’t resist me. She probably found out that this was part of the procedure to transfer her curse to me. To build a bridge to her soul, we needed to be in physical contact. For treatment, holding hands was sufficient, but for transferring curses, we needed something more than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I didn’t really want to do it like this, but if I wanted to do it quickly, then, this was the way to do it. Actually, I should speed up the process even more. I put my tongue inside her mouth. In the process, our teeth bumped and it hurted me a little. To be fair, this was my first kiss, so I didn’t really know the details on how to do it, so I wish that she could forgive me about that accident later. I raised my concentration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way to transfer her curse over to me was for her to guide me to her soul with her magic. Then, I’d sever the connection between her soul and the curse. After that, she could push the curse over to my soul using her mana. The kiss was to maintain the connection during that process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My only problem with this method was that I had to keep kissing her the entire time. It was a bit awkward, but whatever, just think of it as CPR or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I did this to help her, so I wish she could forgive me for stealing her lips like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Phew…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When everything was finished, I let her lips go. Shiina looked a little dazed. The work required concentration, so it was no wonder that she was exhausted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You okay, Shiina?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, she became startled. Her body started to tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face started to redden up to her ears. She looked like an apple, but I probably was in the same state as her. My face felt hot, as if it was on fire. It was the first time that I had done this, so this should be normal, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was my first kiss…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me a resentful look. Hey, it was my first kiss too!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who cares about that right now. How do you feel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was lighter than usual. She no longer looked like she was struggling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t just dismiss it! …Well, it’s certainly better than before… What about you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she asked me back, I placed my hand on my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a heavy feeling coming from deep inside my chest. However, thanks to my exorcism, I didn’t feel any pain coming from it. My body felt slightly more sluggish than usual, but I should be fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hm, yeah, I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I think I can take more of your curse if you want me to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face reddened again as she turned her gaze away and clenched her fists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t want to kiss you again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, as long as we make physical contact, it’s all good. It doesn’t need to be a kiss.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh crap, I shouldn’t have said that. Her face instantly turned uglier as it started to redden even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Y-Y-You?! Are you kidding me?! I’m going to kill you for real now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait, let me explain myself first!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to explain myself, but her hand landed on my face first. What an impatient girl.</span></p>
