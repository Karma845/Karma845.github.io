<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; End of First Love</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>1</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Summer vacation was over and the second semester had begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the classroom, my eyes met with Shiina’s, who was already seated on her seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her, but she bowed her head and avoided my gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After replying to my greetings, she turned her focus back to the novel in her hands. It seemed like she didn’t want to talk with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since the fireworks festival, she had been acting like this toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been avoiding making any contact with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We still did the treatment for her curse but, even then, we only talked when we needed to. It felt like I was a doctor doing my own job instead of helping a friend out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to do something about it, but I just got dumped by her, so I didn’t want to be too forceful to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hopefully, we could get back to how we were before all this. For now, I should let time heal everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say that love ruins friendships. This was the first time that I’ve ever experienced it, even though I’ve read about this all the time in stories. Honestly, I regretted it. I should’ve just let things go as they were instead of trying to push our relationship forward like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I let my cheek propped onto my desk, I felt a slap on my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning! Why do you look so down?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina seemed to be in a good mood today. I would have liked that she held her slap a little though, because it hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sleepy. My internal clock is all messed up because of the summer vacation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected of a member of the going-home club. You had a good life during the vacation, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes, but I was working part-time, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to Hina’s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Shiina dumped me, I had many sleepless nights and I slowly became a night-owl. Well, part of it was because my shifts were mostly during the evening or night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, I ended up not getting enough sleep. Now that school is starting, it’d be a pain to get my internal clock in order again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I woke up at six everyday during the vacation, why can’t you just do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a freak like you who’d willingly go to club activities. Besides, it’s summer vacation, you’re supposed to be relaxing at home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing my answer, she acted as if she had found out the truth of the world. Stop it, Hina. If you were to proceed, you’d end up like me and join the going-home club!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina, long time no see!~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Misuzu! Heya!~ Look at you, girl! You got a tan?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I went to the beach! Right, hear me out, when I went there with my boyfriend—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a girl classmate approached Hina. Hina then turned her back on me and started chatting with that girl instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared at her slender back. Huh, did she get taller?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like it had been a long time since I last saw her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I think about it, I haven’t seen her that much during the vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I was busy doing my part-time job to cope with my broken heart and she was also busy with her club activities. But, the thing was, normally she’d visit my home to hang out with me when things weren’t so busy. She hadn’t done so lately and it felt lonely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last time she visited me was when she dragged me to go shopping for her swimsuit and that was quite a while ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was sitting idly while thinking in my seat,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, what’s up?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, everyone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji and Yuuka entered the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They walked so close to each other. I guess Shinji accepted her confession back at the festival, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shinji sat in his seat, right in front of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka on the other hand, joined in to chat with the other girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I caught her stealing a glance in my direction, no, in Shinji’s direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the girls noticed her blushing, everyone started to tease her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji then gave the girls thumbs up much to Yuuka’s dismay and the girls teased her even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congrats.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Shinji let out an unusually innocent smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S-So dazzling… Is this what they call happiness? I can’t…</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">For someone with a broken heart like me, this is too much to handle…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His question made me tear up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, you got dumped?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He lifted his brows in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could you ask it so casually? I’m suffering here…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji looked at me before looking at Shiina, who was reading a novel on her own. Then, he patted my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay strong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we were having this exchange, the homeroom teacher entered the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take your seats, we’re starting the homeroom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the boring school day began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I missed the summer vacation already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the vacation, I wanted school to start earlier but now that I had lost the reason why I wanted to go to school, I wished that I could stay in my house instead. I couldn’t even bring myself to talk to Shiina now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, just seeing her already made me happy, but that wasn’t enough!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know everyone is still in the mood for summer vacation, but get a grip already. It’s a little early to talk about this, but the inter-class ball tournament is coming up soon. Please decide the participants later, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ball tournament… Right, there was that thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last year I just skipped the whole thing together with Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…If I participate, could I show Shiina my cool side?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No. Even if I tried, she dumped me already. There was no hope for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t feel like doing it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no use in being depressed forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Summer vacation was already over, so it was time for me to straighten my mood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve decided to give up on Shiina anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I tried to cling to these futile feelings, it’d only backfire on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, I should fix our broken relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I marched toward her seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve given up on Godou. I’ve given up on Godou.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeated those words like chanting a sutra as I pretended to be reading the novel in my hands. I was aware that I hadn’t moved on from the same page for a while now. With an iron will, I restrained my head movements that’d involuntarily look toward Godou’s direction if I were to let my guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was optimistic that this feeling would fade away as long as I didn’t meet him for a while. But he still needed to give me treatment for my curse, so I ended up having to meet him a few times during the summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A part of me felt glad because of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other part of me was disappointed with myself for thinking like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are just friends… We are just friends… We are just friends…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was repeating those words in a whisper,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou’s voice entered my ears. I jumped in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah! What’s wrong with you?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, startled by my voice, Godou also jumped in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so flustered that I threw the novel in my hand away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurried to catch it before it reached the floor, but because of the sudden movement, my body swayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I fell down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Or so I thought. Godou caught me in one of his arms while his other arm was grabbing the novel I had just thrown. That was an amazing catch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That was dangerous…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected of Godou…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear the uproar that my classmates made from a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Kirishima-san and the others came over to check on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan, are you okay?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt embarrassed from all the attention everyone gave me, so I left Godou’s arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a shame that I had to leave his side and it seemed like he shared the same feeling as me, judging from his expression. Wait, there was no way that was the case. It was probably just my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry, I was surprised…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously. What the hell is wrong with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou immediately scolded me. I knew it, that feeling from before was merely my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It was your fault for coming up to me suddenly like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> fault for being surprised by something like that. Besides, you should thank me for saving you. If it was any other person, they wouldn’t be able to catch you gracefully like I did.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pouted my lips in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He made a good argument that I couldn’t refute and I hated it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I realized it, I was speaking normally with him. Even though I have been struggling to do it for a while now. Maybe it was because my emotions ran amok.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As always, Godou’s reflex is amazing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka. Meanwhile, Shinji whistled in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So cool…”, said one of the girls in class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could hear it, that meant Godou could hear it too. But for some reason, he ignored it with a cool face… Ugh, how frustrating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Shiina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Nothing. Don’t mind me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered in a grumpy tone. “I see,” he answered with a happy smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because of that smile that I kept misunderstanding his intention. Seriously, could he just stop?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was cool~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Kirishima-san nudged him with her shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m already cool to begin with, you know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, look at yourself in the mirror properly and say it again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a joke! Stop making fun of me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They looked happy when having such exchanges.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today too, they got along well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Godou and Kirishima-san were my friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as they could smile happily like that, there was nothing else that I could ask for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Godou’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two days have passed since the summer vacation ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My internal clock was corrected and my body finally was getting used to the change of pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pass pass!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A member of the soccer club, Sakuragi, asked for a pass, so I passed the ball in my feet over to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice, Godou!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He received the ball properly and shot it right into the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he came toward me and we high-fived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice shot!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your pass was a nice one too! You should just join the soccer club already, dude. You’ll be a regular in no time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I wanna live like a slouch for a while longer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, well, I got you, I wouldn’t want to throw a life like that away either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sakuragi nodded his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of the upcoming ball tournament, our P.E. class turned into practice sessions for various ball games.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The game I will be participating in is soccer. When they assigned which person got which game, I was asleep, so they decided it without telling me about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I had no complaints about that. I liked all the ball games, so I could go with anything they threw at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I did think that it was a little early to hold a ball tournament. I mean, summer vacation just ended and all. It was still better than regular classes, but you know…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only played soccer in P.E., but thanks to the experience from my previous life, I gained the habit of observing people’s movements and the mindset to anticipate and counter them. My reflex was good to begin with, so applying this strength of mine to the sport would be a piece of cake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that, I could also imitate the movements of a really good player perfectly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, no one could beat me in sports if I was serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pass, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I’d try to hold back, but since the ball tournament was coming up soon, I decided to take it a little more seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I received a pass from Sakuragi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, two of the enemy’s defenders were closing on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As both of them tried to reach for the ball at my feet, I stopped the ball and spun around. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Roulette, that was what the move called. I easily dodged them both, kicked the ball lightly to the right of the defender who tried to stop me in a hurry and dribbled away from him. (T/N: Dude just pulled a Zidane.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went in from the right wing and passed the ball to Shinji who was waiting for me at the center of the penalty box.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, Shinji blew the shot and it hit the side of the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I managed to read the trajectory of the ball ahead of time, so I was already running toward the ball’s landing area. Then, I leaped toward the ball and shot it with my right foot, scoring a goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takahashi, the goalkeeper, didn’t manage to move an inch to stop me. He immediately slumped on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Whoops, I went too far. Guess I needed to hold back a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I felt conflicted like that, I could hear the girls’ yelling voices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently a group of girls just neglected to practice their own sports to watch me play soccer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazing! You’re great!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou, you’re on a roll!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sports were the only field where I could use the experience from my previous life, so it was inevitable that I was good, no, peerless at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, everyone in class didn’t know this fact, so they praised me instead of chiding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I was on a roll, I felt a wave of excitement and was about to show off even more. Then, I saw Shiina making a disgusted look at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could she cut me some slack? I wanted to show off once in a while too!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite my conflicted feelings, the game continued on as everyone kept passing the ball to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that made sense since our team was mostly dependent on Sakuragi, the member of the soccer club and me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I avoided doing flashy moves since Shiina’s gaze hurt my conscience, so I only gave my teammates passes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt confident in my plays, but I also felt confident in my vision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve dealt with hundreds of demons at once before and I could tell the positions of my team and opponent from their footsteps, that was why I could give my teammates passes without even looking toward their positions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I haven’t moved this body around this much for a while, I was having more fun than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pat Sayama’s shoulder after he received my pass and scored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Supporting others felt good too. Before I knew it, I was getting too absorbed in my role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced over at Shiina’s and the rest of the girls’ direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Shiina was staring at me in a daze. Our eyes met involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost immediately, she turned her face away from me. Did she realize that there was nothing but a single tree in that direction?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the other girls were waving at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I waved back, they started screaming. Could it be… Was this the start of my popular phase?!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, actually, this always happened during P.E.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before my memories were awakened, I was already an athletic person. After my memories awakened, I could utilize my combat experience freely. That was why I usually kept everything moderate and restrained myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it was obvious what would happen if I were to take things seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I was holding back, but Sakuragi and the others were trembling when they saw me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you actually a genius?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I’m just on a roll today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how long will that excuse work?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, I wasn’t an amateur and with a little practice, I’d easily get better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the reason why I didn’t join any sports club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in middle school, I was in the basketball club. They invited me to join the club in high school too, but I decided not to join it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my previous life memories, I grew too strong. I knew that if I wanted to be successful easily, I could just do sports all my life, but I didn’t want that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I wasn’t averse to using this strength of mine for something fun like the upcoming ball tournament.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school. A cool breeze caressed my face, a sign of the approaching autumn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my way home, I went to a certain luxurious apartment. Shiina’s house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Good evening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was the scheduled day for her curse’s treatment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina appeared at the doorway. She bowed with a nervous expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was treating me like a stranger again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought our exchange earlier this morning had fixed our relationship somewhat, but it didn’t seem to be the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll serve you some tea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina before she went to the kitchen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat on the sofa while waiting quietly for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she served the tea, she sat down right next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why she didn’t sit in front of me was because we needed to have physical contact to treat the curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I realized my feelings for Shiina, whenever I was this close to her, my heart would start beating faster. I wonder if the sound of my heartbeat reached her? Anyway, I should take a sip of that tea and calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sipping hot tea inside a room with AC felt nice. It was the same feeling as when you eat an ice cream while half of your body is inside a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kotatsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while, only the sound of me sipping my tea could be heard inside the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she was unable to bear the silence, Shiina turned on the TV.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A program with a laid-back atmosphere started to play. That eased my nerves a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-W-What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for some reason, I was the only one who was calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina replied to me with a high-pitched voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nervousness was contagious, so I hoped that she would calm down a little. Why was she even feeling nervous in the first place, anyway?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, I guess it felt awkward to be in the same room as the person you just dumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we talk normally again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Talk normally?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Don’t you realize? Things between us have been quite awkward… We’re still friends, aren’t we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted us to stay as friends at least. It was pathetic of me, I knew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart started to ache because of my own words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina started to freak out. For some reason, her eyes began to tear up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Why though?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right. W-We’re friends, so let’s talk normally.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone was as if she was trying to talk to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it that hard to talk to me? She seemed to be pushing herself so hard just to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unknowingly, I’ve placed a tremendous burden on her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was understandable. After all, someone who was merely a friend and had a business-like relationship with her suddenly tried to get closer like that. It was no wonder that she’d feel uncomfortable, especially when she didn’t have the same feeling as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been disregarding her feelings all this time, hadn’t I?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting carried away by the atmosphere just because she was my first love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this self-loathing was starting to drive me insane.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Last week, I went to watch a movie with Kirishima-san and the others.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina made eye contact with me for the first time today and started to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come to think of it, you guys invited me too back then, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. You couldn’t make it, though.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped. Mine and Hina’s schedule are conflicted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I still had an interest in that movie, but right now, not even a speck of it remained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After watching the movie, Kirishima-san, Shindou-san and I went to the food court. We had a great day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled as she continued her story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she began to reminisce, her stiff expression started to relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she didn’t say anything about the movie meant that it didn’t leave much impression on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it did, that would be the first thing that she’d have mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We even managed to find out about what was going on between Kudou-san and Shindou-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds fun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was Shinji who went with them, he’d find a way to brush the topic off. But, since it was Yuuka, they could press on her and she’d spill everything. While Yuuka always acted like a mother-figure to everyone, her embarrassed look was really cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Also, Kirishima-san and I talked about you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina and I? Why? Are you interested in our relationship? We’re just childhood friends though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your story is interesting. You two have been together since both of you were kids and you two are on good terms with each other. It’s like something out of a novel, you know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see her point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, it was something that I was already used to, so I didn’t think about our relationship that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I think my relationship with Shiina would make a better story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can I ask you something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaware of what I was thinking, Shiina asked me a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone gave me a bad feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think of Kirishima-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she even ask me that question?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person I liked was asking me about another girl, what an amazing situation I found myself in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, Kirishima Hina, huh? She was an important childhood friend of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been with me since we were kids. We were so close to the point that I couldn’t imagine living a life without her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That girl had been taking care of me, fixing my flaws as we grew up together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was always energetic and cheerful, my mood was always better when she was around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do I think of her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously, I like her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even need to think much. I liked her from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was my best friend, someone who understood me the most.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. Good for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t understand why she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I liked Hina, yes, but it wasn’t a romantic kind of like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only person I’d ever fall in love with romantically would be Shiina Mai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she was aware of this. Why did she even ask me this question?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I phrased it as if I had a romantic feeling for Hina was to make Shiina feel more at ease. If I put it this way, she wouldn’t need to worry about my feelings toward her anymore. Well, I couldn’t deny that I said it partly because I felt irritated toward her question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I was nowhere near ready to hear this kind of answer from her,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll support your love. I hope you can find your happiness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words took away the little hope that I had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It forced me to face reality that I had to give up on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shiina held my hand and beckoned me to start the treatment, I didn’t feel any excitement anymore.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“O, evil that lies deep inside, show your form before me…”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I started to cast my exorcism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a smile plastered on my face, to hide my broken heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘good for you?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was clearly lying when I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the fireworks festival, Godou held my hand, it seemed like he was trying to get closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost made a mistake thinking that he actually liked me that way. So I reaffirmed our relationship that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were merely friends. Having a friend like him made me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I had to let go of this feeling in my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mustered all my courage to find out who exactly that he liked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My guess was correct, it was Kirishima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only was she his childhood friend, she was also cheerful, cute and she was the only person who’d stay by his side to support him. Unlike me who was clumsy, gloomy, plain and troublesome. There was no reason for Godou to not like her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I knew for sure that he didn’t have any feelings for me. I could safely move on from him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I love him. I love Shiraishi Godou. Out of everyone in this world, I love him the most.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled Kirishima-san’s declaration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The depth of her feelings, I could understand it clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I knew that both of them had feelings toward each other, I could safely leave him to Kirishima-san. She’d definitely make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I’ll give them my support. May their relationship go well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Godou’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day of the ball tournament was finally upon us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone felt so excited because there was no class scheduled for today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They gathered in either the gym or the yard, depending on which game they participated in or which game they wanted to watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was currently early September. The summer heat was still lingering around, but the autumn breeze made it more bearable. At least, playing in this kind of weather was way better than playing under the blazing summer heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The tennis match is about to start!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s cheer for Sagami-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t he Misuzu’s boyfriend? Great, I wanna see what he looks like!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My girl classmates walked past me while talking with such excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was in a festive mood, which made sense because it was the sports festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I said everyone, but there was someone who was still acting like his usual self. It was this guy lying down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The said guy, Shinji, yawned and looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? I’ll do my part, so let me sleep when I’m able to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cheer for your classmates, dude.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would I? It isn’t like my cheering will make them win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cheer for Yuuka at least.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too troublesome. Besides, it’s embarrassing to cheer her out in the open like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you can get embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s called gap moe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Shinji and I were having this dumb conversation, I heard someone approaching us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see Hina in her P.E. uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you two doing? Cheer for the class! We’re going to sweep through all the matches this year!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see a blaze in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be going all out this year too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because our words wouldn’t work on her, Shinji and I decided to give up and follow her whims for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Honestly, I didn’t feel particularly motivated today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I even considered just completely ditching school. I just felt too tired to move my body around. But, if I didn’t go, my classmates would be troubled, so I had no choice but to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s exciting, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the tennis court, we could see our classmates, Satou and Takahashi, playing on the court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our other classmates were cheering for them, so we joined in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina immediately took command of everyone and started cheering from the center of the group. Meanwhile, Shinji scurried over to Yuuka’s side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t keep up with everyone’s high spirits, so I moved toward the corner. That was when I noticed someone’s gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Shiina. She was standing alone a little further from where everyone else was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked somewhat pale. At first, I hesitated on whether to call out to her or not, but my concern outweighed the awkwardness I felt toward her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes. I-I’m just nervous…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina would be playing in the basketball match if I recall correctly which wouldn’t start anytime soon. Anyway, it was understandable that she’d be nervous. Her athletic capability was zero. She was probably worried that she’d drag everyone down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take a deep breath.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re too nervous, you’ll break down during the real thing. For now, just empty your head and focus on cheering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay… I-It’s a little hard to do that though…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That seemed to ease her nerves a little, but her complexion still looked pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, everyone is heated up, but this is just a school event, they won’t really be taking it too seriously. Don’t say it out loud though. Also, even if you mess up later, no one will blame you, so take it easy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeatedly told her that everything would be okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I wanted to tell her that I’d fight anyone who’d dare to blame her, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think she’d appreciate it if I were to say that. It isn’t like I’m his boyfriend or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I only said that much to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite that, she let out a soft smile and said, “Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good luck to you too. I’ll be cheering on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard her saying that, I felt elated. At the same time, I felt dumb for being happy about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I’ve resolved myself to give up on her after all. I just wanted to become her friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I kept harboring this feeling with me, I wouldn’t be able to be a good friend for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staying beside her would be hard because of this feeling of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was the one who asked her to become my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, I had to act my own part for her sake. She was the one who went out her way to accept that request of mine, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if we couldn’t be lovers, I swore to make Shiina Mai happy as her friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as she could spend her days happily, I didn’t care if I was hurting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Well, I’m a peerless player, so you don’t need to worry about me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not! …Also, don’t you think you’re cheating?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cut me some slack. This much should be allowed. Besides, I didn’t even play soccer back in my previous life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m kidding. Well, it was because of me that you reincarnated to this world to begin with. I don’t have the right to complain if you want to use your previous life’s knowledge here… Anyway, good luck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess that logic works… Well, I’ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled as usual as I placed my fist in front of my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our first soccer match was about to begin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were matched up against a first year team, so we should be able to handle them if we just played like normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since soccer was the main event of the ball tournament, there were a lot of people coming over to watch the matches. They also provided a wide space for the spectators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was doing some lifts to pass time at the edge of the court when Hina came over to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How are you feeling? Will you be able to win?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who knows. Sakuragi will do something about it, I guess, so it shouldn’t be impossible to win. Shinji will be there too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Shinji was an ex-soccer club member, so we could always count on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll help out whenever I can.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina took a step closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her well-defined face filled my vision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is it true that the reason why you’ve been down these days is because Mai-chan dumped you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t answer that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, silence enveloped us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It just came to mind when I saw the two of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hit me on the chest when I was standing still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cheer up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it was that easy, I wouldn’t feel so depressed…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s one thing to be depressed, but using it as a reason to act like this is just lame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words hurt. Why couldn’t she just comfort me in a normal way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good luck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you so harsh on me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it’s you. I believe that you’ll get through this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did that come from? I thought I was just an overly self-conscious </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used her own words to self-depreciate myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That one is true too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should comfort me there!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you accept my words quietly if I did? You won’t. You know that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We didn’t know that. I swear, this childhood friend of mine was too strict on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Even if you’re an overly self-conscious </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you’re a total waste of a human being, I’ll always be here to help you. If it gets too hard on you, just lean on me. I’ve been doing this for a long time and that won’t change anytime soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gentle words seeped through my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, even though I knew that she was a kind girl, she wasn’t this sweet of a person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so, in exchange…” She continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Show me your cool side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It can’t be helped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a wry smile. I’m no match for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl always found a way to make my mood better. She always had my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really was a precious person to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, it was a given that I’d answer that request of hers properly.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>3</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd cheered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou, who was surrounded by three defenders, managed to dribble his way through them and scored by shooting the ball right under the goalkeeper’s crotch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls started screaming after seeing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a hero in his previous life, but he never played soccer back then. Aside from that, his current body was an ordinary one. That was why it was quite amazing for him to be able to play this well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I thought that he’d still be wearing that hateful indifferent face of his while doing this, but he didn’t. I suspected there was something going on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy was playing more aggressively than usual and he was wearing a serious expression that was totally unlike how he’d normally act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, he was playing with the intent of winning. It had been a while since I’ve seen that serious look of his.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was because there were two members of the soccer club in the opposing team, they kept marking Godou and made it difficult for him to move around. But, he managed to find an opening and moved toward the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After receiving a pass from Kudou-kun, he shot the ball toward the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like an arrow, the ball went into the right side of the goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san, who was standing next to me, made a gut pose and yelled happily, “Hurray!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She only did it because it was Kudou-kun who passed the ball to Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, he’s pretty cool sometimes, isn’t he?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t expect Kudou-kun to be this good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He is an ex-member of the soccer club. He was sick of it, that was why he quit… Still, Godou is better than him somehow. I know that he’s quite athletic, but I’d never imagine him to be this good…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a given, he was the strongest person in the world before he reincarnated to this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was also the reason why I wasn’t too amazed when seeing his performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was worried that if I were to see him like this, my feelings toward him would grow even stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a moment ago, when he showed his concern toward me, I was already at my limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt relieved that my feelings didn’t grow any stronger, but my relief was short-lived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After he scored, Godou grinned, showing his white teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Sakuragi-kun and Kudou-kun embracing him by the shoulders, he raised his right hand up to the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…He looked so cute. I can’t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The happiness on his face looked genuine, he looked so different compared to the normally calm demeanor he showed to everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I saw that gap moe, I just knew that I had already lost. I was too used to his calm look, him showing the serious look I hadn’t seen in a while and his happy look was totally unfair. I felt my chest tightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Annoying…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt so upset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did I keep yearning for something that I had already given up on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Mai-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a few coughs to deceive her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way that I’d let her know that I was fangirling over him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiraishi-kun is so cool…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? But he already got Hina. I can never win against her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is every good guy already taken?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I heard the girls behind me starting to whisper to themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san, who was in the forefront, didn’t seem to hear what they were saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice, Godou!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san waved toward him and he waved back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t the person in his line of sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was okay. I kept repeating those words over and over, trying to convince myself of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, our class managed to win all our matches and entered the finals, thanks to Godou and everyone’s hard work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost all of our classmates gathered to watch the finals as it was the only game our class was participating in during this time. Everyone was earnestly cheering for Godou and the others to win the match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The match was coming to an end. The current score was tied two to two, so the situation was tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Godou was having difficulties because he was marked by three people at all times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opposing team’s players were way more skilled than ours, save for Godou, of course. Not only that they were third-years, two of their members were the aces of the soccer club, while the rest of them were various members of the other sports-related clubs. They went all-in for the soccer game, it was obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking of how tough the situation seemed, Godou swept past all three people who blocked him and dashed away from them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as he received the ball, in the blink of an eye, he managed to get through the opposing team’s defenses and scored a goal. Immediately after that, the referee blew his whistle, signaling the end of the match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone cheered and rushed to the soccer field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was unable to keep up with everyone, so I was left alone on the bench.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone gathered in the center of the field, doing celebrations and such.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the center of everyone was the hero of the day himself, Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san stood beside him. She raised his right arm to the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her joy, Godou let out a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone from our class whistled after seeing how close those two were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that as a cue, everyone else started to join in and teased those two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He told them to stop, but at the same time, he was chuckling. It was clear that he wasn’t serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It isn’t like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Kirishima-san was blushing hard as she tried to ward the others off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good ol’ Hina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys are practically dating already, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go explode.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kudou-kun shrugged his shoulders dismissively and the others followed suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san panicked and started to make a fuss, but everyone was just looking at her warmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No matter how you look at it, those two were perfect for each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone like me, who’d only stuck by myself in the corner like this, didn&#8217;t deserve someone like Godou at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found another reason to give up on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, as if ridiculing my resolve, Godou parted ways from everyone and approached me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We won, Shiina.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? I knew that, I watched everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You cheered on me, right? Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Does that even matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pouted and turned my face away from him. Then, he spoke in a sullen tone,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, it matters. Our performance could be affected for the better when someone is cheering for us. For me, your cheering made me play better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, he covered his mouth after he said that. “For you?&#8230;” I tilted my head in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there something special about my cheering?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh yeah… I mean, you’re my friend…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t everyone in the class your friends?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like I misunderstood something. Godou shook his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a moment of silence, he told me something in a hushed tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I mean, it’s the cheer from someone that I like, of course it’s special.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone that he liked? Someone that he liked??</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Wasn’t it Kirishima-san? What? What did he mean by that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you like Kirishima-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked at me dumbfoundedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His gaze seemed like he was questioning my sanity, but that was what I should feel toward his attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, did you really take my words the other day at face value? Seriously, you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“???”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell am I doing? I’m not supposed to tell you this if I want to keep being friends with you… Wait, isn’t it better to just tell you to straight things up between us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He seemed to be mumbling about something that I couldn’t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait, could it be that the girl you like is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face turned red as he tried to avert his eyes. So cute…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No, wait, that wasn’t the time to think about that! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did he just say? Me? The girl that he liked was me??</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He liked me??</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No way that was the case, but the person himself said it clearly to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let bygones be bygones, you dumped me, after all. Let’s not talk about this again”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;W-What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? I dumped him? What was he talking about? When did I do that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my confusion, Godou explained,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oi, didn’t you tell me back in the fireworks festival that we should stay as friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-Because your actions could make me misunderstand your feelings! I just wanted to straighten our relationship up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misunderstand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I might misunderstand that you actually like me that way…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I do??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um… Y-You actually like me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to confirm this fearfully, Godou nodded his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Romantically?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Is it wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;N-No, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face reddened like a tomato, a proof that he wasn’t trying to fool me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AHH! My face started to heat up too. I could feel a wave of joy rushing through my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, you didn’t know about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Of course not! How could I notice it in the first place?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you did. So what you said to me back then wasn’t a roundabout way to reject my feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t even fathom the r in relationship. I don’t know how to do something that advanced!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to admit it, but it was true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, you haven’t dumped me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to his words. I mean, I never intended to do that in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, I don’t have to give up on you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That’s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost said that he should never give up on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I second guessed myself at the last moment. Was this really okay?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I liked him too, so if I were to say it to him, we could start dating right here and then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I was going to give up on him was because I didn’t want to betray him. He told me he wanted me to be his friend, so I wanted to fulfill that wish of him. Though, if he liked me anyway, liking him back wouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tempted by this sweet temptation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a memory from my previous life flashed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was dying while looking at the hero’s corpse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the scene moved toward the scene that I had just seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scene where Godou was smiling happily, surrounded by the other classmates with Kirishima-san by his side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just needed to nod to his question. That would be enough to make me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I couldn’t move my head. My whole body was frozen stiff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My bad. Just forget it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing my silence, Godou shook his head. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, I’ll give up on you. Can we still be friends at least?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Of course. We can still be friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though those were my own words, my chest still felt hurt. Godou let out a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. That wasn’t my intention. He was supposed to be happy, not like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, your cheers helped me. So, thank you. See ya.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t bring myself to say anything before he turned his back on me and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to reach for his back, but my hand never reached it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was practicing basketball by myself in the corner of the gym.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably because everyone else was eating their lunch, there was no one here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was decided that I’d be playing basketball, I had been practicing by myself in the park. Though, it seemed like all my efforts were futile as I was still dragging everyone down in group practices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to shoot the ball toward the ring, but it bounced back and hit the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to pick the ball up, someone had already done it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remembering the exchange we just had, I started feeling nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he was feeling the same as me as he looked unusually hesitant to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he started dribbling. Unlike my clumsy dribble, his was perfect. Even though he never really played basketball, his reflex was sufficient to make it up for his lack of experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, he shot the ball. At the same time, he finally opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Practicing on your own? What an earnest girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? Is it bad?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. That wasn&#8217;t sarcasm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ball went through the hoop flawlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing him doing it perfectly irked me. I practiced really hard, yet I still couldn’t shoot properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even back in our previous life, when I was busy calculating my moves in battle, this guy just left everything to his instincts. Seriously, how could someone be as unreasonable as him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You just started practicing, don’t think that you could suddenly be good at shooting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What should I do then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou suddenly passed the ball to me, which I tried to receive in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you put your hands out like that, you could injure your arms. Place them in front of your chest and wait for the ball to come into your hands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why so suddenly?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pass it to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, I passed the ball to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like what he told me, he placed his hands in front of his chest and received the ball flawlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll give you a slow pass, don’t get scared.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because I was afraid of the ball that I put my hands out whenever I saw it coming in my direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, when I followed what Godou told me, I managed to receive the ball properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I had never been able to receive a pass like this before. The ball always bounced off my hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice. Your shoulders are too tense though. Relax.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, Godou asked me to pass the ball to him, so I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I passed the ball, he received it, he passed it back to me. This repeated for a few more times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou calmly received all my passes. His movements were gentle, probably because he wanted me to use them as references.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I tried to imitate what he did. Of course, I didn’t have the physical capabilities to perfectly imitate his movements right away, but I wanted to be able to receive passes at least. I was lucky that Godou decided to teach me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I couldn’t practice passing by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, good. Let’s increase the speed a little.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only in times like this that he didn’t say anything stupid to me. It annoyed me a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, I was able to receive passes properly. When I let out a deep breath, Godou clapped his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You still can’t shoot or dribble properly, but at least you could pass the ball around now. That should be enough for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did he help me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dummy, the answer was obvious, it was because he liked me. Realizing that, I noticed my cheeks starting to get hotter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Sadly, I couldn’t answer that feeling. I couldn’t make him happy, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, if we became lovers, I’d be really happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I doubt that I’d be able to make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we were to stay as friends, he wouldn’t need to be burdened with someone like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t worthy of such an important position in his life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted him to be happy.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I love him. I love Shiraishi Godou. Out of everyone in this world, I love him the most.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who was worthy of him was already by his side, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The game is about to start. Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I should distance myself from him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want him to realize this feeling I had decided to bury deeply in my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my back on him, I heard a gentle “Do your best” coming from behind.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>4</b></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whistle had been blown, signing the end of the match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was running around so hard during that match. It was only after it ended that I felt the exhaustion catching up with my body. My heavy breathing wouldn’t be stopping for a while, it seemed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina-san, nice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of my classmates, Kiyama-san, approached me and hugged me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other classmates who were also members of the basketball team gathered around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got better!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you practicing by yourself? Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I just didn’t want to drag everyone down…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How gallant! And cute!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good girl, good girl. It’s my obligation to make a good girl like you happy~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get away from Yumi, Shiina-san! She’ll corrupt you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kiyama-san and my other classmate, Akasaka-san, were staring at each other. I was stuck between the two of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, it’s great that we won. The bar was raised too high because the soccer team won the whole thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s still the first round though. Well, I actually didn’t think that we could win.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even people who I’ve never talked to gathered around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, they made a way for someone to go through. Godou approached me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I did my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He told me to do my best, so I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if it affected the match as a whole, but I wanted to let him know that at least I did everything that I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him that, he blinked before laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He placed a hand on my head and gently stroked it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost let out a dumbfounded sound. What was this guy doing out in the open like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt embarrassing, but at the same time, it felt good. I wanted him to fawn over me forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No good. If this kept up, I wouldn’t be able to give up on him. The more I interacted with him, the more fond I grew of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really wanted to be his lover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If possible, I wanted to bask in this feeling for as long as I could. But at that moment, my eyes met Kirishima-san’s. She let out a sad smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost immediately, I pushed Godou away from me. The atmosphere instantly froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry… I don’t think I can be your friend anymore…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him this, his face turned sour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, you weren’t supposed to make that kind of face. Sorry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just couldn’t stay with you anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or else I wouldn’t be able to contain this feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I couldn’t afford to be your friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be too arrogant and selfish of me to be, who always brought you unhappiness, to wish to stay by your side. Though, this kind of wicked feeling was something that a former witch like me could have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to you, I finally could taste what happiness tasted like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it was your turn to be happy this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was already someone who could make you happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You wouldn’t need me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you were to stay together with me, you’d shake my resolve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feelings that I had sworn to bury deeply inside my heart would start to swell several times over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I couldn’t be with you anymore…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Godou’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after the tournament, Shiina didn’t attend school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because this happened right after that thing the other day, everyone was staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that thing happened, Shiina left the place and the whole place turned silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was looking at me, their gazes were telling me that I f**ked up somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was originally a fun tournament turned into a depressing s**tshow for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, our class got the overall second place for the whole tournament.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina was trying to cheer me up with that fact, but I was out of it for the rest of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Shiina went home early yesterday, I thought about apologizing today, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hung my head down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like what everyone thought, I f**ked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere made me get carried away and made Shiina feel uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I told her that I’d give up on her, I still did something like this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I didn’t expect such blatant rejection from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was laughable. I could feel that everyone was secretly laughing behind my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like the dumbest person in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially when I still felt that I could fix everything if I were to give her some time to cool down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just my luck, she didn’t even come to school today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told myself that she was probably overworking herself the other day and she got sick or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she still didn’t come to school for a few days after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone who was snickering at me because of the mess I made, turned to look at me with worried gazes and started asking me questions on whether everything was alright. Our homeroom teacher said that Shiina was absent because she was sick, but I kinda doubt that was truly the case…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, my worries grew as time passed by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was afraid that if I were to visit her right now, it’d have the opposite effect instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, there was a big chance that I was the reason why she was absent in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As that thought came to my mind, my body became as stiff as a rock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t do anything for her. If I were to do it, it’d just hurt her even more than this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…There really was nothing I could do for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after that, she was still absent. The atmosphere in the class turned even heavier than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Math class. I was looking out the window. It was raining heavily outside to the point that I could hear the sound of the droplets hitting the ground even though the windows were tightly shut. The damp air was sticking to my body closely and it felt uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself moving my gaze toward Shiina’s seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who usually would be taking her notes during this time of the day was nowhere in sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, daily lives without her had started to become our new routine. I hated that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, what could I do about it? I caused the whole thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you heard anything from Mai-chan, Godou?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After class was over, Hina came over to my seat and asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was weaker than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Nope.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I still had to give her treatment for her curse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really should contact her soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, should I really? Wouldn’t it be better if I were to wait for her to contact me first instead?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn’t contact her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t want to hurt her again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laid my body down on the desk as I said that. When she heard my words, Hina yanked my hand and pulled me up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staring at me with a serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think all this is okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, but there’s nothing I could do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina nodded before continuing,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t you say you were going to show me something cool?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry. I’m not cool enough of a person to do that. I’m the worst…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that I managed to do was to hurt the girl I liked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What former hero? What was that bulls**t about making her happy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only swing my sword around, the same sword that I used to hurt her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be used to protect her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when I got reincarnated, I still did the same thing. She was unhappy to the point that she decided to sever ties with me. I didn’t deserve to be with someone as kind as her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I tidied up my desk, I said my goodbye to Hina and tried to go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Godou.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina called me, but I didn’t turn around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I forgot to bring my umbrella, I decided to walk under the rain. In no time at all, my whole body was soaking wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I had to take shelter on a bench in a park on the way home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The roof above me was leaking, but it didn’t matter when my clothes were this wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stood by idly while waiting for the rain to calm down a little, I sensed someone approaching me from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t need to turn my gaze around to know that it was Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At times like this, she would be the only person who’d do something like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always had my back. It had always been this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she called out to me, I turned my gaze to her direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was as soaked as I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re going to catch a cold.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re both going to catch a cold.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t bring my umbrella, but I have my towel with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. You wiped your sweat with that towel, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I already washed it, so it’s fine. We’re childhood friends, so don’t mind it that much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a towel out of my bag and threw it to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since my bag was waterproof, the contents didn’t get wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The towel landed onto her face. Then, she used it to wipe her hair lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re soaking wet too, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t feel like drying myself. Anyway, where’s your umbrella?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took out a folding umbrella from her bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she wasn’t riding her bike right now, she probably went to the school by bus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she knew that it was going to rain today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s your bike?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like walking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s your umbrella then?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to feel the rain directly with my body.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left my bike in the school’s parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rain weakened down a little. The downpour had turned into a gentle drizzle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou, is the reason why you are like this because Mai-chan rejected you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you think she did?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know… Maybe because I disgusted her. She seemed to hate me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would explain why she treated me like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hatred toward me probably ran very deeply to the point that it was hard for her to contain it anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s true that you patting her head out of nowhere would make her uncomfortable, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of comforting me, her words just dealt more elemental damage to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to say that scene out loud because it pained me to even remember it. I hope that she could stop bringing it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, that isn’t the case when we talk about Mai-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked confident when she said that.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you know that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because she is easy to understand… Also, I understand her feelings really well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Easy to understand? Shiina?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even figure out what was happening inside that girl’s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan is kind. Too kind. I can’t believe that someone could be that kind. She has no self-confidence for some reason, even though she is that pretty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was partly because of her previous life’s memory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That girl used to be hated by everyone around her because of something that wasn’t her fault. She was stuck in self-blame all her life, that’s why she has no self-confidence. That’s also why she always tries to treat everyone who treated her warmly as kindly as she can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That explanation seemed to convince her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s why she gave up her feelings. She did it for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear her murmur, but I didn’t know what she was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou, can I tell you something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She got up from the bench and stood right in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the rainy park as the background, she looked dazzling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were drops of water running through her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Were they rain water? Were they tears?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why would she cry?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about that, her next words reached my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The look on her face told me that she wasn’t joking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As dense as I was, I knew that she didn’t mean that she liked me as a friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Though, I was aware of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After learning about love for the first time in my life, I understood what love felt like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, I noticed feelings that I had never noticed before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, she left countless hints for me to notice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I knew that the feelings she had for me were the same feelings as the one that I had for Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Will you go out with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, why did she confess to me during this time?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was smart and perceptive, she knew that I liked Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as this feeling remained, I wouldn’t be able to answer that feeling of hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, I can’t. I have someone else that I like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I went out with her, maybe this feeling would eventually disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe there would be a time when I’d finally fall for Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that if I were to stay with her, I’d be happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it was this sweet girl who had been staying by my side, supporting me without asking for anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was too good for me. I should be the one who confessed to her and begged her to stay by my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that, but I couldn’t lie to myself. So I apologized to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why are you giving up? Don’t give up that easily!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina suddenly, as if she was waiting to say those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you like Mai-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then at least ask her directly about her true feelings! It’s not like you to leave her on her own like this! If you think that you hurt her, apologize to her! How long are you going to be depressed like this?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a desperation hidden in her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every word she uttered was for my sake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I clearly dumped her just now. Even though it was alright for her to swear at me in this kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, what came out of her mouth was words of support for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to know why she went this far for me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I knew the answer to that. She loved me that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She loved me as much as I loved Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be the cool Shiraishi Godou I’ve come to love.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Within her tears, she let out a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Show me your cool side.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said the same words as she said back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I showed her a lot of my lame side, she still believed in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I wanted to answer that expectation of hers. Not out of obligation, but as something I truly wished for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I knew that there was something wrong with Shiina’s behavior lately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I was too afraid to admit it. I pretended not to notice and kept averting my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ended up being depressed while doing absolutely nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that shouldn’t be something that the cool person who Hina fell in love with do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to meet Shiina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under this rain, I looked forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I say something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I passed Hina by, I could hear her weak, trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretended not to notice the sob in between her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Your happiness is my happiness… So, go get your happiness, okay?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran. I ignored the rain as I ran forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be the cool Shiraishi Godou who Hina fell in love with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Hina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched Godou’s back until it disappeared from my sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My ten years of love was over… Was it ten years?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized my feelings for him when I was six, but I probably had started to love him even before that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Why am I always like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that I would be rejected if I were to confess to him now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always knew that he loved Mai-chan that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I hadn’t helped him, I probably had a chance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that this would happen if I gave him a push.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I knew that, but I still did it anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a bad role to play…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden voice startled me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see Shinji, who was standing nearby with his arms crossed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Since when were you there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since the beginning. I got curious because I watched you chasing him, so I followed you two here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He shrugged. I wanted to lash at him because he was stalking me, but I couldn’t exactly do that since I did the same thing to Godou just now. I guess that was why he openly announced his presence like that. Kudou Shinji was always that kind of person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m an idiot, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If your goal was your own happiness, yes, you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji with a blunt tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that isn’t the case. Your goal is his happiness, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, he was right. If my actions could make him happy, then it was worth it. There was no need for me to be depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah. I don’t mind as long as he is happy…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care what you’re trying to tell yourself, but it’s okay to cry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as Godou was happy, nothing else mattered. It didn’t have to be me who made him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No, of course not. I didn’t want that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted him to look at me. I wanted to be the reason for his happiness</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted him to stop thinking about Mai-chan. Whenever he was thinking about her, it always made me feel lonely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wanting his happiness? Wanting him to follow his feelings? Those were all lies, I didn’t want those. But at the same time, I didn’t want him to leave Mai-chan by herself. I wanted Mai-chan to be happy too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I had no regrets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to turn back time and were put in the same situation again, I knew that I’d do the same thing again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you didn’t want to cry in front of him. That’s why, cry your heart out here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was unfair, Shinji. You couldn’t say things like that out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t have the will to argue against him. My vision was blurred and I couldn’t say anything without letting out a sob. The stream that came running down my cheeks kept coming out despite my efforts to make them stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t crying. It was the rain.</span></p>
