<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Summer Vacation for the Ex-Hero and Ex-Witch</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>1</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So hot…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was practically boiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The AC in my room broke down and it’d take two more days before they finished repairing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a limit on how much you could do to ward off the heat with just a fan. In the first place, the thing only blew the hot air around instead of making it cooler. It was like pouring water onto a boiling stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One week had passed since the final exam and I somehow managed to avoid any red marks again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t a member of any club, so I had no club activities to attend. Even though I had plenty of part-time jobs, I still had a lot of free time, for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I still didn’t have the will to drag my feet outside because it was too hot to do anything. Then again, my AC was dying, so staying inside my room was hell on earth too. Not to mention that they said that this summer was hotter than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t take this anymore…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the room, went to the living room and turned the AC on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shoulda been doing this from the start. To be fair, until a while ago, I’d been sleeping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m alive…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cold breeze cooled down the sweat that had been sticking closely to my skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, it felt good. I should grab an ice cream or something to make it feel better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I did, as there were some in the fridge. I turned on the TV to find out that there was a baseball game going on at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Koshien</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The rule was runner on second, bottom ninth inning. The score was three to two and it was currently the fourth inning. Things were heating up. As I was watching it while gulping on my ice cream, the bell rang. (T/N: I’d love to understand what the baseball mambo jumbo means, but when I tried to look it up, I didn&#8217;t understand a thing.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, what the hell. We were just getting to the good part…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was currently summer break, but mom was still working and dad was out of town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, I was alone at home and I was the only one who could answer the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door, there was a beautiful girl with a familiar face standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My childhood friend, Kirishima Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, hello~ Am I bothering you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina looked at me as she waved her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a short sleeved shirt and a pair of shorts, so it showed a lot of skin. Her big breasts and meaty thighs were especially noticeable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This appearance was poisonous to a healthy teenager like me, so I coughed and averted my gaze away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes you are, I’m busy with Koshien.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since when are you part of a baseball team?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Busy watching. They were just getting to the good part.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh… I never knew you would be this excited about watching a sports match.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina, disinterestedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found sports matches interesting. They were the places where people could show off their skills and fight each other using their skills. Unlike war, there wouldn’t be any casualties, so they could fight to their heart&#8217;s content.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, if I were to tell her that, I doubt that she’d understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have clubs today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope. It’s too hot. We aren’t crazy enough to run in this heat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina barged into the house without any care while fanning her face with her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at the TV, the game was already over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Great, I missed everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was over in the fourth inning too, so someone must’ve hit the homerun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’ll be watching TV while you’re getting ready.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina as she sat down on the sofa while operating the TV remote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Getting ready? For what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buying swimsuits. It’s about time you buy a new one, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Swimsuit?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tilted my head, Hina shrugged her shoulders in exasperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t we plan to go to the pool? Tomorrow is the day…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, we planned something like that. We originally planned to go to the beach, but because of financial problems, we settled with the pool instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By we, I meant the people who went to karaoke together at the time; Me, Shinji, Hina, Yuuka and Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about Shiina’s inclusion, I smiled. Was this what they called parental affection?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that you mention it, I need a new swimsuit, yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My old swimsuit was too small for me to wear and wearing the school swimsuit for the occasion felt wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it would be the case. That’s why I’ll be dragging you out with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina with a big smile. She seemed especially happy today, good for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After changing my outfit and finishing getting ready, I went back to Hina and she pushed me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s go. Time is of the essence!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop pushing me, the swimsuits won’t run elsewhere!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They will! People will buy them and they will disappear!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s your concern, won’t the good ones be out of sale already since early summer?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, it was rare for her to buy a swimsuit just before the D-day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the kind of girl who’d finish preparing for everything a week before that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The swimsuit I bought last year doesn’t fit me anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing through my thoughts, Hina whispered to me with a slightly red face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? You haven’t grown that much, though…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, my gaze moved to her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t need to touch them to know that they were at least a size bigger than last year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where are you looking?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Time! Violence is forbidden!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina snorted and left the house ahead of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on my shoes and followed her behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, the heat is no joke…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The protection of the AC was gone and I was scorched by the hot air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I’d just go back inside after feeling this kind of heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just bear with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But since I was with Hina, I thought that enduring this kind of heat once in a while was fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went to a nearby shopping mall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took ten minutes by bike to get there from our houses. Normally, we could get there easily, but in this scorching heat, it was practically a torture. Hina, who was in a good spirit when we left, looked a little vacant on the way. The heat even drained the energy out of the normally high tension track club member. This world was dangerous…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once we got into the shopping mall, though, the AC made us feel alive again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since we’re going to buy swimsuits, we need to go to the second floor, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… But I want to take a break first. Let’s go to a coffee shop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Hina’s suggestion, we went to take a break at a coffee shop inside the mall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ordered an iced tea and Hina ordered a parfait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When her parfait came, her eyes lit up immediately. She took out her phone and took pictures out of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks so good!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clicking sound of her phone’s camera continued. Seriously, how many pictures did she want to take? After a while, she put her phone down with a satisfied look and began to eat the parfait with a spoon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tasty~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You ate lunch before coming here, didn’t you? You’ll get fat if you eat too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a separate stomach for sweets! Besides, I’ll burn the calories at my club activities, so I’ll be fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I can see you burning a lot of calories running under that kind of heat…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today’s heat is just abnormal, though. I wonder if tomorrow will be this hot too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really are used to this by now, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t have their club activities today, but normally the track club would practice every day during the summer break. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not. I almost got a heat stroke the other day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? Practicing outside sounds more dangerous after hearing you say that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it isn’t like practicing inside the gym is any better. They said it feels just the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, her skin looked darker than the last time I saw her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking closely, I could see a tan line on her arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Stop staring at me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just trying to appreciate your tan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… I’m wearing sunscreen, but the sun is still too strong…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we were talking like that, my phone shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a RINE from Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We’re going to the pool tomorrow, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, she remembered about it, it seemed. Unlike me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don’t have a swimsuit and I don’t know what to do…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the thing she sent me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, she wanted me to help her pick a swimsuit for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited for her to send another text, but that was all of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, a woman of few words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since we were at it, might as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina, can I call Shiina here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Hina blinked her eyes and asked me back,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl is having trouble choosing a swimsuit for herself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed her Shiina’s RINE message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! Sure! Call her here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Hina gave her permission, I called Shiina here.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost spit those words out, but I decided not to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because at the moment, Hina had an empty stare and her tone was unusually serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um… I’ve finished changing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina peeked through a gap behind the curtain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Hina’s eyes sparkled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me see! Let me see!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No! I-I mean… W-Wait! W-Wait, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina forcefully opened the curtain despite Shiina’s plea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Hina had her beaten completely in the chest area, but there was still plenty of meat there. Her body curved in the right places too. Meanwhile, her legs looked slender and smooth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The deep red bikini covering the important parts of her body looked rather seductive on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was hiding those important parts with her hands from my gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gesture looked so cute, but it made me inadvertently turn my gaze away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My guilty conscience couldn’t bear to look at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Don’t look at me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Too late, I already looked toward the other side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, if she didn’t want me to look at her, why did she even do this in the first place?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be shy, Mai-chan! You’re cute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina snickered like an old man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t see what she was doing, but from their voices, I understood what was happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see~ Your weak point is here!~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! S-Stop touching me at weird places!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, what the hell were they doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were still in a public place!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was struggling to decide whether I should jump in to stop their folly or not, Hina already stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, the swimsuit fitted Shiina perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure you don’t want to look at her, Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said not to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s just being shy! C’mon, take a look at this cutie~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina grabbed me by the shoulders and forcefully turned my body around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my eyes met with Shiina’s. She froze in place before panicking for a second, but she eventually settled down and placed both her hands on her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was as red as tomato and she turned it away as if not to meet my gaze. Despite that, she showed me her swimsuit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This uncharacteristic appearance of her made it hard for me to avert my gaze from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Say something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I think you’re cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I see. I-I’m going to change back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She immediately closed the curtain again. My heart was beating loudly. What was going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt the urge to run away and go back home but, at the same time, I wanted to stay here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I should calm myself down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a deep breath and regained my composure immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the battlefield, keeping your emotions in check was a necessity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to my training, I could regain my composure with a single deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heartbeat started to slow down as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Now that the adrenaline had subsided, a wave of embarrassment came rushing to me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell are we doing in this kind of place?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a good thing that there were no other people in our vicinity. If there were, it would be really embarrassing. Calling Shiina ‘cute’ was bad enough already, I didn’t need any more hits to my dignity…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and turned my gaze to the side… Only to see Hina staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina as she turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, she just walked away from me. Since she was bringing her swimsuit around, she probably went to pay for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not long after, Shiina came out of the fitting room and said that she’d be buying the red swimsuit after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t bring myself to look at her, so I just nodded my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you? Are you not going to try on yours?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it should be fine in my case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike with women’s swimsuits where you’d need to consider the chest and waist size, men’s swimsuits were practically just shorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not fair, I want to see yours too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you’ll see me wearing it tomorrow anyway…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right… Now that I think about it, a lot of people will see me wearing that swimsuit…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If you hate it, you don’t need to go, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I didn’t want people to stare at her that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Besides, I got to let you see it before anyone else…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had such a conversation as we stood in line and headed to the cash register.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I wanted to ask what she meant by saying that, but I was too afraid to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, it was hard for me to say what was in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Talking to friends wasn’t supposed to be this hard, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking of that, the cashier had finished counting everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey~ Over here~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina, who went ahead of us, waved at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look what I got~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though we had finished what we came here for, it seemed like we’d still be staying for a while longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, Shiina was used as Hina’s dress-up doll for the rest of the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We only broke up after Shiina was exhausted.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>3</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The following day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As planned, we went to the pool together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a pool nearby that we could go to, but instead of going there, we went to the most famous one in the prefecture. To get there, we had to take a thirty minute train ride.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we decided to meet up at Maebashi Station first at 9am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because my internal clock was a mess during the summer vacation, it was hard for me to wake up at nine. Though, that problem was resolved because Hina barged into my house and woke me up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got ready and went to the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we too early?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived, no one else was there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I knew this would be the case, I’d just go back to sleep instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Better to be early than late. We have to fix that tardiness of yours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina. I couldn’t retort to her because I knew that she was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The station was deserted at this hour. The quiet atmosphere made it hard to believe that this was normally a bustling station. There was a McDonald&#8217;s nearby, so Hina and I went there to eat our breakfasts while waiting for the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first one to appear was Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, she tied her black hair in a side tail. The simple short-sleeved shirts and long skirt matched her gentle-looking face and gave her a calm impression. Overall, her outfit fitted her personality perfectly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning. It’s been a while, Godou. When was the last time we hung out together, again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The last day of school, so it’s been a while. I heard you hung out with Hina a couple of times?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm! She always called me whenever she wanted to go shopping. Why didn’t you join in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina never invited me. Well, you guys probably hung out when I had a shift.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s one reason. But the real reason why I didn’t invite you is that you are always trying to find a reason to go home early.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you always take a long time to shop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went shopping with Hina occasionally, but doing it with her was extremely tiring. I knew that girls normally took their time to shop, thanks to my mom’s guidance, but Hina’s shopping time easily doubles your average girl’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was getting fed up by the thoughts of accompanying Hina shopping, Shinji sent me a RINE.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told him to go to McDonald&#8217;s and he sent a sticker of a bear chasing after butterflies. I didn’t know what he was trying to convey here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Yuuka, who was drinking her coffee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why aren’t you with Shinji?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you asking that? We aren’t always together, okay!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her lips twitched a bit in dissatisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Shinji came over to our seats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We actually went together. She said that she doesn&#8217;t want you guys to get the wrong idea, so she made me hide in the toilet and went ahead to meet up with you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shinji!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka blushed and tried to block Shinji’s mouth with her hands, but the latter parried her move well and sat down right next to her. Seeing her plan failing, Yuuka puffed her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should just keep quiet, dude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, seeing the normally calm and composed Yuuka being this upset was quite something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was going to, but the timing was just right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji shrugged his shoulders as he let out his usual frivolous smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was wearing a short sleeved blue shirt and black loose shorts. There was a silver necklace hanging by his neck and a watch on his wrist. He also wore cool-looking sandals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, he looked stylish and fashionable. The gap between his appearance and mine was like heaven and earth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, you two are as close as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are not! I brought him with me because I was afraid that he’d be late!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina shrugged off Yuuka’s excuse..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such a handful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at yourself in the mirror. You’re as tardy as me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the record, I came here fifteen minutes earlier than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only because Hina dragged you out of your bed earlier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without Hina, I knew that I was a better person than him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You both are the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Yuuka as she stared at our quarrels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the four group of friends gathered inside the Maebashi Station’s McDonald’s in the early hour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only Mai-chan left, right?” Hina asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my watch and noticed that it was already nine. It was unusual for her to be late. That girl was the kind of person who’d wait for an hour before the appointed time. Did something happen to her?</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll give her a call.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I said that and opened my phone, Shiina called me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{S-Sorry! I-I’m almost there… I think…}</span></i></p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4410" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-727x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="727" height="1024" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-727x1024.jpeg 727w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-213x300.jpeg 213w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-768x1082.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2-1090x1536.jpeg 1090w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-2.jpeg 1263w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear her rough breathing over the phone. Is she running?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. What happened to you, though?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something big must have happened if Shiina, out of all people, was late.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{U-Um… I-I got lost…}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her response broke my serious mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, even back in her previous life, she had no sense of direction whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I-I haven’t used the train much, okay?! I-It’s a given that I’d be lost!}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Excuses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she hadn’t used the train much, how could she not know where the station was?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been living here since July, how could she not know about this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever. We’re at the McDonald’s in the station, so come here quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I didn’t understand what was going on in that head of hers. I had a premonition that something messy was about to happen today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes later, we left the McDonald’s and met up with Shiina at the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a white blouse and black shorts. Her long black hair was tied to a ponytail. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw her in her casual outfit just yesterday and today she wore a different style of outfit. For a clumsy girl like her, she was surprisingly stylish…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, Mai-chan in a ponytail! Cutie!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shiina was still apologizing with teary eyes, Hina hugged her with a twinkle in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re only three minutes late, no need to apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Thank you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yuuka smiled calmly at her, she let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka led the way and the rest of us followed behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I didn’t know the way to the pool, but Hina and Yuuka should know it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the students were having their summer vacation, the adults were still working. Thanks to that, the train was empty. Everyone was sitting side by side. Shiina sat on my left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…For some reason, she sat really close to me. Our arms even touched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji, who sat on the left side of Shiina, looked at me with bafflement. From his point of view it felt like Shiina was avoiding him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m so nervous…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whispered Shiina to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I should be the one who’s nervous here.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never went to the pool with my friends before…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correction, it’s your first time hanging out with your friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I teased her like that, she retorted,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The karaoke counts, okay?! A-Anyway, this is the first time I’m riding a train with everyone…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood what she meant. Unlike back when we went karaoke together, today’s outing had a different feeling to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What am I supposed to do in the pool?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Swim. If you can swim, it’ll be fun playing around in the pool.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I said that, I remembered that she told me that she couldn’t swim just the other day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re going to teach me how to swim, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she looked at me with a nervous gaze, I turned my head away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’ll do my best…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her physical abilities, it would be hard for her to be able to swim right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, she seemed to be bringing a float with her, so she’d be able to have fun on her own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, wouldn’t it be better if Hina or Yuuka were to teach you instead?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, she tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to teach her how to swim, I might accidentally touch her body or something…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, her face turned red as she understood what I was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-If it’s you… I-I don’t mind…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her head after muttering something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, wait, what the hell was that?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You don’t mind? What?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, she drove me crazy. She always said something like this nowadays, I couldn’t understand her anymore!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we fell to silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air between us turned awkward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to look around, there were only empty seats around us. Shinji, who sat next to Shiina, was absorbed in his phone game. Hina and Yuuka were planning our schedule while looking at a pamphlet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t bring any of them to the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do now?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unaware of my inner thoughts, Shiina smiled and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, me too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled wryly in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The former witch, Shiina Mai, managed to smile from the bottom of her heart. I didn’t want anything much. If I could be part of the reason behind that smile, that would be enough for me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>4</b></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Shiina nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Lately, you kept avoiding making eye contact with me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina giggled as she said that. I couldn’t say anything to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s stop talking and have some fun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka with a cheerful voice. It seemed like she was done messing around with Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank God, she didn’t hear our embarrassing conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, Shinji seemed to hear us, but I pretended not to notice him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before doing anything, we spread a sheet near the edge of the room and secured a place to sit on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka and Hina prepared the area well. After we were done placing our luggages on the sheet, Hina held her hand to the sky and said energetically,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go to the flowing pool!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone raised their hands in unison, including Shiina, though she wasn’t as energetic as the rest of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We then headed toward the flowing pool. Shiina had a float in her arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s a flowing pool anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… It’s a donut-looking pool with a stream of water running through it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know the details, but it sounded about right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you swim there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to. There’s a stream there, so it’s enough to just float around. The pool itself is shallow, so you can stand there. You don’t need to worry about drowning. If you’re still scared, you can just hold on to your float.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Got it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina clenched her fists and placed them in front of her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You don’t need that kind of determination to go there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Yuuka and Hina jumped into the water while screaming. Shinji followed along while sitting on a float while floating lazily inside the pool. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina tried to get into the water, but got scared when her toe touched it. She then looked at me with teary eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don’t get in there quickly, everyone will leave you behind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I know! It’s all gonna be okay… It’s okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was trembling. Was she really okay?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the water first and offered my hand to her. She took my hand as she slowly got into the water. What a troublesome woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I let out a sigh, I felt a soft sensation on my right arm. Almost instantly, my heart started to beat faster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hey! I-Idiot, why are you clinging to me?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m scared, okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down first! I told you the pool is shallow! You can stand in the water!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I said that, she noticed that her feet actually touched the bottom of the pool. Then, she immediately scurried away from me with a red face. I felt lukewarm gazes all around us. Help me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here’s your float.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed the float on her head and pulled it down to her waist. While scowling, Shiina grabbed the sides of the float and started to float away following the stream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Waah, I-I’m being swept away!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let it be. You’ll get used to it quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed my hand on her float and floated next to her while occasionally dodging people around us. Shiina looked nervous for a while, but her expression gradually turned relaxed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It feels good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you. I feel tired already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that while shrugging my shoulders, Shiina apologized,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry… I troubled you so much today…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…C’mon, if you apologize earnestly like that, I’d feel bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like I was guilt tripping her somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it. We’re friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, she beamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right at that moment, someone came out of the water right in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pwah! Heya~ Doing good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a pair of goggles, but I could tell that she was Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re too energetic, you know that? Take a look at Shinji, he’s enjoying life properly over there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed at Shinji, who was floating lazily while gazing at the sky. Seriously, what the hell was he doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you having fun, Mai-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’m having fun. Though, I was a little scared at first…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina looked puzzled, so I explained to her,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She can’t swim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?! Then, you didn’t need to force yourself to follow us!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s fine… If I don’t do this, I won’t be able to have fun with everyone…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she was moved by Shiina’s words, Hina’s eyes twinkled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan! I love you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she tackled Shiina and hugged her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, came a big splash of water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The float turned upside down. Not long after both of them came out from below it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, don’t do that. She’ll drown.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I warned, but Hina didn’t listen to me at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two girls stared at each other and laughed soon after. I don’t understand those two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at her like this, Shiina looked like a normal high school girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, you should join us too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?! It’s going to flip— Woah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile in front of us, Yuuka forcibly pulled Shinji away from his float.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after that, there was a big splash of water. Yuuka turned toward us and gave us a peace sign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shinji appeared from the water, grabbed her shoulders and dragged her down into the water. Another big splash of water appeared as both Shiina and Hina laughed at the sight. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was having fun, good for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…By the way, both Yuuka and Shinji seemed to not mind touching each other. They were scuffling in the water, though from my position, they seemed to be hugging instead. How envious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, I felt nervous whenever Shiina touched me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, let’s go to the slide!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking Hina’s words as a cue, we left the flowing pool. Both Hina and Yuuka energetically went to the slide. Meanwhile Shiina…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That… I don’t think I can…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you can’t swim, so you shouldn’t push yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m bad with things like that in the first place… I can’t even ride a roller coaster…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You flew with a broomstick back in your previous life. What are you so scared about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like she was afraid of heights. Shiina’s lips twitched as she spoke,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can control my broomstick, but I can’t control those!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t understand at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I’m tired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s just stay here until everyone comes back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… I’m going to the toilet first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said before going to the toilet by herself. I sat down and enjoyed this quiet time by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, suddenly Shinji came to me with a can of coffee in both arms. He threw one of them at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not going to the slide?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I caught the can and opened it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, not in the mood for it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sat down next to me and wiped his hair with a towel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina-san is so attached to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You think so too, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that was what it looked like from an outsider’s perspective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how you look at it, you two look like an idiotic couple, flirting in front of everyone like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words stung my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that we looked like that from everyone else’s perspective, but when someone actually pointed it out at me, it felt really embarrassing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This all happened because Shiina didn’t have a sense of distance. I should teach her quickly about this. If she were to treat everyone like she treated me, people would be bound to misunderstand her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you going to do about this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what he meant by that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, at least I knew that he was being serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, he’d laugh carefreely in this kind of situation, but right now, he stared at me without any hint of being playful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it, but I still couldn’t understand his question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I asked back. Shinji placed his coffee down silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence enveloped us. After a while, he opened his mouth to speak,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looking at you two like that, it’s hurting Hina, don’t you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you sure she isn’t just sick or something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve known each other since we were kids, so I knew that Hina had been forcing herself for a while now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She always tried to act a little more cheerful whenever she was feeling down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, unlike the guy beside me, I wasn’t that perceptive, I didn’t know the reason why she was feeling down in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji said that she was hurt, but I simply couldn’t understand why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stared at my troubled face. It seemed like he understood what was in my mind, so he told me,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’re dense and all, but before I’m telling you everything, you have to sort out your feelings first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…His answer only made me even more confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trusted his words, though. Based on my experience, he was never wrong in this kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh, Kudou-san is here too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Shiina returned from the toilet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I’m getting old, I get tired quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aren’t we the same age?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina giggled at Shinji&#8217;s joke before sitting down next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, this girl has become more comfortable with our group of friends as she was able to talk with the others normally. Though, it didn’t seem like she’s going to drop the honorifics on everyone’s names.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m an old man mentally.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us remained silent after hearing that joke. He was taken aback by our reaction. I mean, both of us had memories from our previous lives, so we didn’t find the joke funny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Rather, the fact that he was more mature than us was funnier than the joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered to Shiina,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If we were to count our ages from our previous lives, we’d be over thirty right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like an old man now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, that’s not how it works. We didn’t immediately remember our previous lives, so we can’t just add our total ages like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she was saying was correct, but it wasn’t convincing because of her rapid fire speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, Shiina Mai and Cerys Flores are two different people! You said so, didn’t you?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t use my inspirational speech to make yourself sound younger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not old! Don’t you dare call me old!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were arguing, Shinji shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop flirting in front of me…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-We are not!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Shiina while denying his claim. For some reason, her cheeks were flushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her like that made me feel embarrassed too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing us, Shinji held his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He probably didn’t know what to say to us.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>5</b></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A while later, Yuuka and Hina returned. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, everyone sat together on the sheet while resting and discussing what we should do next.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should we do? It’s still too early for lunch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at the clock and realized that Yuuka was right as it was still 10.30.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanna go to the pool over there with Godou. It’s been a while since we’ve fought!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina took on a stance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she lightly tapped my chest with her fist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, but you should be aware that no matter how much you try, you’ll never defeat me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina had always tried to challenge me in all sorts of competitions, including but not limited to running and swimming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, no matter how much she tried, she could never defeat me except in studying. Gender differences aside, I was a hero in my previous life, my basic specs were ahead of your average joe to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to win this time! Just wait and see!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pointed her finger at me before walking toward the pool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she had regained some of her vigor. I guess playing around in this place helped her with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what was wrong with her, but as long as she looked this cheerful, everything should be okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, I felt someone staring at me from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… U-Um… Good luck?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she sound so unsure? Well, whatever. I nodded at her while making a strong fist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been thinking about it for a while now… But your muscles are something…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was staring at my body for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I knew that my muscles were noticeable if I was dressed like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because I trained them well. There are no downsides to having more strength, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I stopped trying to sacrifice my well-being for others, I still continued to help them. For that reason, having more strength would help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it was only with strength that I could choose whether I’d help someone or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were unable to help someone who was asking for my help, I’d never forgive myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I regained my memory, I had been training my muscles and I continued to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Yuuka joined in between our conversations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right! I didn’t notice it when you had your shirt on, but your muscles are quite something!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She proceeded to touch my belly. It tickled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji was staring at me with an envious gaze. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This isn’t my fault, stop staring at me like that!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka then proceeded to lecture Shinji while pointing at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, Shinji, follow his example and start training your muscles!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want you to lump me together with him. Also, I have some muscles too, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least I don’t have excess fat in my belly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?! H-Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka blushed and became angry as Shinji said something unnecessary again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji ran toward the pool and Yuuka chased after him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They got along well, good for them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Hina was busy warming up for our ‘fight’. Her atmosphere was completely serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou! I’m risking my life here, why are you so relaxed?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, my bad. Alright, let’s do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina called out to me, clearly frustrated. Since she was so eager, I decided to take her seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We competed in 50-meter freestyle swimming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to know, I completely overwhelmed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was frustrated with the outcome. This girl really hated to lose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the more time passes, the more pronounced the gender difference gets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from that, in her case specifically, she had to deal with the water resistance due to her massive… Ahem…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Your gaze is disgusting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What do you mean by that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina glared at me as I whistled to avoid her glare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she let out a deep sigh before tilting her head in puzzlement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where did Mai-chan go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw Shinji and Yuuka swimming, but I failed to see Shiina anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But there was a big splash of water in the middle of the pool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bad feeling about it, so I immediately swam in that direction. When I got closer, I saw the idiot flailing her limbs around. I didn’t know how she got there, but she was clearly drowning!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held her body and dragged her to the surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I stopped caring about touching her or whatnot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was in danger!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, are you okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“*Cough* …S-Sorry… The pool is deeper than I thought…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina then clung to me tightly. She looked frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least the water didn’t enter her lungs or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She only coughed a lot, but she didn’t seem to be in any serious danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I felt relieved by that fact, I became conscious of the sensation of her clinging to my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay, Mai-chan?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina asked when she caught up with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji and Yuuka also came over after finding out that something wrong had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I pulled Shiina out of the pool first. When we got out, she apologized with a sullen expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, I troubled everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, as long as you’re okay in the end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina patted her chest, relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, don’t worry. It’s Godou’s fault that he didn’t look over you properly even though he knows that you can’t swim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you acting like you didn’t do anything wrong at all?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka glared at Shinji, who was acting pompous like usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, both of them also ended up comforting the depressed looking Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina, who was on the verge of tears earlier, looked at this scene with a dumbfounded look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;See? You don’t need to worry. No one blames you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whispered this to her, Shiina looked at me with a serious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone knows you’re an airhead, so don’t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that one loudly for everyone else to hear it. They laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I know that you’re bad in P.E. and stuff…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji while shrugging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re always so fidgety too~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka while giggling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to worry though, your clumsiness is what makes you cute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hina probably said that to make her feel better, but she didn’t deny that the girl was clumsy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone looked at Shiina with warm gazes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">See, Shiina? You don’t need to worry.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone here is your friend.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you don’t think so, they all think of you as their friend.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">So, there’s no need to be afraid. You can be happy in this world.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, our feelings reached her. She mustered her courage and shouted,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not an airhead!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, the content of her shout wasn’t really convincing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>6</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I loved Shiina Mai. Not as a friend, but as a woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated to admit it, but that was my true feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finally admitted it, it felt better than I thought it would be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I loved her, I wanted to hug her so badly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I found something I want to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since the day when Hina scolded me, I had been looking for a new goal to achieve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something that I wanted to do. I wanted to decide how to live my own life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was difficult for me. After all, for the longest time, I had been living according to my heroic codes. Hell, I couldn’t even admit my own feelings until today. But now, I finally realized what I wanted to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to always stay by her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to get to know her better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I wanted to kiss her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina blinked her eyes before smiling happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s great. Do you mind telling me about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked that with an innocent smile on her face. Immediately after that, my face heated up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell was I doing? Of course, she would ask about it if I were to say it like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even have the courage to confess yet. It hadn’t been an hour since I realized my feelings, it was too early to confess…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It’s a secret!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t give me that! Tell me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to hide it from her, she pressed me even more aggressively instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’ll tell you when the time is right!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I’ll tell her. Just not now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I liked her and I wanted to get to know her better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do that, I have to confess to her and get into a relationship with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no need for me to rush things. After all, if she were to reject me, then everything would be over for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I should deepen our friendship first and make her look at me more favorably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…As for how, I don’t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was going to be difficult, wasn’t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Would this troublesome woman even fall in love with someone that easily in the first place?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, we used to be enemies. We were friends now, but her starting affection points were in the negative, so this was trickier than normal. This was more difficult than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Why do you look so down? You’re more expressive than usual today…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina with a confused look. Of course she would be confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was confused by my own feelings too, let alone her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t believe that you’re the man who never laughed back in your previous life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Shiina said, I was a different man from my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I always tried to hide my emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, my current self is better than back then at least.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, we couldn&#8217;t be stuck in the past forever. We weren’t Grey Handlet and Cerys Flores anymore. We were Shiraishi Godou and Shiina Mai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, Shiina laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it’s easier to guess what you’re thinking right now compared to back then. You were more scary back then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Scary? How so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was hard to pick the conversation deck when I talked with you. I mean, I couldn’t read what was in your mind, after all…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl actually prepared conversation decks to talk with me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it just because you have no social skills whatsoever?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-So what?! Humans are innately scary, you know?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina started to make some absurd claims, so I tried to calm her down. As I was doing that, I heard footsteps approaching us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced over my shoulder to see an exhausted looking Yuuka and Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m tired… I can’t believe I went around playing that much…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re this tired, then think about how I feel… Huh, what’s wrong, you two? Did you two fight again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We didn’t! This man just keeps abusing me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina had become better at talking with everyone after the previous event at the pool. Now, she was able to talk with a normal tone with everyone other than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?! Why are you being so mean to her, Godou?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, for some reason everyone always took her side whenever something happened. I hope that they’ll realize one day that everything that came out of this woman’s mouth was pure nonsense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Godou is always a sinful man, we all know this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Yuuka was standing firmly on Shiina’s side, Shinji started to insult me instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He ignored my hostile glare and looked around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, where did Hina go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, come to think of it, she disappeared for a while now…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until a while ago, the place where Shiina sat was Hina’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina came right after Hina went to the toilet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it had been more than ten minutes since she left, she was awfully late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said she went to the toilet, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe she has an upset stomach?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Yuuka. Then, I heard someone approaching us from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka, who didn’t notice it, had her back hit by Hina’s chop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was buying some snacks over there! What the hell are you saying?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hina as she showed off her chocolates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, Yuuka just sighed in relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…There was something about Hina’s behavior that made me curious, but I decided to shut my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we left the pool and headed home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While everyone was talking about how much fun they had, I was looking at the window while thinking about Hina’s strange behavior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that she was buying some snacks, but was it really the case?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my combat experience from my previous life, I could easily sense other people’s presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know who it was, but there was someone who was staring at me and Shiina from a distance when we talked. I had a suspicion that it was Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I didn’t have the slightest idea why she was lying like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably, it was just my imagination.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I know you’re dense and all, but before I’m telling you everything, you have to sort out your feelings first.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Shinji’s words came to my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Hina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was also exhausting…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I manage to smile properly?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was able to act like normal, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was Godou, he probably noticed that I wasn’t feeling well, but he wouldn’t know the reason why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Shinji seemed to notice what was going on, though. He gave me quite the stare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hina?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou, who was walking next to me, called out to me. He was probably worried about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were walking home together after splitting up with everyone at the Maebashi Station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine. I’m just a little tired…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t lie. I was really fine, I was just tired…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou let out a wry smile and continued walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance between us was closer than normal friends, but it wasn’t as close as lovers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since we were kids, we always managed this much distance between us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always thought that we’d be doing this for a while longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like I didn’t have the desire to close the distance between us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just afraid that if I were to do that, I’d suddenly lose the position I was currently in. I was happy enough with the status quo after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, whenever the thought of him ending up with someone else pained me. Whenever I saw his happy face when he talked with Mai-chan, my chest started to hurt and it became hard for me to breathe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I liked him more than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all this time, I only just realized that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, it wasn’t like I wanted him to be mine. As long as he stayed by my side, it would be good enough for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this time, I naively believed that because we had known each other ever since we were kids, even if we didn’t become lovers, I’d be able to stay by his side forever. I thought that even if one day, he suddenly found someone he liked, I’d still be able to stay by his side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I realized that I couldn’t do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> scene, I couldn’t even think of getting in their way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was clear that those two loved each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at the man next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou looked a little tired as he stared at the sunset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to believe that this was the same man who cried earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t even notice that his eyes were a little swollen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was the first time I’ve seen him cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even back when we were kids, I’ve never seen him cry even once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how absurd of a situation he faced, he always braved through it calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was unthinkable that he’d have that kind of silly face when he cried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that he showed that face of his to another girl made me feel jealous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though this whole time, I was always by his side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, he suddenly became close with a girl that suddenly appeared in our lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if those two were bound by the red string of fate.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou, can you tell me?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do you only show your weak side to her?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do you care about her so much?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do you push yourself so hard for her?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I need to stop thinking about it, or else, I’d start hating myself. Being jealous like this was the worst thing I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, I should get home quickly, get into my bed and try to forget everything that happened today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Though, I don’t think I could recover from this for a while.</span></p>
