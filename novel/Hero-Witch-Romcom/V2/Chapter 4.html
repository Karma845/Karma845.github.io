<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Eternal Love</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterward, I visited Shiina’s house, but no reply came from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably wasn’t at home as the place seemed empty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That meant she had gone somewhere. Now, where did she go?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought of all the places I could think of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a place from my previous life came to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A high place. Back in our previous life, whenever the witch felt depressed or wanted to be alone, she always went to a high place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where was the highest place nearby?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately racked my brain to look for any possible places where she could be at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the roof of this high-storied apartment? No. School roof? No. The park near Akagi Mountain? No… Wait, it was raining, so it should be safe to assume that she wouldn’t be outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A high place that wasn’t outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I figured it out immediately. The Gunma Prefecture’s Government Office, there was an observation hall that you could visit freely on the 32nd floor. I immediately went there and when I got to the observation hall, I saw a black-haired girl there, standing by the window while looking at the night’s view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because it was a weekday night or because this was just how empty Gunma was, the hall was devoid of any human presence save for us and the security guards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shiina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, her shoulders shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to face me with a fearful look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was ridden with anxiety as she blinked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you drenched like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? I thought I wiped it off properly…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrung out my clothes and dried them a bit before I entered the building so that the water wouldn’t drip all over the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you looking for me in the rain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, so what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you do that?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you skipped school for how many days now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked unwell, but I didn’t know the cause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? You didn’t catch a cold, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? That’s great then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There goes one of my worries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn’t sick, so it was all good in that regard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a possibility that she was unwell because of her curse acting up again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, from that sharp glare of hers, I could assume that there was no problem in that regard too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you even worry about me? We aren’t friends anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is that the case? You can’t just cut me off without telling me anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried to say something but immediately shut her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was she like this? Couldn’t she just tell it straight to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, why did you skip school? Is it because you don’t want to see me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept her mouth shut. Her silence answered the question. My heart started to ache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you avoiding me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I’d get hurt by her answer, I needed it, or else we wouldn’t get anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was avoiding me because she felt burdened because of my love for her or because I did something to offend her or even because she just hated me in the first place, whatever the answer was, I still had to ask her for her forgiveness and a chance to make up with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you not understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not, I’m not a mind reader.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was puzzled by her words, she screamed in a desperate voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s because I like you!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My thoughts went blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woman, what the hell?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She liked me? What?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-If that’s the case then, what’s the problem?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Never did I expect this kind of response to come out of her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everything!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina as she waved her hands like a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-If I were to say that I like you, wouldn’t that mean we can go out?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell was she even talking about? I didn’t have enough braincells to understand her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah? Then, we can just go out??”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would want that. What was the problem?!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can’t! …No, we actually can, but no!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I lost her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Were we even talking in the same language?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we go out, then I’ll be the only one who’ll be happy! I won’t be able to make you happy and I hate that! What’s the point of us going out if you won’t be happy?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the reason why she had been avoiding me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you go out with me, of course I’ll be happy too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head before starting her speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;This isn’t a storybook. Our life wouldn’t end with us going out and living happily ever after. It’ll go on even after that. I trust you to be able to make me happy, but if our relationship is so one-sided like that, you’ll eventually break up with me because you can’t take it anymore. That’s how our relationship will end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W-What the hell was that pessimistic view…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, it wouldn’t be Shiina if she didn&#8217;t act this way…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so, you’d rather not go out with me instead?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Besides, there should be someone out there in this world that deserves to be with you more than I am.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Someone that deserved to be with me, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely, there were plenty of girls that were way, way less troublesome to deal with than her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I knew that I wasn’t any better than her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I liked that part of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Like Kirishima-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina in a whisper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stopped speaking after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was why she had been avoiding me. And that was the reason why Hina gave me a push like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I admire Hina even more now. I have to live up to her expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To do that, I had to persuade this stubborn girl in front of me to reach a happy ending with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you implying that I should go out with Hina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. She’s your childhood friend, she’s always been by your side, not to mention that she likes you. There’s no one better than Kirishima-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Look at her, her pained expression when she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said all that, but she looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I just dumped her before I came here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, Shiina showed me a surprised look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Why?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a step closer to her and grabbed her by the shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our face was so close that our noses almost touched. With our eyes locked at each other, I cry out my feelings to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I don’t want to give up on you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears trickled from the corner of her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl was prone to overthinking, self-hatred and depression. She hated her current state, but she was too used to it to try to move on from it. In a way, you could say that she was bad at handling her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Luckily for her…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how unhappy she became, I’d do my best to make her happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was my resolve, my wish, even back before I reincarnated into this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that going out with me would make her happy. There was no need to hesitate anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strike while the iron is hot, they said. I’ll slam this overflowing feeling of mine to her, so she could understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina. Let me make this clear to you. I love you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see her eyes shaking when she heard my words, but she still kept her face down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But, Kirishima-san has always been in love with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I know that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I like Hina too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really want to make her happy too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the only person that I love romantically is Shiina.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Thanks to you, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw her smile back then, I felt so happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like I was saved. Her existence saved me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked so beautiful that I couldn’t help but be entranced by that beauty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to spend all my life with her, to see her smile again and again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as she could spend her days with that smile on her face, I would be content. That was enough to make me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why… To someone like me?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop devaluing the person that I love.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shoulders shook when I told her this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, but this feeling of mine isn’t so trivial that I could just give up on it on demand. It’s useless to try to run away from me! I will never let you go unless you go out with me! So, prepare yourself, I’ll chase you to the end of the earth, Shiina! Fuhahaha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Wait, that sounded wrong somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, I mean, we love each other anyway, so there should be no problem even if I say it like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a slight annoyance, Shiina yelled at me,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I love you more than you love me! You can’t beat my love for you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! I love you more than you love me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way that’s the case! All I can think about before I go to sleep every night is the conversations I had with you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I always find myself staring at you in class! I do it all the time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-Is that so?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face was getting hot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, that’s the reason why I can’t go out with you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you can’t make me happy? Why do you care so much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because all I can do is make you unhappy! I already made you unhappy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s in our previous life. Now it’s different. You are not a witch anymore and I’m also not a hero anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, but that doesn’t change anything! We’re still the same person as back then inside!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you feel the need to make this so complicated…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t understand. Unlike Kirishima-san, I don’t have the strength to support you! To receive your love one-sidedly is too much of a burden for me! I’m fine with staying as your friend!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently Shiina was obsessed with whether or not she could support me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do I look so unreliable to you that you think I need someone to support me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. If someone doesn’t support you, you’ll become unhappy soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to hear that from you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pointed that out, Shiina turned her face down and muttered, “&#8230;You have a point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, don’t get depressed now…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you calm down later, you’ll understand what I’m talking about. Love is blind, isn’t it? You’re in that state right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the problem stemmed from this girl’s abnormally low self-esteem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t believe in the concept of someone liking her in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep down, she didn’t believe that I liked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wrong. I love you! No matter what, I’ll always love you! Whether love blinds me or not, it doesn’t matter!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop saying such things…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t stop! This is not about me, this is about my love for you! I like you because you’re you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t accept that love!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what do I have to do to convince you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me one thing you like about me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She puffed out her chest with confidence. She seemed sure that I could never name a single good thing about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What amazing confidence, even though it was in a negative direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll tell her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One by one, I’ll list the good points of Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay, first of all, I like your face. You were pretty back in our previous lives and right now you don’t look any worse. Even among the idols, you look the prettiest, the prettiest in the world! You need to be aware of that, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What ‘prettiest in the world’? Why do I need to be aware of that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a narcissist,” she continued with flushed cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Secondly, I like your kindness. People always treated you badly, but you still treated them kindly even though no one would blame you if you were to give none of those people mercy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A-Ahem. Y-You know that it’s useless to flatter me like this, right? I already love you to begin with, so no matter how hard you try to seduce me it won’t change anything. Too bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina. She sounded so sure that she had strong logic backing up her words. Her words were all over the place though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored the idiot’s words and continued talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I like the way you treat me. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but it feels comfortable. When you opened your heart to me, you closed your distance from me and it made me feel that you’re depending on me. I like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is that so?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked away while being fidgety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I like your attitude when you try to shun people away. You looked like you can’t bear to treat them harshly and always try to look out for them after you shunned them away. That clumsiness of yours, I like it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she hid her face, I couldn’t see her expression anymore, but I could tell that her ears were bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I like your happy look whenever you’re telling me a story. Your voice turns gentler than usual, you become more expressive and happy. I like the bright expression you made whenever I managed to sympathize with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a whisper, she said “Please stop…” while covering her face with her hands. Too bad for her, I won’t stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I like your smile. I like the way your cheeks move like a blooming flower.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word ‘like’ kept coming from my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love her so much. I’ve always had my eyes on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the beginning, I was drawn to her and recently, that feeling bloomed into love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to make her happy, to see her smile and to be always with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I get it, I get it, just stop!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love everything about you. I love your troublesome side, your clumsiness, your low self-esteem, your inadequacy as a human being, I love everything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Enough already… I know that you love me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, you should know how happy I’d be if I were to go out with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina shifted her hands that were covering her face and glanced at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Should we really… Go out?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what she was thinking, but I could see clearly that her face was getting redder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-As expected, we shouldn’t! If we do, I won’t be myself anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you on about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll go crazy because I’ll become too happy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be in the boat as you, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But, if we were to become lovers, there’s a chance that we’d break up. If that were to happen, that’ll be the end of our relationship, we can’t even turn back into friends anymore. If I have to go through that, it’ll be better for us to stay as friends…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing, she always had the worst-case scenario in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she has always been acting like this, she probably never realized that all the negativity was just unnecessary worry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let’s get married.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I swear I’ll be together with you for the rest of your life. This way, you won’t need to worry about us breaking up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;W-We can’t get married at this age.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s get engaged first then. We can get married after we’re old enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after I said all that, she still looked hesitant. I’m getting irritated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina! Stop brooding over this!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But… I don’t have the confidence that I’ll make you happy…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then try it! You won’t get anywhere if you don’t at least try it! Listen to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath. What I’m going to say will sound pathetic, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will make me happy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words startled Shiina as she blinked her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why don’t just leave me to someone else! Tell yourself that you can do this! Don’t throw me away without even trying! Shiina Mai. I’m confident that you can make me happy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what the hell I was saying to her, but at least it seemed like my words got through to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try…” She mumbled while looking at her palm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Maybe we won’t be able to live normally like normal people because of our previous lives’ memories. Maybe we’re horrible at trying to reach for our happiness, but that’s exactly why we’ll be perfect for each other. I promise I’ll make you happy, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I can make you happy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the memories of my previous life came to my mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It can’t be helped then. Let’s live our unhappy life together.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She once said that to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I couldn’t accept those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Living our unhappy life together? No way, I should be the only one who lives an unhappy life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what I swore during that day. But, it turned out that what the witch said back then was correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can we really do it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In our previous lives, Grey Handlet and Cerys Flores lived our unhappy lives together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time, as Shiraishi Godou and Shiina Mai, everything will be different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not a hero like in my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I’ll live my life more arrogantly back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll get what I want.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll do whatever I want to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since what I want is her happiness, I’ll do my best to make her happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I reached out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s live our happy life together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as her laughter, came her tears. She had a rather pathetic look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pretty face was ruined as her eyes turned swollen and tears ran down her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite that, she wiped her tears away and took my hands with a determined look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled my hand and hugged me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oi, my clothes are still wet from the rain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sweet scent tickled my nostrils.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her warmth chased the cold away from my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’ll make you happy, Godou.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that in a whisper. Strength filled the hands that embraced me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll make you happy too. This time as a lover.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How long has it been since Shiina and I started hugging?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably less than a minute, but in that short amount of time, my whole being was filled with happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, such feelings didn’t last.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since everything was resolved, I gradually regained my composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…So, when should we separate?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina was holding on to me so tightly that I couldn’t even see her face. It seemed like she wouldn’t let go of me anytime soon. If anything, this girl had been rubbing her cheeks against my chest for a while now. Why is she so cute? I just can’t…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, that aside, even though there was no one around, we were still in public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the Government’s Office, we sure made a big mess here…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We bickered with each other loudly, shouting our love to each other and to top it all, we hugged each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone were to see us, it would be a disaster for us…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, can I have a minute?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone called me from behind. In an instant, my whole body trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I’d be able to notice their footsteps, but I was too distracted to pay any attention to my surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly turned around and moved away from Shiina. Behind me was the security guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to interrupt you two, but it&#8217;s closing time already…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes… S-Sorry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us cowered in shame. I could feel my face getting even hotter than back when I was shouting my love for Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell were we doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be, don’t be. I got to see something good thanks to you two. Ah, youth…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The security guard nodded his head a few times. The warm gaze he sent us stung.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even have the energy to make commentary on his gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m glad there are no other people here or else I’d need to stop you in the middle. Now, that would be awkward, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the security guard as he escorted us to the elevator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I wish you two happiness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sent us off with a smile as we entered the elevator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stood side by side as the elevator slowly descended to the lowest floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Shiina, who was standing next to me, only to find that she was also glancing at me. At that moment, our eyes met. For some reason, I turned my gaze away. After a while, I turned my gaze on her again and our eyes met again. This time, Shiina was the one who turned her gaze away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should we do now? This is so awkward…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, did this mean that we had officially become lovers?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How do you do this whole lovers thing again? Ugh, I didn’t know a single thing about this!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, just being next to her already made me nervous…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But still… We were dating, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the elevator reached the ground level, the door opened. My legs were still frozen, but Shiina took my hand and urged me to leave with her, hand in hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shiina?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-This much should be fine… W-We’re lovers anyway…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away, but her hand was still firmly grasping mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though our gazes were apart, our hands were tied to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Godou?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my silence, she turned her gaze toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you embarrassed by this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said, trying to tease me, even though her face was as red as mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re so cute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a giggle that turned into a seductive smile a beat later. This was a new side of her that I never knew existed. Before this, it was me who kept teasing her all the time, but now that we’ve become lovers, the dynamic in our relationship seemed to be reversed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No, that shouldn’t be the case. She was as hopeless as I do in regard to romance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I could tease her back, I should be able to keep my dignity as the man in our relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shiina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her, but she made a move quickly and placed a finger on my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Am I not your girlfriend? Call me by my name.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did that mean she wanted me to call her ‘Mai’?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I suddenly felt embarrassed. Maybe it was because I was too used to calling her ‘Shiina’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She called me ‘Godou’ as soon as I told her to stop calling me ‘Hero’, so she was used to this. I probably should have called her ‘Mai’ when I decided to stop calling her ‘Witch.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only I had done that, I wouldn’t be stuck in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;M-Mai…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called Shiina— Mai, by her name, she giggled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say it one more time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aren’t we lovers?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop giving me those puppy eyes! I wanted to say that, but I couldn’t!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called her name again, she leaned her head against my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She unclasped my hand and repositioned herself so that she could embrace my arm instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This position was too dangerous. I could feel her soft chest on my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were so reluctant, but you sure got in the mood quickly…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard that, she puffed both her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been putting up with this feeling for a long time, so I have to do at least this much to make up for it. Since you said that I don’t need to restrain myself, I’ll do my best to shower you with my love…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was bad for my heart, but at the same time, it made me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked home together under the night sky. The rain had long gone. The clouds had gone away somewhere as the night sky was filled with countless shining stars. My clothes were still damp, so the air felt a little chilly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I could feel the warmth of summer, the chilly air reminded me that autumn was fast approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Mai spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take care of me from now on, Darling~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Darling?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t we getting married later?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah, but you know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was too early for this!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I think so, my mind managed to imagine my newlywed life with her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Welcome home, darling~ Would you like your dinner? A bath? Or maybe…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes please, call me darling, please. Let’s get married right now!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just kidding. We’ll use that after we get married for real. For now, let’s act appropriately as lovers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh… I-I see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Did you really think that I’ll call you ‘Darling’ all the time while we’re still lovers?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right. I took her joke too seriously, jeez, what a pathetic guy I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, you’re going to propose to me again later, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Do I have to?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I will never get tired of your proposals, it’s like good food, you know? One will never get tired of good food, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If possible, I really didn’t want to do that nerve-wracking confession ever again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if that could make her happy…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up at the sky and saw a twinkling shooting star. Before its light disappeared, I prayed in my heart.</span></p>

<p><b>May we live a happy life in the future.</b></p>
