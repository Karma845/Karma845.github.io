<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; How to Be Social, Fireworks Festival</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>1</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a shift today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started to regret taking too many shifts during this lovely summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to sigh like that, it’s a rare sight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki, who was washing the dishes next to me, stared at me with a serious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you were like a machine built for working.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a human being, thank you very much. I could get into a mood like this sometimes too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s new to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you look so surprised?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d understand if someone were to react like this to my previous life’s self, but I wasn’t like that anymore!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, back then, I was a subject of human experiment, so it was doubtful that I was a human in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, one could call me a human, depending on their views on the definition of a human being. Wait, I’m getting too philosophical.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about this nonsense, Kawasaki called out to me. It seemed like she noticed something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be… Did you get rejected, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How the hell did you come to that conclusion?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swear to god, I was just feeling a little under the weather.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s summer. Summer is the season for blooming love!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so you’ve watched that one movie.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! I’m weak against that kind of emotional movie—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she proceeded to talk about the movie that was airing in the theater with a twinkle in her eyes. I gave an ear to her while doing my job. There were barely any customers here, so we had the leisure to chat idly like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, listen to me, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am, I am. So that one guy got dumped by a girl for some reason and then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t leave out the details! The details are important!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki started to complain while puffing out her cheeks. Her gesture looked flawless, but I knew that she did it consciously. Since I was used to Shiina doing the same thing, though that girl did it unconsciously, Kawasaki’s gesture had no effect on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a smug look, but Kawasaki ignored it and said something else to me,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, by the way, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I remember you said that you aren’t really interested in romance movies, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than not interested in them, I just didn’t understand them when I watched them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I didn’t know what being in love felt like, so I couldn’t relate to those movies at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, I think I’d find those movies a little bit interesting now. I mean, I understand a little about love, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, I knew that I loved Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I wasn’t a hundred percent sure that I really loved her. I had never fallen in love with anyone, so I couldn’t really tell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I wanted to make sure that I really loved her before confessing. Besides, if I were to confess to her now, I doubt that I&#8217;d be able to say the words properly to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you ever been in love, Kawasaki?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, she stopped working and stared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her face closely. She had a well-defined face. With a face like that, she was definitely a popular girl. If so, she&#8217;d be bound to be experienced with love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. Back in grade school, I liked this classmate of mine who was really good at soccer. Then, back in middle school, there was a quiet boy who I took a liking to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both are different types of people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The person I fell in love with became the type of person that I like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words were shallow, but at the same time, it felt deep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what happened to them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got disillusioned and my love just disappeared. Takahashi-kun, the boy who was really good at soccer, had no delicacy. Hoshino-kun, the quiet boy, was a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> who just tried to look cool.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s how it is. I fell in love and fell out of it on my own. Such is love~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was that how love worked?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was Kawasaki who said it, so it must be right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I nodded my head, she suddenly spoke in a quieter voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My love is always faint. It never grew too big, so it cooled off quickly. I don’t think I’m the right person to ask about something like this. I mean, I’m still looking for that one special person myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She spoke to me in a serious manner, which was rare for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was just an idle question, you know? I-It isn’t like I’m looking for advice or anything…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, do you know that you’re an easy person to read?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like everyone could tell what I was thinking about these days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was as perceptive as Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That one special person, huh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Shiina’s face came to my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Huh? Why did her face come up in this situation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started to be flustered because of my thoughts. Suddenly, Kawasaki let out a sad smile at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was hoping that it would work out this time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Did she have someone in mind already?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to ask her what she meant by that, she shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind me. My feeling is just a crush. I can’t win no matter how hard I try.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She continued and changed the topic,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, who did you fall in love with, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because this isn’t something that you’d normally ask.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she asked with twinkling eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me, tell me. Who is she? Is she going to the same school as us? Is she pretty? What’s her name? I’m curious! Since you fell in love with her, is she a weirdo like you, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Stop with the barrage of questions! W-Well, it’s true that she is a weirdo…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to answer them, I faltered instead. My reaction triggered something in Kawasaki as she smirked while saying, “Woah, you actually fell in love with someone~”. Seriously, what’s wrong with her?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There aren’t many people who&#8217;re as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">pure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> as you nowadays, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">senpai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;S-Shut up. She’s my first love, okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, I see. No wonder you’re acting like this. C’mon, stop sulking~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled, trying to cheer me up. It made me wonder who was the older one between us. If I were to count my previous life, I would be significantly older than her…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Her name is Shiina Mai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, she nodded in understanding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, the transfer student. The boys in my year talked about how cute she is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that Shiina was cute. Whenever she walked down the street, everyone would steal glances at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I wasn’t really surprised to hear that the first-years were talking about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I were to compare her to the ‘idols’, she would be among the better looking ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I was sure that men would be all over her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I didn’t want anyone to take her away from me. I wonder if this is what they call possessiveness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought that I didn’t need to be in a hurry, but looking at the situation, I realized that I couldn’t take it easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kawasaki, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to know if I really love her. Just to be sure, you know? Since you know a lot about love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How could you say that embarrassing line.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked unusually embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-Besides, I never had a boyfriend to begin with, so it isn’t like I know a lot about the matter either. But, sure, if you really need this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">onee-san</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’s help, I’ll gladly help you~ Come closer~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She puffed out her chest. What a dependable girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure about referring to herself as an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘onee-san</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’, but I knew that she was more experienced than me in this regard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I was a newcomer in this battle, I knew nothing about it. I had no techniques nor confidence to tread on it. That was why I’d welcome any kind of help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I told her about my feelings toward Shiina and what I had been through up to the time when I realized my feelings toward her. Of course, I omitted the part about our previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s the gist of it— Huh, what’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at Kawasaki, she was hiding her face with both hands. For some reason her ears were dyed red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Why don’t you try putting yourself in my shoes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She fanned her face for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like her so much that you end up thinking about her all the time? What the hell?! If that isn’t love then what is?! What are you so confused about?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s obvious that you’re in love.” muttered Kawasaki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see… Honestly, I didn’t know the difference between liking and loving someone. Well, if Kawasaki said that my feeling was love, then it must be it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what should I do now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just ask her out already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she said, but I didn’t even know where to begin. In the first place, I didn’t even understand the concept of ‘going out’. I knew that it was necessary to make me and Shiina become even closer, but that was it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I don’t know where to start…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, from what I understood, you two are on good terms already, so it should be easy. All you need to do is to make her conscious about you. To do that… Try asking her on a date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“J-Just the two of us? That would be embarrassing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you even embarrassed over this?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to imagine the scene where I asked Shiina out on a date, I suddenly got cold feet. Yes, we were on good terms, but she could still reject me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if I screwed it up and she still treated me as a friend after everything was over? Just thinking about that made me feel embarrassed to the point that I almost rolled on the floor. Lucky that I still held on to my sanity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-Besides… I don’t know what to do for a date…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I just do the same thing as when I hang out with my friends?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that was allowed, then it would be easy, but I doubt that our relationship could progress like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Kawasaki seemed like she got a flash of inspiration as she tapped her palm with her fist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right! There’s a firework festival this weekend! Try to invite her to that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, she was right. There will be a firework festival this Saturday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I planned to go with Hina like usual this year, but I should do what Kawasaki suggested instead. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Shiina liked pretty things, she’d definitely love fireworks too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Though, she hates the crowds. I guess I’d need some time to convince her first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. I’ll try doing that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded, Kawasaki quickly spoke,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Later, when the mood is good, make sure to hold her hand tightly. If she doesn’t mind, you could drag her to a secluded place and hug each other there. After that, bring her to a hotel and–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki let out a creepy laugh as she went on with her fantasy. I noticed the manager approaching us, so I quietly went back to work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about at work?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If there are no customers to take care of, follow what Shiraishi is doing and clean up the place!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kawasaki stared at me with a resentful gaze as she responded to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew nothing about love, but even I knew that your fantasy was too far-fetched, Kawasaki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I wonder what he is doing right now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever I let my mind wander around like this, I always ended up thinking about Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou…” I muttered his name. Somehow, it felt embarrassing when I did that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to call him ‘Hero’, but he insisted that he wasn’t a hero anymore, so I called him by his name instead. I knew it was too late to mull over this, but I still didn’t know why I called him ‘Godou’ instead of ‘Shiraishi.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that didn’t really matter as I felt comfortable calling him &#8216;Godou’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…On the contrary, I felt miffed that he kept calling me ‘Shiina’. It was better than him calling me ‘Witch’ at least, but, you know…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called him ‘Godou’, so he should start calling me ‘Mai’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Wait, did that even make sense? Calm down, me! It felt unfair, yes, but I shouldn’t think about something like that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I imagined Godou calling me by my name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hng!!~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a strange moan and rolled on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I took one of my plushies and hugged it tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trip to the pool was fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t swim, so I just spent my time floating around with a floatie, but with Godou and everyone there, there was never a dull moment. Being around with friends that I could trust felt fun and refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Though, I didn’t feel happy enough to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt the muscles on my face relaxed as I remembered Godou’s silly looking crying face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, I felt something strange happening in me. My heart would throb without warning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was I sick?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, of course not. It was probably the ‘curse’ that was eating away my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled the face of the person who ‘cursed’ me, Godou. Whenever I tried to think about him, my mind went blank involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since that day…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day when he asked me to be his friend…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our relationship grew strange. Whenever I made eye contact with him, I’d involuntarily look away. Whenever I stayed together with him, my cheeks would grow hotter and I’d become fidgety. For some reason, I’d find myself staring at him without realizing it. Was this the side effect of friendship?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that’s so, then friendship is amazing. It made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to see him again. When would we be able to meet again?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was ‘cursed’, I found the cure to it already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time in my life, I felt blessed even though I was ‘cursed’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was rolling in my bed while thinking about such things, my phone rang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately stood up and grabbed it, thinking that it was from Godou. Sadly, it wasn’t. I wasn’t disappointed by it much, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kirishima-san who called me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath before answering it. A cheerful voice came from the other side.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Ah, heya, Mai-chan~ How are you?~}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m good… I-It’s just, it’s so hot outside, so I have been staying inside my room…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since the trip to the pool, I’ve been trying to talk to them more casually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I unintentionally shifted to my normal tone back when I denied being an airhead, both Kirishima-san and Shindou-san welcomed it with excitement. That was why I had been trying to treat them more casually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It felt like I became even closer to them. It felt good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still felt nervous about treating everyone casually like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was feeling conflicted, I heard Kirishima-san’s voice.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Ahaha, I feel you! Honestly, if I didn’t have club activities, I’d do the same as you!}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she went to her club today too. Kirishima-san sure was amazing. If I were her, I wouldn’t even attempt to run in the middle of this kind of heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I would have fainted the moment I attempted to do so.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Right, Mai-chan, you like novels, right? Have you read that one novel yet? The one that’s trending right now?}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What novel was she talking about? She didn’t mention the title at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a wild guess and mentioned a popular title that was trending because it got a live action adaptation. It seemed like my guess was correct. Actually, that one was one of my favorite titles of all time. Even though I mostly read light novels these days, I usually read that kind of book too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Romance was one of my favorite genres. I always found myself looking for one whenever I went to a bookstore.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{You know the movie is currently airing, right? So, Yuuka and I were talking about watching it together. Do you want to go with us?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! I-I’d love to!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered that, I could hear her excited squeal from the other side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, Kirishima-san has been calling me like this to invite me to hang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By chance, did she like me? If so, I’d be so happy!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I consider her as my friend? I wonder if she’d mind me as her friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only she’d tell me outright like Godou did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, you didn’t normally say this thing out loud, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what Godou told me anyway. Unlike me, he had a lot of friends, so he should know a lot about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh right, I should ask Kirishima-san about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Will you invite Godou and Kudou-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Ah… Well, they don’t really like romance movies. Even if we invite them, they’ll just refuse. I haven’t asked Godou yet, Yuuka hasn&#8217;t asked Shinji too, I assume.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking forward to watching the movie since I liked the novel. But I felt a little disappointed because Godou wouldn’t be there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, back in his previous life, he said that he didn’t really understand love stories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though love was a beautiful emotion. It was a shame that he couldn’t understand the feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Then again, I’ve never fallen in love either, so I didn’t really understand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Godou’s face came to my mind. I shook my head frantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W-What am I thinking?! He’s just a friend!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, even though we were friends, we were enemies back in our previous life. There was no way that he’d think of me like that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;What’s wrong?}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was making such excuses in my head, Kirishima-san called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nothing. Don’t mind me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I do something strange? Kirishima-san went quiet for a while…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Anyway, do you want to meet up now? I just got back from my club.}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agreed to meet up with her. Unlike her or Godou, I had no club activities or part-time job, so I had a lot of free time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left my house and walked to a park a short distance away. There, I found Kirishima-san sitting on a bench under the shade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, her club’s uniform. There was a towel draped around her neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan!~ You look cute today too! Yay~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she noticed me, she raised her hand in high spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed suit and raised a hand. In response, she immediately clapped my hand with hers. It seemed I made the right response. It was the first time that I had ever done a high-five. Somehow, it felt moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She, then, patted the empty space next to her. I obediently sat there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her up close like this, I realized once again that she was really pretty and stylish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a large pair of breasts, thin legs and waist. Overall, she beat me in every aspect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her personality was bright, cheerful and kind. I wanted to be someone like her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s another hot day, today. Ah, don’t get too close to me, I’m covered in sweat, so I don’t think I’ll smell that good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was trying to sneak closer to her, but it seemed like she noticed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gulped the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">cider</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> she bought from the vending machine. How should I put it? She looked a little erotic? …Wait, what the hell was I thinking? Calm down! (T/N: Cider here is a brand of lemonade, not alcohol.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, why did she call me out here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she just wanted to see me? If that so, that would be blissful for me. Hehe~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to talk about the schedule for watching the movie. I know we could talk it over the phone, but since I was nearby anyway, I figured I could just call you out instead. Sorry if it inconveniences you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, not at all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She clapped her hands together with an apologetic look. I shook my head in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we checked on the movie’s schedule and decided on a date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Shindou-san and I were free during the vacation, we only needed to adjust to Kirishima-san’s schedule. After figuring out the days when she didn’t have her club activities, we decided on a date easily. I’m really looking forward to the day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about the movie, I noticed Kirishima-san smiling happily while looking at her phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head in confusion. Noticing that, she apologized to me before showing me her phone screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a RINE from Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I tried to invite him to watch the movie. Surprisingly, he said that he was interested.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…That means Godou will be coming too? Oh no, what should I wear then? I couldn’t wear the same dress I used the other day, could I? I should wear some cute clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started racking my brain, but suddenly Godou’s next response came and doused all my excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ah, but I have a shift on that day.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, jeez.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that, Kirishima-san looked totally unamused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood her. I was a fool for being so happy. My shoulders slumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, both of them tried to work on a schedule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh… I don’t think this will work out. Let’s just go with the three of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the end result. It seemed like everyone was quite busy during the summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, those two communicated casually like this all the time, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…How envious. The figures of both of them walking together came to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were perfect for each other. Anyone could see that Kirishima-san was so pretty that one could mistake her as an idol easily. Meanwhile Godou, although I hated to admit it, he was the coolest guy in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, they had known each other since their childhood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was deep into my thoughts, Kirishima-san called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nothing. I-It’s just, you and Godou seem to be getting along really well, Kirishima-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;From my perspective, you get along better with him, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and him? Was that really the case?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that we got closer than before ever since we reconciled, but our relationship was incomparable to his relationship with Kirishima-san. I mean, we argued a lot still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai-chan, what do you think of Godou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t come up with an answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do I think of him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I don’t know. I don’t even know why I don’t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in our previous lives, we were enemies, but now we’re friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was the one who saved me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He taught me what happiness looked like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was my hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever I was with him, I felt nervous, but at the same time, I felt happy. Whenever I looked at him, I realized that he was the coolest guy in the world. Whenever he found me doing something silly, even though he would laugh at me, his smile made me very happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Words couldn’t describe the feelings I had toward him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seemed like Kirishima-san understood my feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan, you look like a maiden-in-love, do you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I froze for a moment, not knowing what she meant by that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she pulled out a hand mirror and pointed it at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mirror reflected my face, which was bright red from the base of my neck to the tips of my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It was exactly the kind of expression a heroine would make whenever she was thinking about the hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You love Godou, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she asked me without any pretense like that, I couldn’t make any excuse to deny it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this time, I pretended not to notice what this feeling was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I knew what exactly this feeling was. The feeling that had been occupying my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of wanting to meet him, the feeling of yearning for his touch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted him to hold me close, to kiss me with his lips again…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be his lover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kirishima-san confronted me boldly like that, the chain that had been keeping this feeling in check broke down to pieces. With that, realization came to me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m disappointed in myself.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t admit this feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to do it, I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Godou asked me to be his friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He reached out to me to start a new relationship with me. A relationship filled with warmth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to ask for something more, I would be betraying him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou wouldn’t say anything, but I knew that he’d be annoyed if he were to know about my feelings. That was why, it would be better for me to keep this feeling to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I shook my head and denied my feelings. That was the only option available to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way that I’d fall in love with him…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Kirishima-san shut her mouth for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My gaze was facing downward, so I didn’t know what kind of face she was making.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably felt uncomfortable since my tone came off strongly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. Sorry for asking you a strange question.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She apologized in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too. Sorry, I didn’t mean to deny it strongly like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, don’t be. I’m at fault here. Prying into people’s feelings is just the worst thing someone could do…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s cheerful atmosphere was gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to cheer her up, but with my lack of social skills, I didn’t know how to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I apologized to her, thinking that it’d make her feel better. But, her cheerful smile never returned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, that’s all. See you at the theater, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled weakly and walked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t say anything to stop her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Godou’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I finished my part-time job, the sun had already set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was 8pm, but it seemed like it didn’t want to linger around any longer, even though it was supposed to be the summer sun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cool breeze ruffled my hair. Only on summer nights like this would I appreciate the strength of Gunma’s wind. Unlike on summer days where it only made the day hotter as it blew the hot air around, on summer nights it blew the cool breeze around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was holding a leaflet in my hand, a notice for the upcoming firework festival. A while ago, right before I left the store, Kawasaki gave it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maebashi Firework Festival. They held it every year in Shikishima Park and I always went to see it together with Hina. It would take me twenty minutes by bike to get there from my house and thirty minutes by bike to get there from Shiina’s place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They will hold it next Saturday, August 13th.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a perfect excuse to ask Shiina for a date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I saw her just the other day during the pool trip, I couldn’t wait to see her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During this summer vacation, I didn’t get to see her much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I saw her occasionally because I had to treat her curse, but that wasn’t enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to see her everyday if possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I miss school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I said that, but I’d probably be embarrassed if I were to be with her on our own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Alright…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my phone and opened up my RINE. I opened my chat screen with Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, how should I invite her? Should I just drop the subject without beating around the bush? It was the first time I’ve ever felt conflicted when trying to send her a message. Usually, I’d just state my business clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after racking my brain for a while, I failed to find a way to ask her out. You know what? Whatever, I should just call her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let momentum carry me and called her. Almost immediately, she answered my call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Heya.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;Hello. What’s wrong?}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her calm voice reached my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just want to ask you something. Are you free next saturday?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Next saturday? Well, yeah. Actually, I’m always free.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I-I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how to feel after hearing that response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I should cut to the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re free, let’s go to the firework festival together.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Firework festival? …Ah, come to think of it, it’s that time of the year already.}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Shiina. After that, there was a short silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she still contemplating? Was the thought about being in the crowds intimidating her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The few seconds of silence felt longer than it actually was.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Who else are you inviting?}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a bit of courage for me to answer her question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No one. I want to go with you only.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will she realize the meaning of those words?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably won’t. I mean, this was Shiina, someone who had communication disorder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because I felt really nervous, I felt unusually thirsty. I sipped the tea in my hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Only us two? …A-Are you asking me out on a date?!}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost spit out my tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Contrary to my expectations, she realized it almost immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Well, you could put it that way…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t think of a proper response. My state of mind was in chaos.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{O-Okay… S-Sorry, I misunderstood your intentions…}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She apologized for some reason. Even though she didn’t misunderstand anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really was asking her out on a date. I wanted to be with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to say those words to her so badly, but I could only give ambiguous affirmation to her words.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I-I see it’s all good then… A-Alright, I’ll go with you…}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was great that she agreed to go with me, but part of her words gave me a sense of discomfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, I didn’t have enough courage to point it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we decided on the time and place for us to meet up and said goodbyes to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, see you later.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I’m looking forward to it.}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina’s voice, which had been sounding so happy, suddenly turned monotonous.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{We’ll be staying as friends, right?}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like I was being stabbed by countless nails.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this was Shiina, there was no way she’d use that roundabout way to reject my advances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still have a chance. For sure.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>3</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day of the firework festival came before I knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My shift ended at 3pm. I was absent-minded all day long to the point that Kawasaki was amazed that I managed to get through the day without any accident. I had trouble deciding what to wear for the festival, but ultimately settled on a normal shirt and jeans. I was thinking of wearing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">jinbei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, but I figured that Shiina probably wouldn’t wear a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. (T/N: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jinbei</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a Japanese’s traditional summer clothing. The top looks like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kimono</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, but the bottom is a pair of trousers instead.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, she’d probably go to the festival by bike, so it would be impossible for her to pedal it if she were to wear a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The girls who went to the festival wearing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> usually came with their parents’ vehicles, but Shiina was living alone, so that wasn’t an option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to mention that the location of the park was quite awkward since there was no train station nearby, so she wouldn’t be coming by train.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was still an hour before the promised time, but I couldn’t wait any longer, so I took my bike and left my house. It was sunny today, but the current temperature wasn’t as hot as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to meet up in a coffee shop near the park where the festival would be held.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The closer I got to my destination, the more crowded the street became.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t like being in the crowds much, but I didn’t really hate this bustling atmosphere either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, I arrived at the coffee shop thirty minutes before the appointed time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived way too early, I know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should buy a coffee or something while waiting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought so, I heard a trotting sound coming from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I saw someone wearing a bright red </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello. You’re early.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She styled her hair differently than usual. It was curled up and was being held by a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kanzashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. (T/N: A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kanzashi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">is a traditional hairpin.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a faint smile on her lips. Her face looked prettier than usual because of her makeup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything about her looked so refreshing that I let out my true feelings involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Man, you look so cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Eh?!&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a blink of an eye, her face turned red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked even cuter. I can’t… I’m barely hanging…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, whatever thing that she’d do, she’d always look cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might have defeated her in my previous life, but she completely owned me in this life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Stop joking around! L-Let’s just go inside!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not joking though… Anyway, if you came here earlier than me, you shoulda wait for me inside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just arrived. I thought I got here too early, but there you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at my face and giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she look so relaxed?! I felt so nervous, it was killing me!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s strange. I was supposed to be the one watching over her stumbling around like a fool, but why was I the one who was stumbling around like a fool instead?! Was it the after-effect of my love for her?!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, how did you get here? You didn’t ride a bike while wearing that, did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I have to hide my current state of mind from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Taxi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh right. She was filthy rich!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It slipped my mind that she could just call a taxi instead. I wonder how much money she had to spend for that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t normally ride a taxi, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nice riding it once in a while”, she continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, you have to, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It’s too far to get here by walking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could just wear normal clothes and come here by bike, why did she insist on wearing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe because I was staring at her for a long time, she glanced downward to look at her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do I look weird?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I just said that you look cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;R-Right, you did. S-Sorry, it’s my first time wearing a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why were you wearing it anyway? I mean, I’m happy to see you in it, but, you know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh cr*p, I slipped up again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You’re happy? I-I see… T-Thank you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered shyly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my cheeks heated up. No good, I need to be more careful. I can’t let my true feelings come out again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Anyway, I looked up ‘how to enjoy fireworks festival with your friends’, and they said that I have to wear a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, so I prepared one in a hurry… Was I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No… You don’t really have to wear it, but there are a lot of people who do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We managed to find empty seats inside the crowded coffee shop while talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place was cool because it had AC inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ordered an iced coffee and Shiina ordered an apple tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my iced coffee arrived, I sipped it. It tasted bitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina looked at me in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You drink it black?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I prefer black.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to enjoy adding more sugar to my coffee, but these days, I found that the coffee tasted better without any sugar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t really like bitter stuff like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Even back in your previous life, you just ate sweet things.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We managed to have a pleasant conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at the clock and realized that there was still time before the festival started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could kill some time at the stalls outside, but considering Shiina’s weak stamina, it would be better for us to stay here instead. I mean, that was the reason why we decided on this place as the meeting place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, we could try to meet up right before the festival started, but, you know…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to see her sooner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to spend more time together with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s great that it’s sunny today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know, right? I bet the fireworks will look pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we soon ran out of topics and fell into silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We ended up finishing our drinks really quickly because we used them to cover up the awkwardness. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oi, that girl over there looks really cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, is she an idol?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of the silence, I could hear the voice of the girls chatting from a distance away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at that girl, she looks really cute…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should try to hit on her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you think you should focus on your girlfriend sitting in front of you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear the conversation of the couple sitting two seats away from us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from those, I felt countless gazes at us. Shiina seemed to also notice this as she let out a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are they talking about me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how insecure Shiina was about herself, when people clearly showed their interest in her like this, she was bound to notice it. Well, she was the cutest girl in the world, so it was obvious that she’d stand out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not used to receiving this kind of gaze…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If only they’d scorn me instead, that’d make me feel more comfortable…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s new to me. I thought you’d love this kind of gaze.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, when they look at me like that, it feels like they’re placing a lot of expectations on me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know about that&#8230; She looked at me and smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I understand what you went through back then…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, so she was talking about that. I understand where she was coming from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in my previous life, the gazes the people sent me were filled with expectations. It was suffocating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If the gazes are filled with scorn, I don’t need to worry about anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, I think she just felt numb to it at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normal people wouldn’t feel good by being scorned by others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember that no one in this world wants to hurt you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Well, even so, people have their likes and dislikes. Maybe there are people who secretly hate me, they just aren’t here at this moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, everyone I’ve met so far has been kind…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have to cherish them well, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she cherished them, they’d also cherish her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, she stared at me blankly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Well, after experiencing their warmth, it’s hard to let go of them… It made me feel like I don&#8217;t want to be alone anymore…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a soft smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I won’t let you be alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? …Will you be friends with me forever, then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t nod to that. I didn’t want us to stay friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like I said, I will never let you be alone ever again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I repeated my words instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a promise?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes, I promise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and offered my pinky to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She, then, intertwined her pinky with mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a pinky promise”, I said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she muttered,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If you break the promise, I’ll curse you to burn forever in hell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that punishment too severe?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that, but honestly, I think that it was too light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m kidding. I should be the only one who’ll burn forever in hell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t let that happen. I’ll drag you up to heaven with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Ahem…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a cough to clear the awkward atmosphere and pulled back my pinky finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doing Japan-esque things like this was proof that we had gotten used to living in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Shiina opened her mouth. As if she understood what was in my mind, she said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, this much should be fine. We’re still high school students, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we left the coffee shop, the sky was dyed in orange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun would set soon and more people came to crowd the streets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked alongside Shiina to the site of the fireworks festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were food stalls lined up on the streets near the riverbed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lanterns illuminated the street, accompanying the people passing by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This place is so crowded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to go home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Being in the crowds once in a while doesn’t feel bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Once in a while, huh? Come to think of it, the other day, the pool was quite crowded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably being considerate to me. I should invite her to a quieter place next time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about that, she asked me a question,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m looking forward to seeing the fireworks. When will they start?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… A while longer, I think. Let’s grab something from the stalls to kill some time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m quite hungry”, I added while rubbing my stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she was wearing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">geta</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and it was quite hard to walk while wearing it, I slowed down my walking pace. (T/N: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Geta</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> are basically flip-flops, but they were made of wood and they had heels.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked around, I noticed there were more couples than I originally thought here. Of course, families or students walking in groups could be seen here and there but, compared to them, the number of couples was simply bigger. They were quite noticeable because they were walking while holding each other’s hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I looked at Shiina’s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her small hand was free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, we aren’t dating yet! It’s too soon to take that hand!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calm down, me! Drive the sinful thoughts away!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never gone to this kind of festival with a friend before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Shiina was walking happily. If I were to leave her alone, she’d probably start skipping her steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…With a friend, huh? I was the one who told her to be my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, I screwed myself up. I shoulda asked her to be my girlfriend instead back then! Who knows if she’d nodded because of the atmosphere at the time!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I want those! Cotton candies!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She excitedly bought a big cotton candy at one of the stalls. Her eyes sparkled at the sight of it. The middle aged man who manned the stall looked at her warmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is she, a grade schooler? Well, I’m not mean enough to say it to her face when she is this happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She licked the cotton candy. How could she look cute while doing it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she was struggling because of the sheer size of the thing. Nevertheless, she looked like she was enjoying herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So tasty! It’s so sweet!~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it’s sweet. It’s a lump of sugar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right… W-Will I get fat from eating this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just enjoy it, don’t worry about it. It’s fine for you to get a little fatter anyway, besides—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost said ‘You’ll look cute either way’ to her, but I managed to hold myself back at the last moment. I kept repeating myself, but she was really cute today. It felt embarrassing to say it out loud over and over again, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She waited for me to continue my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Never mind…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to dismiss it, she looked a little miffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I get fatter, my good looks will be gone, I know that much, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’re aware that you’re cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shut it! Everyone keeps telling me that I’m cute, so I can’t help but accept it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called her cute again. Her face turned bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, I need to stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anymore of this or I’ll die out of embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Anyway, I’m hungry. I should grab something too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll get some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yakisoba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered. Shiina, then, turned her head around to look at the various stalls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">okonomiyaki</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re going to eat more? You’ll get fat for real.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way cotton candy is enough to fill my stomach!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina groaned before going to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">okonomiyaki</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> stall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I parted with her to buy my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yakisoba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> before going back to her side again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where shall we eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since everything is about to start, we should look for a decent place to see the fireworks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of people already occupied the grassy patches on the side of the streets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I brought a sheet with me, I just needed to look for an empty spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking toward a less crowded place, Shiina stopped me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed Shiina’s gaze, only to find Shinji and Yuuka there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were so close to each other. Rather, they were practically clinging to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka noticed us and immediately pulled away from Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You guys are here too? W-What a coincidence!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Yuuka with a bright red face. Her eyes wandered around like a guilty criminal. She needs to calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Shinji just shrugged his shoulders calmly at the sight. How could this one be so calm?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hello.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina bowed as she greeted them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After looking at both of them alternatively, she tilted her head slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you two going out?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blunt and direct question that completely ignored Yuuka’s efforts to hide everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Ahaha… We aren’t going out… Yet…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ‘yet’ part was said in a small voice. That sounded cute, actually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asked Shinji teasingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, after seeing what they did it was hard to believe that they weren’t dating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka desperately tried to cover his mouth, but he managed to dodge her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The usual exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Yuuka cleared her throat and tried to change the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway! You look cute in that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Mai-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shoulda worn a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> too. I want to take some pictures with you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to wear a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yukata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to do that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina pulled up her phone and opened her camera.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka smiled when seeing that and both of them proceeded to take some selfies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Shinji and I were busy admiring both of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, since when? I’ve noticed you two got along better recently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since the start of the summer vacation. She had been liking me for a while and she just got the courage to confess to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His smug attitude was typical of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was true that Yuuka had been liking him for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;And she said that you aren’t together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s true. I haven’t given her an answer yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yet you flirted with her out in the open like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to reply to her tonight. I gave it a lot of thought and I figured that I like her, so yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had an unusually serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His serious expression made him look cool. He rarely showed his serious face like this, what a waste of his good looks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s Hina? Don’t you normally go with her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I invited Shiina instead. Well, I told Hina about it, but she said that she wanted to go with her friends today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I always went with Hina, I felt the need to tell her. But, it seemed like it was unnecessary since she planned to go with her friends anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I was being too self-conscious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me to do my best tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she noticed what I was trying to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji leaned his body on the fence at the side of the street with a bottle of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramune</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He popped the bottle open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I somehow knew what he was trying to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I became aware of what love was, I became aware of the feelings that Hina directed toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t think that she was being truthful when she said that, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I noticed that she was faking her smile.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to have practiced making a fake smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You like Shiina Mai, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He nodded, before glancing toward the night sky while sipping his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramune</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun had long since gone from the sky. The night sky was filled with stars.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, I’m not going to say anything else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He left my side and joined up with Yuuka, who was playing with Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go. The fireworks are about to start.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-E-Eh? W-Wait…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He casually embraced her by the shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka stiffened up by his actions, meanwhile Shiina’s face reddened after she saw this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See ya, Godou, Shiina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Shinji dismissed both reactions and left with Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka, who normally would scold Shinji, seemed to be letting him do whatever he wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina watched their departed backs with interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I just saw something amazing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if it’s those two, it was just a matter of time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Really? …I-I didn’t notice that they had such things going on…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it hadn’t been long since she moved here, so of course she wouldn’t notice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, he is right, the fireworks are about to start.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We rushed to find an empty spot on the grass patches and laid down a sheet on it. Perhaps because our sheet wasn’t too wide, our shoulders were touching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While eating my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yakisoba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I glanced at Shiina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was blowing on her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">okonomiyaki</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cool it down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she noticed my gaze, she turned her face away and said, “Could you not stare at me too much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I obeyed her and focused on my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yakisoba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> instead. After a while, I noticed she was staring at me, so I stared back at her. When our eyes met, she averted her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared at her longer. Then, she stared back again, and turned her face away again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell are we doing? Well, this felt comfortable, so I didn’t mind this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the bustling atmosphere around us felt surprisingly comfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We didn’t talk, but it felt fulfilling, somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she finished her food, Shiina drank the green tea she bought from the vending machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently placed my hand on her other hand that was laying on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensing my touch, her shoulders trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she looked at me timidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-W-W-What? W-What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good question. I don’t know what am I doing too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Um… You know, the curse’s treatment? I-I thought of doing it right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But isn’t it hard to concentrate in a place like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The excuse I managed to find was shot down with her unusually logical argument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I didn’t move my hand away and neither did she.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she looked sad. It seemed like she was trying to tell me something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the first firework was shot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both looked at the night sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ray of light soared through the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a loud bang, a large spark was released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like the sparks were about to rain down on us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear the cheers of people around me, along with rounds of applause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The light that lit up the dark night sky in an instant, faded away in an instant too. The place was enveloped in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So pretty…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttered Shiina quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cheeks seemed relaxed, but she looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a barrage of fireworks was released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One after another, they exploded in succession, accompanied by the cheering crowds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fireworks must be beautiful to look at if the crowds were going wild like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wouldn’t know how beautiful they were since my eyes never left Shiina’s side.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>4</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, the loud sound of the fireworks had ceased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked away from Shiina and saw the last spark scattering through the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ended up only seeing the very first and last spark. But I had no regrets since I got to spend all the time sitting next to Shiina. Overall, I felt satisfied already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What about Shiina, though?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if she felt the same way as me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking that, I turned my gaze toward her and saw a drop of tear running down her cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, water droplets slid through her smooth cheeks and fell into the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shiina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can you move your hand away?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lifted my hand that had been placed on top of hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her warmth still lingered in my palm. After all, I had been holding her hand for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can’t do this. We are friends, aren’t we? Friends aren’t supposed to do something like this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We weren’t like Shinji and Yuuka. We weren’t supposed to be that close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Stop doing things that’ll cause misunderstandings.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina before she took some distance from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to betray you…”, she continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the people who were immersed in the afterglow of the fireworks, we were the only ones who were cut off from the rest of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You don’t need to apologize.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I never took a glance at her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what kind of face she was making.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, we achieved our goal for today, watching the fireworks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we went back home. Shiina called a taxi and I went to the parking lot to grab my bike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finally mustered the courage to ask her out on a date, but it turned horribly wrong, somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina refused to let me become closer to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that meant she just liked me as a friend. She had no attachment to me romantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, I got rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a few hours for me to come to terms with that reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><b>Shiina’s PoV</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The credits started playing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several sobbing voices could be heard from our surroundings. It seemed like a lot of people were moved by the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They said that this movie was one of the most popular romance movies and I could see why. The production quality was high and the two main characters were likable. But to me, it felt somewhat empty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the room brightened up, the silence gradually broke down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was great…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san said while smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Kirishima-san was crying so hard that I couldn’t even tell what she was trying to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sniff… Sho… Ghood!&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing her sobs, Shindou-san giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down first. Here, use my handkerchief.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san wiped her tears with the handkerchief. In a normal situation, I’d most likely cry as hard as she did, that was how good the movie was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my current situation wasn’t normal. There was something that bothered me, deep in my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like I was looking at myself from inside a cage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cause of this feeling was most likely the night of the fireworks festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On that day, Godou and I watched the fireworks together while holding hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I felt really happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized how much I loved him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I had to force my feelings from becoming bigger than it currently was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, I feel empty these days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m tired of crying.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s eyes swelled as she flopped her body to her chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san shrugged her shoulders. Meanwhile, I giggled at the sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I envied Kirisihma-san’s empathy, although I wouldn’t want any right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, let’s take a break first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither Kirishima-san nor I had any objections to Shindou-san’s proposal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The theater was attached to a shopping mall, so the food corner was within a walking distance. When we got there, most of the seats were occupied by students like us. Luckily, we managed to find an empty seat near the window. Since I was thirsty, I bought tea, meanwhile Shindou-san and Kirishima-san bought crepes for themselves. I didn’t order any food because I had eaten my lunch before watching the movie and—</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouldn’t say anything more. I’ll make myself feel depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm! So tasty! Good food, good movies, summer vacation is the best time to be alive!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san looked so happy when she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you have to do your club activities tomorrow don’t you, Hina?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t remind me of that! I’ve been trying to keep my mind off of it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha~ Poor you~ Lucky that me and Mai-chan are members of going-home club~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san smiled at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I don’t have part-time jobs, so I just spent my days reading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In my case, I hang out with my other friends every day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san always had this calm and relaxing atmosphere around her. It made me feel comfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Or not, that was a lie. Actually, I spent my days lazing around in my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, me too. Aside from reading, I’d laze around while watching random videos on MeTube.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to Yuuka-san’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Kirishima-san was staring at us in jealousy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You could just quit your club, but you don’t want to do that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah. I mean, it’s fun and I want to win…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s voice was a tone lower than usual, but that made her sound cooler.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So cool.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily said what was in my mind, Kirishima-san shook her head shyly and said, “S-Stop that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-So cute…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I told you to stop!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, Mai-chan knows how to deal with Hina now~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just telling her the truth, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s reaction was quite extreme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback by that, but Shindou-san was just looking at her calmly. After a while, Kirishima-san coughed with a red face and tried to change the topic of the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, I thought you were busy with your cram school, Yuuka?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really. I only need to attend it three times a week, so I have a lot of free time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You go to cram school, Shindou-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. I mean, we&#8217;re in our second year now and after summer vacation, we’ll enter the second term. It’s about time to think about our university entrance exam. I figured I’d do more studying, so I decided to go to cram school for the time being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I triggered an annoying conversation…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san covered both her ears with her hands. But it was Kirishima-san we were talking about, even though she acted like this, she probably studied properly every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the matter of the entrance exam didn’t even slip in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I never really thought about my future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I knew that I’d never be happy in my life. A witch wasn’t an existence that deserved to be happy, so there was no point in thinking about the future. But, now I realized that I was allowed to be happy, thanks to Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about Godou, my chest started to ache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The future… My happiness…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I imagined the scene that’d make me feel the happiest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t take me long to imagine it. After all, it was my biggest wish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To become lovers with Godou. The scene where we treated each other lovingly would be enough to make me feel happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s voice brought me back to reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? You look distressed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shindou-san was also looking at me with a concerned expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I have to go to the toilet…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to deceive them with a smile and ran away to the toilet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I should calm down first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat on the bench by the toilet and let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a lot of thinking, my previously messed up emotions were gradually cooling down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Just a bit more, and I’ll be back to normal again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This overflowing emotion of mine could be contained in a cage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a witch, repressing my own emotion was something that I was good at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, before that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, did I worry you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice sounded so gentle. She then sat beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve been absent-minded all day long.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she noticed…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m not mad at you or anything. Did something happen between you and Godou?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t give her an answer. It seemed like she took my silence as an affirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You went to the fireworks festival with him, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah. Did he tell you that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Since we always go there together, he probably thought that it’d be better to tell me about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I wonder why Godou told Kirishima-san that he chose to be with me rather than her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, this kind of development wasn’t something that I wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt stupid for letting myself indulge in such a dirty desire. Anyway, after reaffirming my relationship with Godou, the atmosphere started to get better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Godou was my friend, nothing more, nothing less.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Be my friend.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words that saved me at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to cherish those words, the words that he chose to define his relationship with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I had to abandon my arrogance, my wish to become lovers with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. So Godou failed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Failed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san’s words confused me. I tilted my head and asked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of answering me, she blinked her eyes in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be… You haven’t noticed?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head even deeper, to the point that my neck hurt. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing my response, Kirishima-san placed her hand on her chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think it’s a good idea if I were to tell you. I’ll keep quiet for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Since you’ve told me this much, it’s unfair to keep me hanging like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. Things between you two went differently than I thought…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again with words that I failed to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she knew something about Godou that I wasn’t aware of. Honestly, it irritated me a little, but the feeling was suppressed by my anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kirishima-san, what do you think of Godou?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words slipped out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why I asked that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I had a feeling that if I were to go back in time, I’d still ask her the same question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence enveloped us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Kirishima-san smiled. There was a tinge of loneliness in that smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you mean?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought my question was clear enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, I knew what her answer was. There was no need for me to ask this question at all in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you asking me if I like him as a man?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her question made me freeze in place. I couldn’t move my mouth to respond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you asking me that, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just curious…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It isn’t like you like him anyway, right, Mai-chan? So, why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, I told her that back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day before the fireworks festival, I told her that there was no way I’d fall in love with Godou.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, yeah, I don’t like him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only asked her out of curiosity, nothing more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There should be nothing more to it. Right?&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san stopped mid-sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be hesitant to continue her sentence, which was unusual for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was something wrong?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and saw her looking at me with a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is it okay for me to go out with Godou?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t breathe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just imagining that scene felt painful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, no matter how many times I thought about it, the two of them were well matched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the perfect person to stand next to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike me who always needed his help, Kirishima-san was someone who was able to help him whenever he needed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had known each other since they were little. They were childhood friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wouldn’t it be wonderful if they got together?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Go ahead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He gave me happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I should give him happiness in return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirishima-san should be able to give him bigger happiness than I ever could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would be the best development.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A happy ending for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a lot of thinking, this was the answer that I came up with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To answer your earlier question…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Kirishima-san looked as if she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, she never did. With a strong tone, she continued,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love him. I love Shiraishi Godou. Out of everyone in this world, I love him the most.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why did her words hurted me more than a slash of a blade did?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I had to bear with this pain. It was my punishment for having such feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Mai-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Kirishima-san apologized to me in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did you make that kind of a face? Why did you apologize to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t understand. I just want her love to be requited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She knew Godou better than me, she knew him longer than me, she deserved this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I encouraged her and said, “Good luck.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There laid the headless body of the hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, he wasn’t a hero anymore. Rather, it was the headless body of a foolish man who betrayed the world because he was seduced by the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he was decapitated on an execution platform in the town square.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The executor was someone from the church and the citizens were watching his execution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The square, which had been in a frenzy, suddenly became enveloped in silence after my sudden appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I was informed of the hero’s execution, I immediately teleported myself here. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I prayed that I wouldn’t be late, but it seemed like that was futile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What an idiot…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered with blood running down from the tip of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From my side, blood was pouring like a stream because of the deep wound I had suffered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It seemed like I would join him soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I heard of his execution, my enemy used the opening to inflict a fatal wound on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guards who were about to detain me stopped after seeing my wounds. They probably were wondering, how could I still be alive. Everyone was looking at me as if they were looking at someone terrifying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of those gazes, I kneeled next to the hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even at the end of his life, he failed to attain happiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All because he tried to save me. If only he chose the correct choice back then, to kill me, he’d probably be living in happiness right now. This wasn’t the kind of ending I wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, I wouldn’t be able to make him happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the same goes for him, he wouldn’t be able to make me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, probably we could suffer through the unhappiness together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, my consciousness faded and I fell down next to his corpse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His blood was covered by mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;May your next life be a happy one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my last ounce of strength, I casted the reincarnation magic on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the end of my previous life’s memory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the end of our story. A bad end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the end of the witch who brought unhappiness to everyone around her.</span></p>
