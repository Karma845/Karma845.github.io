<p><b>Epilogue &#8211; I Chose You Over the World</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next day. Due to the excitement from last night, I ended up having to go to school while being sleep-deprived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door to the classroom… An unusual scene greeted me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was looking at me with warm gazes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around and noticed that Shiina had already sat on her seat. Perhaps because it had been a while since she came to school, a lot of people in the class surrounded her. When our eyes met, she sent me an apologetic look with a red face for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Godou? I heard you made a passionate confession to Mai-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl who was grinning and teasing me was Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Mai told everyone that much?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get mad at her, we forced her to spill everything out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t even want to talk about it. It’s part of my black history now, I want to forget everything about it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is that so?…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mean it like that! It was just embarrassing for me because I did it in that kind of place! Stop making that sad look!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m talking about us being seen by the security guard and him misunderstanding the situation…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see… I thought I mistook the situation. So yesterday wasn’t a dream, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, yesterday was real. From now on, I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to continue my speech when I remembered that we were in our classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was grinning at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, they immediately started flirting…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The air is so hot over here~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, this is technically their first day, so can’t blame them~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so on. It was the first time since the ball tournament that everyone looked like they were having fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut it! Go away! Shoo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waved my hands around. Everyone laughed at me before going back to their seats. There were some people who stayed behind, the usual group of Hina, Shinji and Yuuka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you, dude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shinji while giving me a round of applause lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuuka was looking at Hina with a complicated look on her face. As if drawn by her, I turned my gaze toward Hina too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it. I was the one who made you do it, remember?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it while wearing her usual smile. At the very least she didn’t look depressed or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile was so bright that it was hard for me to tell what was inside her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, you should thank me instead. I was the one who brought you together, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She puffed out her big chest. Seeing that, Mai nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This idiot is too much for me to handle, so Mai-chan, I’ll leave him to you, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes! I’ll do my best!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai, you started talking formally again, jeez. Weren’t you two friends?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, it seemed like something happened between the two of them. It didn’t seem like something I should know about, though. Well, in any case, I expect that things will go back to normal soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I’ve never thought that there would come a day when I’d hear you shout out your love confession.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji tried to change the subject, which was good. Except that the subject he was bringing up was bad for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how much Mai told you, but, shut your trap please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop giving me those warm gazes!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn, I couldn’t even argue against them because they didn’t give me any opening to say anything!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I guess I’d have to endure this kind of gaze for a while longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, uh… I-I said that I wanted him to call me by my name, so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did you feel the need to explain it to them?! That was the worst thing you could do in this situation!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All three of them had the corners of their mouths raised in amusement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh! F**k me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wish you two happiness!~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the three of them left while laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai and I were the only ones left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt some people staring at us, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my gaze to Mai, who was letting out a light cough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Everyone was worried about my well-being, s-so they asked me why I was taking a few days off…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what did you tell them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Everything…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course you did that! So that was why they gave me that kind of look!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone were absent from school for a long time, suddenly came to school and everyone found that the reason why they were absent was because of love trouble, it was inevitable they’d send that person warm gazes like that! Seriously, I wish they could stop… It was embarrassing…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to spend all night rolling around in my bed because of the embarrassment and now I have to deal with this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wherever I went, I received emotional damage. I swear, I’ll die out of embarrassment soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I got involved with Mai in this life, it felt like I’ve gone through a lot of embarrassing things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly became a living black history mass-producer. Seriously, give me a break. There was only so much I could do to hide behind the word ‘youth.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Can I talk with you for a minute?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of hesitation, Mai asked me that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you free on Saturday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I’m free, I don’t have a shift that day. What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Do you want to… G-Go on a date with me?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-D-Date?! …S-Sure… B-But what do you want to do for the date?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I don’t know… B-But lovers are supposed to go on dates, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that. I looked up ‘the things that lovers do’ on the internet last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Then, let’s go on a date…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright… Then, I’ll call you tonight so we can decide on what to do for the date.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Mai said that the teacher entered the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning homeroom started peacefully as always.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only differences were that Mai and I were lovers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked over at Mai’s seat and saw her looking at me while waving lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a soft smile on her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…So cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to believe that this was the same girl who’d glared at me the moment our eyes met not too long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved in two months ago. We became friends just a month after that and we became lovers yesterday. Looking back, a lot has happened in two months. I could safely say that these two months was an eventful period of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me, a hero from another world and her, a witch from another world. No one would have ever imagined that the two people who were always at each other’s throats would become lovers after being reincarnated in another world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that Shiina’s back, the classroom feels a lot brighter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher’s joke brought me back to reality. I could see Mai was bowing her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, the homeroom was over and our first class, physics, started. Since we had to move to another classroom, I got up from my seat with my notebook and textbook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai, who had finished getting ready, was waiting for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, we’re going there together?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on out, wherever we go, we’ll be together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone’s gazes made me feel embarrassed…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You reap what you sow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I mean, if I didn’t say anything, someone might try to snatch you away from me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one would even think of doing that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You wouldn’t know. Unlike me, you’re popular.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at yourself in the mirror. You’re popular with the boys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked side by side in the hallway while having such exchanges.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Mai muttered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I wish I could stay with you forever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until the day I die? You’ll be there when I die, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. You’ll outlive me, that’s for sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t wanna. I outlived you in our previous life, now it’s your turn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no point in living if you’re dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel the same way. Think of my feelings if you die before me, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not accepting that apology until you promise me that you’ll outlive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you’re the reason why I’m alive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Y-Yeah, i-it’s like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But, what if we have kids?… Or maybe even grandchildren…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;K-Kids, huh? I-I guess they could become my reason to live…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-See?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hmm… K-Kids, huh?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Mai, who was looking at me with a red face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that instant, her gaze turned stern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her lips twitched before she muttered,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you looking at me like that, pervert?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop being unreasonable!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t the one who brought the topic up!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your gaze was disgusting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It isn’t! …Maybe. I’d like to think so at least…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you sound so unsure?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to say that my thoughts didn’t go in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> direction, I would be lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If it’s you, I don’t mind even if you look at me with that kind of gaze.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;O-Okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it while writhing. I didn’t know how to respond to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, it’s too early for that. We have to get married first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your standard is way too outdated…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;We’re getting married anyway, so just be patient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she said so, then I guess I’ll be patient with her. I could put up with this easily. I loved her that much, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to do it with her as soon as I could, but I should be able to restrain myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That was a lie.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I shrugged my shoulders, Mai said that to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I wouldn’t be able to wait until we get married.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uh, what? She was turning her gaze away. What was that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how to respond after hearing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, what the hell were we talking about this early in the morning? In the school hallway nonetheless!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were whispering to each other, so people wouldn’t hear what we were talking about, but since the fact that we were dating was known to everyone, people were bound to have their eyes on us. If they were to see our red faces… My black history started to pile up again, didn’t it?&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Let’s just stop talking about this! W-Why don’t we talk about something more… Wholesome?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah, let’s do that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was clear that the two of us were panicking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear giggling voices from the people around us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, they’re laughing at you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It’s because you’re looking at me with strange eyes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I only did it because you started saying weird things!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, I-I’m sorry too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had the feeling that whenever Mai and I were together, people would laugh at us just like this. We’d continue producing black history and ended up rolling over our beds to contemplate it every single night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we were both new to this. To love and to life in general.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if I were with her… It didn’t feel as bad as I previously thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, a man called Shiraishi Godou said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you. Marry me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, a woman called Shiina Mai said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes. I love you too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fin</span></p>
