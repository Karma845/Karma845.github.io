<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Reincarnation, Transmigration and Fateful Reunion</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Shiina Mai. Nice to meet you, everyone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her lovely voice roused my consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took me, Shiraishi Godou, a while to clear my consciousness but, gradually, I became more aware of the things that happened around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This place was a second year classroom of Ryoumei High in Gunma Prefecture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current time was 9am. In other words, the homeroom was still ongoing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming the situation, I turned my gaze to the front of the classroom. There was a beautiful girl standing in front of the podium. Her black hair was long and glossy. Though my consciousness was hazy, her beautiful face didn’t fail to captivate me. Her stature was small, but that only enhanced her cuteness if anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t recognize neither her appearance nor her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how forgetful I was, it should be impossible for me to not recognize any of my classmates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was racking my brain in that direction, I suddenly remembered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other day, the homeroom teacher said that there would be a transfer student coming to this class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Now, everything finally started to make sense. That was the reason why she was standing in front of everyone like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t expect the transfer student to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> pretty, though…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her dainty appearance took everyone by surprise. Not only the boys were captivated, even the girls too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, she’s crazy cute! Damn, I’m excited now! What about you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy sitting in front of me turned around and started talking to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… I guess, yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Halfway through my reply, I let out a yawn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Godou? You seem to be in low spirits today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy who was currently tilting his head to my direction was my bad friend, Kudou Shinji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beneath his brown hair was a disgustingly good looking face. His stature was bigger than me, but the way he dressed was sloppier than me. Every inch of his body screamed ‘frivolous’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I worked until late last night. I’m sleepy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered while rubbing my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, perhaps because of the appearance of the cute transfer student, my drowsiness was already halfway gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still at it, huh? Your part time job, I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Gotta do it if I want to get more money. As long as you have money, you can do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, you and your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> villain act.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji laughed out loud. Suddenly he grinned, an idea probably came up in his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, if your workplace is in need of help, why don’t you ask that transfer student to work there? Your workload will decrease and you’ll get to know a cutie like her, two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;And the catch is? No way you’re suggesting something like this for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. You’ll have to introduce her to me afterwards!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He hit me on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re just trying to make use of me, aren’t you? …Besides, I don’t think she’s the kind of person who’ll break the school’s rules for no reason like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They kinda tolerated it but, strictly speaking, working part-time was against the school’s rules.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The transfer student, Shiina Mai, was it? …She looked quite nervous currently, but I could tell that she was a serious student. She was definitely not the kind of student who would break school rules for no reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiina finished her introduction and sat down. Her seat was on the opposite side of the room compared to mine, which was by the window. It was simply too far away for me to walk there and start a conversation with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello! Can I call you ‘Shiina-san’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do you do! Woah, you’re prettier up close!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was greeted by everyone in her vicinity. Judging from the flustered look on her face, though, she didn’t seem to be someone who was good at socializing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She seems to be a bona fide beautiful girl, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji nodded happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy had the tendency to use that pretty face of his to ensnare every beautiful girl he found. To put it simply, he was your average philanderer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls in the class were aware of this, so he had a bad reputation among them. He didn’t seem to care about that, though. Well, his scope of activity wasn’t restricted to the school ground, so I guess receiving the ire of his girl classmates wasn’t a big deal to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The girls in this class are pretty, but they are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">impure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. I mean, look at those hairs. What’s the point of dying them brown or blonde? There is a severe lack of black-haired beauty around here and then, the new girl came! Like an oasis in the desert! Her existence is perfect!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She didn’t move in here to satisfy your fetish, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Shinji listlessly before turning my gaze to Shiina again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By this time, the homeroom had ended and she was surrounded by the other girls. It was difficult to tell what was happening from here, but they seemed to be bombarding the poor girl with questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was something every transfer student had to go through at one point in their life. If they weren’t good at socializing, well, tough luck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two aren’t going to talk to her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A gentle voice reached my ears. A girl with permed brown hair approached us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, look at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… I can’t talk to her even if I want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, pointing to the swarm of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Godou is Godou, but what about you, Shinji? I thought you’d be the first one crawling over to her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know when to back down. That’s one reason why I’m popular to begin with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He let out a snort before shrugging his shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I’m in no hurry. They’ll get sick of doing that soon enough anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treating people like a freak show, nice personality you got there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just stating a fact. That’s just how humans are. After they get used to her presence, her surroundings will die down. Besides, from the way Shiina is acting, this situation won’t stay like this for too long.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the girl who was sighing at Shinji’s words was Kirishima Hina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Shiina, she was a beautiful girl. She had big, bright eyes and a high nose. Her skin was white without blemish and her lips were luscious and plump. In addition to her heavenly face, she had a slender waist and was blessed with an ample amount of meat in her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it, Godou? Why are you staring at me like that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had known each other since we were kids. In other words, we were childhood friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our relationship was so close that we felt more like siblings than friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Don’t mind me. Anyway, what kind of person is she? Shiina Mai, I meant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked that question to change the topic. Hina tilted her head in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… I don’t know… I was there for a bit, but we didn’t talk much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By ‘there’, she meant that she was among the crowds who talked to Shiina, if it wasn’t obvious already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She seems to be a serious and quiet girl, but then again, it’s her first day here, so she’s probably nervous. Give her time and we’ll know what her actual personality is like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shinji nodded his head and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though she is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> pretty, she doesn’t seem to have much self-confidence. Is she unaware of her beauty? Or is she just overly self-conscious about it? I wonder what kind of person she is~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you try to ask her directly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I hope that she is the former type. It’ll be easy to make her fall for me if that’s the case. I’ll only need to give her enough praise, that’ll do the magic. Though, the chance of her being the former is low though. I mean, there aren’t many people who’re that self-unaware…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t care. Didn’t ask.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words had a semblance of truth in it though. There was no way that people hadn’t praised her look already, so she should be aware of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about such things, I stared at Shiina, who was talking with one of the girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, our eyes met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gaze felt unnaturally sharp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized that I was staring at her for too long, so I averted my gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, that sharp gaze of hers felt unreal. She didn’t seem to have a strong enough personality to do that. Even now, she was still smiling awkwardly at the classmates who were talking to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Imma go to the toilet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered before standing up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first class wouldn’t start for a while, so might as well get finished with my business first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have fun~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t use this as an excuse to skip class later, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I headed for the door while being escorted by the waves of troublesome people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To get to the door, I passed by Shiina’s seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air felt strangely familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to stay and investigate this, but it would be weird if I were to suddenly stop in front of the transfer student’s seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I decided to let it go. I went outside the classroom with furrowed brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was walking down the hallway, I started to rack my brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was that feeling?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like I knew the transfer student from somewhere. Neither her appearance nor her voice were familiar to me, but it felt like I knew her well. It was… Her atmosphere… Yeah, I recognized that atmosphere…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air around her felt so familiar to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I failed to connect it to a specific person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Were we acquaintances? If so, when or where did we meet?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many questions surfaced, but it seemed like those questions wouldn’t be answered anytime soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, everything could just be my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear? They said that the new transfer student in class 2 is a real cutie!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that. I’ve been curious about it… Wanna take a look later?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve already done that. She’s a real cutie. I almost thought she was an idol for a second there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking toward the toilet, I could hear the other students talking about the new girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess the news reached the other class already, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t surprising though, since she was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved in right before the summer vacation, a really strange time to be transferring school as it was halfway through the school year. Did she have a reason in particular? Well, there was no way that she did it without a real reason behind it… While thinking about such things, I arrived at my destination, the toilet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to open the door to finish my business quickly…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice called out to me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I have a word with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heightened my guard in reflex.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> didn’t notice someone creeping up on me until they were this close? How did this happen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around to see who it was, the first thing that came to my sight was a pair of jewel-like eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, my sight received more information about the person before me. Her long, beautiful black hair. A face so beautiful that it wouldn’t be strange if you were to fall in love with her at the first sight. Short stature that only enhanced her cuteness. Without a doubt, this person was the transfer student, Shiina Mai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, there is no need to look </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> surprised. I know that I called you out of nowhere and I’m new around here, but I’m still your classmate, aren’t I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina with a mysterious smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike her meek attitude at class, she was acting quite haughtily in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What did you just do? Just who the hell are you, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I narrowed my eyes and asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I focused my gaze on her so I wouldn’t be missing the slightest bit of her reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t let my guard down and I had a good reason for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way a student from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this world</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> could creep up on me without me knowing like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I introduce myself previously? Shiina Mai. That’s my real name, you know? In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this world</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, at least.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Shiina in a mocking tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This world</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, I didn’t miss that part of her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That fearless look of her meant that it wasn’t spoken in jest, so that could only mean one thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was related to my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s been a long time, Hero. Your appearance in this world doesn’t look as manly as before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she called me. That tone. That high-handed attitude. I knew this girl very well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I previously failed to connect the dot because her current appearance looked nothing like her previous one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finally you’ve noticed. You’ve lost your touch, haven’t you? Taking so long just to notice something trivial like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was like me, a reincarnated individual, then it wasn’t strange that she would look different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The transfer student’s appearance overlapped with a certain someone from my previous world’s appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… The Witch of Calamity… Cerys?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my surprised shout, Shiina Mai, no, the witch, Cerys, nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, Shiraishi Godou, had memories of my previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, I was known as Grey Handlet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was born, grew and died in a different world than the one I was currently in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those memories were my own memories, I was certain of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back when I was a child, I only dreamed of those memories occasionally, but as I grew older, the frequency of the dreams started to increase. At first, I only thought of them as a series of realistic dreams, but the continuity and the consistency of these convinced me that it wasn’t the case. Besides, those dreams weren’t something that could be produced by a child’s limited imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At one point in my life, I suspected that I was afflicted with some kind of mental illness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a time when I consulted my parents about it. I managed to convince them that I had been constantly having nightmares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could elaborate more by telling them the details of the dreams. Like, how in those dreams, I was a young man living in the world of sword and magic and so on. But I didn’t want my parents to treat me like a lunatic, so I decided not to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, my parents brought me to a hospital, but they found nothing wrong with my brain. They dismissed it as me having a severe case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chuunibyou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, which I clearly wasn’t, but I didn’t want to start a fight, so I just hid my dissatisfaction deep inside my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t until the summer of my first year of high school that I finally remembered everything about my previous life. I realized that the boy named Grey Handlet was my previous identity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…But, I’ve never told anyone about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would believe me even if I told them. The people of this world wouldn&#8217;t believe in the existence of another world. To them, reincarnation and transmigration were something that only happened in fiction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, even I didn’t know why I was reincarnated in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, I got reincarnated in another world, with my memories intact nonetheless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The situation revolving around my reincarnation was a complete mystery. I didn’t know what exactly happened and I had no way to find out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I decided to live as an ordinary high school student in the meantime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why I was reincarnated, but this was a chance for me to live a second life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I’d live my life freely without being tied to something like heroic duty or whatnot. Or so I thought. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without warning, those peaceful days had crumbled down at this very moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You still can’t believe my words, can you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch, Shiina, smiled as she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after, a silver staff appeared in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hadn’t brought anything resembling the staff, it really appeared out of nowhere. The thing was as tall as her body and there was no way that she could hide it inside her school uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the phenomenon that defied the law of physics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The technique that manipulated the unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This should be sufficient as a proof. After all, witches don’t exist in this world.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This world was ruled by something called science instead of magic. That was the reason why I’ve never seen a mage or something similar in this world. Even if they existed, they wouldn’t be flailing their magic around as they would be busy hiding. Besides, their existence would be something really rare. Also, the average person in this world thought of magic as something that only existed in fiction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can use magic in this world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just some simple magic like what I did just now. The reason why this world isn&#8217;t aware of the existence of magic is because mana itself is scarce here. Just gathering enough of them to use the lowest tier of magic takes a huge amount of effort. Even I, the strongest witch, has to gather them for years to use a higher tier magic, so it’s no wonder that the residents of this world aren’t aware of mana. It’s really inconvenient. Back in the other world, I could gather that much mana overnight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch said in a displeased tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was why she used a simple magic like this instead of just transforming the whole school building into something else entirely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the witch, I couldn’t use any magic. Not back then, not now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I simply didn’t have a talent for magic. Besides, I didn’t need magic to fulfill my duty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiina Mai. It’s hard to believe, but after seeing your magic, I have to accept it whether I like it or not… That you’re the reincarnation of the Witch of Calamity, Cerys… That aside…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I asked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is going on?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aware that my question was vague.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it couldn’t be helped. I didn’t even know where to start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We both transmigrated, reincarnated and met each other again in this world? There is no way that this is a coincidence. Is this part of your plan? Is our reincarnation your doing? Tell me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, where should I start?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch put her hand over her mouth and pondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be struggling with how she should start her explanation as she didn’t seem to show any reluctance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the bell for the first period rang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… The class should have started already, well, whatever, it can’t be helped considering the circumstances.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven’t skipped too many classes and it felt a shame that I had to do it today, but it couldn’t be helped. This matter was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> important, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Witch? What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, her face turned pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-Nothing… Y-Yeah, you’re right, it can’t be helped considering the circumstances…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a series of coughs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be, she was bothered by this? Was it the first time she ever skipped class or something?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really? Was this the same person as the one who plunged the world into disaster? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Witch of Calamity, Cerys Flores?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No way she was bothered by this right? Yeah, no way in hell. It was probably my imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone might hear us if we were to talk here. Let’s move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our surroundings were quiet, probably because the class had started already. The only voice that could be heard was the teachers’ voice leaking from the classrooms. From that, it was easy to tell that if we were to talk here, everyone inside the classroom could also hear our voices. If we didn’t move somewhere else, they would find out that we were skipping class quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The rest area in front of the club building should be deserted, let’s go there…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thinking of a perfect place to talk, I turned my back to her, but I suddenly felt a sharp killing intent from her direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately turned around in reflex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch bent her knees and kicked the floor of the hallway to sprung her body toward me. She appeared right in front of me. Almost instantly, she thrusted her staff right in front of my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her movement was fast. All I could do was to follow her movements with my eyes and nothing else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel my spine becoming cold as she narrowed her eyes after seeing my pathetic state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Just as I thought, you’ve lost the powers of your previous life. The old you would’ve easily dodged this even when I fully reinforced my whole body with magic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was way weaker than back in my previous life. Well, it wasn’t even worth comparing to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The human’s body in this world is poor. It’s hard to move around like I did in the previous world.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people in that world were much stronger than in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, the people in the other world were just built different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their basic capabilities were pretty much the same, but the warriors from that world were able to do superhuman feats after a little training. They could run hundreds of meters in less than five seconds, jump ten meters or more without preparation, smash through rocks with their swords and shatter chunks of iron with their fists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My feats in particular, were extraordinary even among those superhumans. After all, I was the world’s strongest hero. I was a superhuman among those superhumans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, that was a story from the past. Right now, I was only a little stronger than a normal high school student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I guess that’s the case, huh? I was just trying to confirm my guess, so no need to be afraid of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure you weren’t actually trying to kill me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I complained to the witch who withdrew her staff from my throat. I felt relieved by the action, but I still felt bitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We should move to somewhere deserted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She crossed her arms, as if to say ‘lead the way’. I had no choice but to follow her biddings, I could try to disobey her, but she would probably kill me if I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While walking, I started to think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About the differences between the physical ability between the human of this world and another one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to see if I could regain the power I had back in my previous life, but to no avail. No matter how hard I trained, I couldn’t regain even a percent of my power back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was the influence of magic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch in a matter-of-fact manner. It seemed like she was aware of what I was thinking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The warriors from the other world absorbed the mana around them when they were training. Even if they didn’t have the talents required to do magic, the mana they absorbed wouldn’t dissipate. The more they trained their body, the more mana that would assimilate into their bodies and the stronger their body would get.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first time that I’ve ever heard of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a well known theory in the other world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, in a way, the warriors from the other worlds were also magic users.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conflicts between warriors and mages weren’t uncommon in that world. If this kind of theory were to spread around in that world, it would turn it upside down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never knew about that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded, hiding my surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying absurd things without batting an eye like that, she hadn’t changed at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, there is too little mana in this world to make that phenomenon possible. Let alone letting the mana assimilate to your body, rousing them in the first place is hard enough. That’s why, I don’t think you’ll be able to get your power back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> It was hard to believe, but her logic was sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a master of magic and she knew about mana and such more than I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, her theory was still in the realm of logic, I couldn’t refute her words even if I wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This place should be good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We arrived at the rest area in front of the club building. There were benches and vending machines here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place was near the entrance of the gym and was often used by the members of the sports club. Normally, this place would be crowded, but there were certain hours when it was deserted just like right now. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to face the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I narrowed my eyes, watching the witch’s every move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, what is it? Are you still holding a grudge over my previous action?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I won’t let you have your way on me more than once.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can’t win against me no matter how hard you try, don’t you know that? Unlike you, I still have my power. Yes, it’s hard to use it, but it’s still something compared to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch while smiling mysteriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, I’ve been wondering about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I lost my power, but I still had ample amounts of combat experience from my past life. Even if my power was merely at the level of a normal high school boy, I should be unbeatable when it came to fighting if my opponents were merely normal humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the witch enhanced her body with magic, as long as she didn’t do a surprise attack like last time, I would still be able to retaliate. Besides, she said it herself, she couldn’t use higher tier magic even if she wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I’m not going to kill you. I mean, what’s the point?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I guess so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch turned her back on me. Seeing that, I let my guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right, what was the point? If I were to push myself, I could win and kill her if I wanted to, but there was no point in doing that. The only thing that would come out of it was that they would brand me as a criminal for assaulting a high school girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want something to drink?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked the witch who was looking at the vending machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my wallet and put a hundred yen coin into the machine, then I chose a canned coffee randomly. By the way, most of the drinks in the machine cost a hundred yen each, so they were affordable by the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She rummaged through her pocket then turned away awkwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn’t bring your wallet?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s in my bag…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’ll buy you juice then. It’s to celebrate our reunion, I guess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the canned coffee then opened it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pleasant sound echoed as I did it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I remember you used to like apple juice, am I right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I managed to remember that trivial thing she said from our previous life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t say anything to my question, so I took her silence as a ‘yes’ and bought an apple juice from the vending machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch as she furrowed her brows and turned her face away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, that was a surprise. I didn’t expect her to thank me at all. I guess her parents in this world taught her a little about manners, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or it could also be that this world influenced her in a way or another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps noticing what I was thinking about, she scowled at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it? That’s for me, isn’t it? Hurry up and give it to me then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, here, take it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, W-Wait!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I threw the can so suddenly, she flailed her hands, attempting to catch it midair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She managed to do it, but between the pompous gestures she previously made and her current appearance… The gap was surely something, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down, you don’t need to use such big moves to catch something like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about just hand it to me properly instead of throwing it away suddenly like that?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your reflex is as horrible as always. You still can’t react to sudden movements like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can! I just need to use my magic!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t use it for something trivial like this. Didn’t you say it’s hard to gather mana in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch turned her face away with a ‘hmph’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That looked kinda cute actually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike in the other world when she had a bewitching appearance, her current appearance made the arrogant gestures that she normally did look cute instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, it’s time to talk about the real topic at hand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right… But first, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you fully remember everything from your previous life?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last year, during the summer. Before that time, I only dreamed about them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… Around the same time as me then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, is your question related to why you’re approaching me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how you looked at it, there was no way that she transferring here was a coincidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, she was aware of my identity as Grey even before we started talking to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have some kind of goal, I’m sure of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be… You’re approaching me to take revenge on me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Didn’t I tell you earlier that doing something like that is pointless?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why the hell did you transfer here in the first place?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t find another reason for her to transfer here other than to see me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do I explain this… I’m here to confirm your presence here… Also to observe you, I guess…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confirm? I knew it, this whole transmigration thing was your doing, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct. I need you to be here, that’s why I sent you here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She answered my question, but she kept glossing over the important thing while acting all pompous. It seemed like she was hiding something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You need me to be here? Elaborate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She frowned at me when I asked that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she disliked that question, but what else could I do? I had to know the answer, who cared about her feelings on the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how to explain it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’re bad at explaining things, so don’t worry, take your time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch fiddled with the apple juice she was holding. With her gaze at the ground, she opened her mouth to speak,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know… I… live… And…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;And?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could barely hear her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I furrowed my brows to show my unamused expression, she,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closed her eyes and cried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t live without you, okay?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…What?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that I wasn’t hearing things, I asked her a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you on about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, I’m not saying this because I want to, okay? It’s just the way it is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked away, her face was red like a tomato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, I realized something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you fall for me? Was that a confession?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No, it’s not!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I didn’t notice your feelings sooner… But still, sorry, I can’t accept that feeling of yours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I coolly rejected her while fiddling with my hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was one of my normal girl classmates, I would be excited when hearing her confession, but she was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> witch, so yeah, no way I would be excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop it! I-I didn’t mean it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> way, okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you talking about then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, figures. There was no way that she would harbor such feelings toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, our relationship wasn’t that simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both the witch and I were sworn nemesis in our previous lives. We tried to kill each other countless times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We might have feelings toward each other, but rather than love, it was hatred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why her ‘confession of love’ sounded ridiculous to me the first time I heard it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brought my face closer to hers, but she backed away quickly with a reddened face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-You’re too close!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our faces weren’t close enough for her to be blushing like that, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like in her previous life, she was still bad at socializing, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch coughed and took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;As you know, my soul is cursed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the price you had to pay for cursing the world, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Like they said, you get what you paid for. There’s always a price to pay whenever I use witchcraft. In exchange for cursing the world and plunging it into disaster, a curse equivalent to that curse in power was bound to my very soul.” (T/N: Author used 呪術 (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jujutsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">) here, which has the same meaning as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">魔法 (Mahou)/Magic, but since the kanji for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jujutsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> literally meant ‘curse technique’, I’ll be translating it to ‘witchcraft’ instead. I could translate it to ‘sorcery’ like what they did to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jujutsu Kaisen/</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sorcery Fight, but I think ‘witchcraft’ is more fitting in this context.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While they used the same mana to operate, witchcraft was different from normal magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witchcraft was a rare branch of magic that was born by infusing mana with dark emotions. It had a more destructive nature than normal magic, but the user had to pay the cost of casting such magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of that demerit, the branch of magic was abandoned hundreds of years before I was born. Normal magic was simply way more convenient as you didn’t need to kill yourself just to inflict some damage to your enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was until </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">she </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">managed to revive it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> was able to single-handedly plunge the world into a disaster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I were to die, my soul would disappear and the curse that was bound to my soul would lose its vessel and spread throughout the world. There’s no one in this world who can suppress this curse other than me, that’s why…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard the same thing came out from her mouth back in the previous world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, what she said back then didn’t actually happen in the previous world. Instead, she was reincarnated into this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, does that mean that the same curse wouldn’t afflict the other world?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if she knew what I was thinking about, the witch continued to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I was about to die, I used reincarnation magic. It won’t change anything as my soul will still be bound by the curse, but at least I can buy some time with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand why you did that, but why did you choose to reincarnate in another world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s because… I don’t want to put that world in danger anymore… It’s the world you just saved after all… If I transferred my soul into another world, that world would be safe…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch, as if she was reassuring me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did wonder what would happen if another calamity struck that world once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no more hero in that world, could the people survive?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, that wasn’t important for now. The witch said something that bugged me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, then won’t this world be in danger instead?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct. Well, I didn’t care about what would happen to the world that I didn’t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch with a dismissive tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was obvious that she was lying though, so I asked her,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what’s your plan? If you’ve talked this much, that means you have some kind of plan to save this world somehow, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wouldn’t be here, speaking to me, if she didn&#8217;t actually care about what happened to this world. After all, she put so much effort into making sure that the curse wouldn’t spread in the other world even though she hated it. There was no way that she would feign indifference toward a world she didn’t know of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t like the way you speak as if you’ve figured me out… But yes, you’re correct…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pointed at my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You. You’re the plan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was why she dragged me to this world with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you need my exorcism, huh?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exorcism. It was exactly what it called, a technique to exorcize demons and curses. (T/N: While the author used 祓魔 (Futsuma) here, which refers to strictly Christianity’s way of exorcism instead of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">祓 (Harae) which is Shinto’s way of exorcism, for some reason, the exorcism this novel is talking about is Shinto’s exorcism. In other words, fighting demons and purifying curses and the supernaturals is part of the jobdesc instead of only dealing with evil spirit possession.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By interfering and dispersing mana flow, it could nullify every phenomenon that was caused by magic. Witchcraft was no exception to this. Although it was different in nature than normal magic, one still needed mana to perform witchcraft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The user of exorcism was also rare, that was because only those who were unable to manipulate mana could perform it. In other words, only ‘talentless’ people could do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There weren’t many people who couldn’t use mana in the previous world. You could scour the entire continent and at most, you’d only find a hundred or so of such people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. You’re the only one who could dispel my curse, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was one of those people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being able to use exorcism was the pre-requirements to kill the witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exorcists like me were natural counters to the witch since she thrived by manipulating mana. (T/N: 祓魔師 (Futsuma-shi/Exorcist) was used here instead of Priest or something like that.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was possible for other people to kill her, but if they were to do that, the curse in the witch’s body would spiral out of control and bring even bigger disaster to the world. That was why only exorcists were allowed to kill them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was the reason why I was chosen as a hero in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, aside from my status as the world’s strongest swordsman, I was also the world’s strongest exorcist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mission was to kill the Witch of Calamity and to save the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, will you help me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch laughed and glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a hint of hatred in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If only you’ve done your job properly back then, everything wouldn&#8217;t have come to this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words were true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only nod my head weakly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got it, fine, I’ll do my best to help you… How though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Use your exorcism to gradually dispel the curse from my soul, that’s the only way to do it without killing me. It’ll probably take a few decades for everything to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So that’s what you meant by ‘I can’t live without you’, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Sorry in advance, but you’re stuck with me during that time period.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The easiest way to dispel the curse would be to kill the witch herself. There would be a period of time when the curse would stay dormant and that would be the timing to dispel the curse completely. It was just, if you failed to dispel the curse during that time, the curse would afflict the witch killer’s soul instead and we had to go back to square one if that were to happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, the easiest way to do it would be to kill me right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That period of time when the curse stayed dormant was the moment when the curse itself was at its weakest so it would be easy to dispel it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a hero, that was part of my job description. To kill the witch and dispel the curse that was bound to her soul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’d say so. Seriously, you’re such a troublesome person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This part of her hadn’t changed. Even after her reincarnation, she still treated her life lightly like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me remind you of one thing. There are no magic users in this world. That means no mages, exorcists or heroes like you. We only have one chance in this and if we fail, this world will be doomed. There’s no way that the residents of this world will be able to fight the demons.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Demons. (T/N: Author used </span><span style="font-weight: 400">魔物 (Mamono/Monster) here. Other possible translations are demon and evil spirit. For now I’ll be translating it as demon because it’s more fitting to the exorcist theme and less mouthful than evil spirit. Might change if they introduced actual demons later in the series.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The embodiment of a curse in the form of a monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They feed on dark emotions and could only act on their instincts to kill humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of them had strength and agility that surpassed that of a normal human.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the witch’s curse, demons spread through the other world in great numbers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it wasn’t because of the magic users risking their lives to fight them, humanity would’ve gone extinct already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, if demons were to appear in this world…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, I still don’t want to kill you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re such a troublesome person. How many times have I told you that this is the fastest way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speak for yourself. If things were that simple, you wouldn’t go out of your way to transfer to this school. You could just have approached me and begged me to kill you. Why did you go out of your way to do something troublesome?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She furrowed her brows and let out another deep sigh. It seemed like I hit a sore spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fine, fine. In that case, you have to spend the rest of your life with me. That’s the price you have to pay for keeping me alive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, that’s a surprise. Who knows that you’d give up this quickly. Back in the other world, you’d stop at nothing to make me kill you. Like seriously, don’t place a dagger in my hand when I’m asleep. That’s not the kind of night crawling that I want to experience.” (T/N: If you don’t know, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">夜這い (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yobai</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">/night crawling) is a custom in ancient Japanese where an unmarried man would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">crawl</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to unmarried woman’s room at night. If the woman consented, they would do the deed. It’s one of the ways for ancient Japanese men to find a wife.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a suic*dal, stop treating me like one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After everything that you’ve done, you might as well be one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I rubbed the frown on my forehead, the witch pouted and turned her face away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Back in my previous life, I was all alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only halfway through your life. I was always by your side for the rest of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being able to casually say something like that… That part of you didn’t change…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she looked at me with disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she opened her mouth to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There was no one who mourned me when I finally died except for you… Seriously, what were you thinking? I was your enemy, for hell’s sake…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exactly what she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter which world we came to, we would always be enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still, you were right… I have a family now… I don’t care about my own life, but if I were to die… My family would be sad…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered those words while blushing furiously. Seeing her in this state, a series of chuckles escaped my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Why are you laughing?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Don’t mind me… Good for you then, Witch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was being sincere when I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was no longer alone in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That smile of yours pisses me off… Hmph.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch snorted, crossed her arms in front of her chest and leaned against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a familiar posture, but it felt different somehow…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t know why, but that posture looks weird on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… Is it because you look different now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the differences in her appearance, her posture just felt too off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up! As if you also don&#8217;t look different from your previous life!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you implying that I look uglier now?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I didn’t say anything like that! B-Besides, your current look doesn’t look bad…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of her, she managed to poke where it hurts without realizing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t manage to catch the latter half of her muttering, but whatever, I’ll forgive her for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your case, you looked pretty back then, but now you’re more cute than pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-Cute– A-Ahem… I’m not happy from hearing your praises, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her appearance once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she was a second year like me, she should be in her sixteen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was around the same age as in her previous life, but aside from her facial features, her body proportion also differed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to back then, there were two things that were missing from her appearance. Those two things were something that she was proud of. Two </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">big things</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Where are you staring at?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch hid her chest with both hands, as if to shield it from my gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, don’t worry about it too much, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t give me that pitying look! I’m still growing, okay?! They’ll grow for sure!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was rare to see her flustered like this. Since that was the case, it should be fine for me to get carried away a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You had such an amazing figure back then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll sue you for sexual harrassment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I know that the only good thing about you was taken away from you, but don’t be like this. There’s still hope for you… Maybe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see, so that’s how it is. You think I wouldn’t dare to throw hands? Let’s see how you’ll love these hands–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She exuded a thick killing intent as she said that. I had to take a few steps back because of the pressure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“V-Violence isn’t the answer to everything, you know? C-Calm down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Haa… Whatever. Let’s go back to the classroom quickly. It’ll be bad if I miss the entire morning classes on my first day. Also, to tell you the truth, I really didn’t want to miss the first period…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the witch after looking at her watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed suit by taking out my phone. Sure enough, the first period had ended already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The witch turned away and started to walk away. I was about to follow her when I noticed something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, what’s up with your act back in the homeroom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? It’s my honor student act, you got a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, an honor student wouldn’t skip class on the first day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Stop bringing that up! You know that I had no choice but to do it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, why did you do that? Pretending to be an honor student, I mean. That’ll just make you look like a quiet kid with a communication disorder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know, right? As expected, you think so too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slumped her shoulders as she said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, the current atmosphere was more depressing than when we were talking about the other world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, do you still have trouble talking to other people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, so what?! You were the only person I could talk properly with back in the other world, so it can’t be helped that I’m also like this right now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then was then, now is now. You aren’t a witch anymore so people wouldn’t unconditionally hate you, would they? Besides, you have family and friends now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I can talk to my family just fine! F-Friends though… W-What are those? Can you eat them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you have no friends, huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shut it! People don’t change that easily, okay?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2489" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-726x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="726" height="1024" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-726x1024.jpeg 726w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-213x300.jpeg 213w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-768x1083.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1-1089x1536.jpeg 1089w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/00009-1.jpeg 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you just talk like how you normally talk to me, it’ll be easier for you to find some friends. Acting like an honor student would just make people avoid you, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard that advice from me, the witch furrowed her brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you on about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head, there was a confused expression in her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If they were to see my true self, they would obviously hate me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that as if it was an obvious truth, leaving me with no chance to rebuke her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me staring at her in silence, the witch turned away and dashed toward the classroom. Her black hair danced in the air following the movements of her body.</span></p>
