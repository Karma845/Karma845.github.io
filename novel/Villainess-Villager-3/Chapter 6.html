<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Villager A Brings the pervert</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, I took off from the airport of the elf village with Miri-chan. At first, she had a hard time, but soon she started sleeping on my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I managed to coax the excited Miri-chan to calm down, and sometimes I landed to get her in a good mood, but somehow I managed to get back to the yard of the Duke&#8217;s mansion before nightfall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the fact that I told them I would be back today or tomorrow, the head maid and the maid who took care of me came out as soon as I landed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they looked very suspicious when they saw me carrying the hooded Miri-chan in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the maid who took care of me seems to be looking at me accusingly. What on earth is going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Head maid-san, please tell the Duke I&#8217;m back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I walked into the Duke&#8217;s mansion, carrying the half-asleep Miri-chan in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been here. Certainly, this is where Liza-tan got married. And that head maid BBA, used to be cute too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I say, this pervert really is like the Wise Sage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contents are as expected&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But the BBA who was staring at Allen-shi was a BBA I didn&#8217;t know. Allen-shi, What did you do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have no idea. I&#8217;d like to hear it myself.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I&#8217;ve changed my tone back to normal. This pervert told me that it would be weird if I didn&#8217;t talk as usual, so I decided to go along with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, don&#8217;t you think she knows you&#8217;re just like me? Allen-shi, kidnapping is a crime? If you&#8217;ve got a record, why don&#8217;t you come clean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. And I&#8217;m definitely not like you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, while having this conversation, I hurried to Anna&#8217;s room while carrying Miri-chan, who was sleeping and making child-like sounds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we seemed to have rushed a bit too much, and Miri-chan woke up on the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I had a hard time pointing out the pictures displayed in the house and asking questions about what was that and what is this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- future practice, I hope. (p</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≧</span><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≦</span><span style="font-weight: 400">q))</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what a surprise! The pervert answered the questions in a way that even Miri-chan could easily understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you looking at me like that? When I was a human, I was called a wise man. This is just common sense.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why do you even know works of art even though you are a wise man?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s because if you answer the questions correctly, Lolis will be happy and say that you&#8217;re awesome!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert is proud to say so, but her motive is that. Moreover, because of her rebirth as a spirit of light, she looks like an outrageously beautiful girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gap between the two is quite terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, she plays the role of an ideal spirit of light in front of everyone except Miri-chan and me, so no one is aware of her abnormality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, he was just a pervert who continued to play the role of a selfless Wise Sage without his true nature getting discovered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh! Why are you only showing your nature so much in front of me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, I wonder why? Even I don&#8217;t know about it. But Allen-shi doesn&#8217;t mind me being like that, does he?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That means Allen-shi is also similar to myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s totally different!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, what is different?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of reaction will Miri-chan have when she realizes the true nature of this pervert?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite such anxiety, we made it to Anna&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knock knock</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, I&#8217;m entering.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knock on the door and then call out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please, come in.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was shocked for a moment when the reply came back from inside, but I quickly calmed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this is Elisabeth-san&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we opened the door and went inside, Elisabeth-san was sitting by the bedside, apparently taking care of Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the room with Miri in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh my? Who&#8217;s that child?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I close the door, I take Miri-chan in front of Elisabeth-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Elisabeth-sama, this is Miryl Leura-sama, the youngest daughter of the Queen of the Elf Village. And now, on her right shoulder, is the spirit of light, Rho-sama, who has made a contract with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I see! Nice to meet you. I am Elisabeth, Anastasia&#8217;s mother and the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s wife. Miryl Leura-sama, Rho-sama, thank you for coming to see my daughter today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Elisabeth-san showed her graceful and splendid ladylike bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, Anna&#8217;s mother? Oh, it&#8217;s Anna!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miri-chan stared at Elisabeth-san for some time, then found Anna, shook out of my embrace and dived into the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, wait, Miri-chan! Anna is now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, Miri-chan is gently touching Anna&#8217;s cheeks. Elisabeth-san smiles bitterly at such a situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why did you bring such a child here alone?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When I told the Queen about my plan, she asked me to take Miri-chan along with me so easily that I couldn&#8217;t believe it. I had no idea what was going on either.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to answer Elisabeth-san who was giving me a somewhat accusatory look, but then the pervert gave me a supplementary explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m under contract with Miri-tan, so I can&#8217;t leave her. So if I want to go somewhere, I have to take Miri-tan with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see. Umm, it seems that Rho-sama can&#8217;t stay away from her contractor Miryl Leura-sama too far.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But is this Liza-tan? As expected, she&#8217;s getting old.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san seemed to be convinced from my explanation, but beside her, the pervert quickly said something incredibly rude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, as expected, I can&#8217;t tell her about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s check her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the pervert flew to Anna&#8217;s bed, leaving me to ponder how to continue the conversation.</span></p>
