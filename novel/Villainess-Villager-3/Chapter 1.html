<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Villager A Rescues the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now that it&#8217;s broken, there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it, so I&#8217;ll just paint over it with the power of the magic sword.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who said this chanted a small incantation of some kind, and something black gushed out from the magic sword in Anna&#8217;s grip and clung to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon Anna slowly reached for me. Then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──── A……lle…n</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if Anna had said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t that Anna actually said that out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s eyes were unfocused, and it was hard to believe that she was seeing anything with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But sure enough, Anna reached out her hand towards me, even though I was supposed to be invisible with my </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s like knowing I&#8217;m there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as if she was saying that she wanted my help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really wanted to know how to undo it, but I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t let them do anything to Anna anymore!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fired two rounds of Kalashi, each, into the Crown Prince and the other man I thought was the mastermind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince got hit in the left chest and neck, and the other man got hit in the flank and left shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gah, ha~tsu. When… did you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man was surprised to see me, who he must have recognized as suddenly appearing. The Crown Prince, on the other hand, collapsed in a pool of blood and didn&#8217;t move an inch. He would probably die instantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot the man in the right knee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I shot him in the left knee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then shot him in his right shoulder as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There should be no resistance at all now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, this man is also bleeding profusely. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s going to last much longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I had secured my safety, I rushed over to Anna and stripped off the magical sword that released something black in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna! Hold on! Anna!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Anna&#8217;s eyes only looked at the void and did not respond to my call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You! What did you do to Anna?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled out the dagger at my waist and pointed it between the man&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha. What the hell. You&#8217;re that thing&#8217;s boyfriend, Allen? Unfortunately, you&#8217;re too late. There&#8217;s no will left in it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Answer the question!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm. I just broke its heart to let the magic sword control it. It seems that it liked you a lot, but you came too late. Well, okay. It&#8217;s all yours now. However, it can only be used to the extent of conceiving offspring. Hahaha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a fit of rage, I slashed this man across the face with my dagger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Guh, hahaha. But you can&#8217;t get out of here anyway. Why don&#8217;t you just give it a shot as a souvenir of the underworld?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he said that, I realized. Apparently, the gunshot was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear the footsteps of someone coming down the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ha~tsu. You killed His Highness. So be proud. Such a good dark side to be here, why&#8230;.that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, the man lost consciousness. Perhaps he had lost too much blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot him in the heart to finish him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, using wind magic, I decapitated them and stuffed them into the magic bag I had brought with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve killed too many people already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I know that my emotions don&#8217;t even fluctuate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel as if I&#8217;m dismantling a monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s only one thing I have to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking Anna back safely. That&#8217;s it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I must never mistake the order of what is important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what my mom said to me, and it&#8217;s what&#8217;s pushing me forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, using the surrounding walls as a material, I process a sheath, or perhaps a wrapping, that would enclose the entire sword and lower it to my waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It could be dangerous to carry it around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this way, I don&#8217;t have to touch the magic sword directly, and thanks to that man&#8217;s death, the black stuff that was emitting from the magic sword is already gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if this is left behind in the Empire, Anna might be targeted again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So to prevent that from happening, I should take it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was just about to run away with Anna &#8230;&#8230; a soldier arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness! Günther-sama!&#8221;</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out the Saiga and shoot at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the soldier down with a single blow, I took Anna on my back and ran as fast as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I ran up the stairs, I saw that many soldiers had already gathered there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shoot them or blow them away with wind magic to clear the enemy soldiers and look for an opportunity to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there were so many enemy soldiers that there was no room for that at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if I didn&#8217;t have Anna on my back, I could definitely get away with leaving her behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t make sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can no longer imagine my life without Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, little by little, by force, I made my way to the backyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Dra, Dragon!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Why are the dragons in the Imperial Capital?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, half go to subdue the dragons!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, yeah. It&#8217;s Melissa-chan and Jerome!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I switched from the Saiga to the Kalashi to sweep the area. Automatic rifles with an excellent rate of fire are easier to control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the reduced number of people, I easily suppressed the enemy soldiers, and when I re-carry Anna, I activate </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I reached the backyard where the Buitor Rev. was buried, taking Anna with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from my movements, they seemed to have expected me to come to the backyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were quite a few soldiers waiting for us there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since we are not visible, the situation is more favourable for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used my </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> skills to create a hand grenade version of the bomb I had been dropping from the Buitor Rev. and threw it at the middle of the soldiers in the backyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I crouched down, covered my ears with one arm, then opened my mouth and closed my eyes. Then, I used my other hand to cover one ear of Anna and covered her other ear with the soil deformed through</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The compressed air in the hand grenade exploded as it hit the ground and shattered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and saw that the soldiers in the courtyard had been caught in the explosion and collapsed, looking rather grotesque.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did another sweep with the Kalash, kicking out any soldiers that got in my way, and then ran with Anna on my back to the backyard where I had buried the Buitor Rev.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of taking out the Buitor Rev., I first built an earthen wall about three meters high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These will block the enemy soldiers&#8217; view and prevent them from attacking at the moment of takeoff when it&#8217;s most vulnerable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thereupon, I took the Buitor Rev. out from the bottom of the ground, put Anna on it, secured her, then I climbed aboard so that she gets covered from above, then activate the wind magic engine to start takeoff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, come on me! Don&#8217;t rush! Calm down!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertical takeoffs are especially nerve-wracking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gradually increased the power while balancing the output of each engine, and then the Buitor Rev., with Anna and me on board, softly floated into the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Where are the bandits!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Captain! There is a strange wall in the backyard!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The altitude of the Buitor Rev. soon exceeded the height of the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! That is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but shoot it down!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my haste, I start the propulsion engines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a sideways G-force, and the Buitor Rev. started to move forward little by little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the enemy soldiers were quicker to shoot the arrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fall down!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such a call, the arrow flew straight at me, the pilot, or rather at Anna, who was underneath me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted my body to take the arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu, u u~u!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow hit me in my left hip, and I felt a tremendous pain from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m bringing Anna home, no matter what!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keeping the wind magic engine running with my resolve, Buitor Rev., with us on board, began to gradually increase its altitude and speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no way the enemy soldiers would just sit back and let that happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get away. Shoot him!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such a shout, a large number of arrows were shot into the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crap!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment when I intuitively knew I was going to be shot down and prepared myself, a huge black body appeared in front of me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black giant caught all the flying arrows with its body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Jerome-kun!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A, Allen-san, are you okay? Wh-where&#8217;s your precious woman?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I managed to get her back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, then, should we go home? Or should we destroy everything?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not the point. Jerome-kun, what about the arrows? Are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It, It&#8217;s okay. I mean, my scales are still hard.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right, then let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Buitor Rev. with us on board was gaining speed and altitude rapidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were soon out of the reach of the Imperial Guard&#8217;s weapons and successfully escaped to a safe zone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I had enough time to spare, I turned around and looked at the Imperial Capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, a large amount of fire is rising around the area where the palace and large mansions, which were probably aristocratic districts, were lined up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, the tall building in the centre of town, which used to have several huge spires, has had all of its spires cut off and remodelled into a flat-roofed square building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Jerome-kun and Melissa-chan went wild, flashily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about Melissa-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, over there.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to my question, Jerome uses his head to point in a direction. When I look over there, Melissa-chan is flying towards me at a very fast speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank God. She is safe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san? I&#8217;m so glad. You got her back &#8230;..hmm? What&#8217;s wrong with her? Isn&#8217;t her appearance strange?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Melissa-chan and Jerome about what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So I couldn&#8217;t make it in time&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I, I can&#8217;t forgive them. I knew it, destroying half was not enough. I should have destroyed it all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right. I agree.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry. You can destroy it later. I need to get Anna to a doctor first. Also, my bad, but when you do it, give me a call.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..That&#8217;s right. I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, I rescued Anna and headed for Wishen, the territory of the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn! Because of me, because I was late!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn! Damn!</span></p>
