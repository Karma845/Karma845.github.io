<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (1)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there were a lot of things going on, but the villainess was finally taken by the empire, and in the winter she will attack as the last boss, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, how about I obtain the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Staff of Divine Guidance</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> first?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow the scenario is already messed up, and if only I had the staff, I should be able to become a saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blessing event was interrupted by that nerd, but since the game hasn&#8217;t been over yet, that means we didn&#8217;t really need the event, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m a genius for realizing that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. Now that I have decided that, I better hurry up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Karl-sama to help me find the abandoned church.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where a staff should be there for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, when we went to the abandoned church in the forest to the west of the royal capital, we found it easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be a lot of abandoned churches out there, but to easily find the one we&#8217;re looking for means, as expected, that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it must be the proof that I&#8217;m the heroine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the staff dedicated to the altar!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, God. The staff is just as beautiful as it looks in the CG.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did a little bit of acting to recreate the events of the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-This is?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a staff for Amy. Isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was surprised at how beautiful it was. Is it really okay for me to take it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It has to be. Amy must have been chosen by the staff.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leo &#8230;. u-umm, okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I picked up the staff, I heard a voice in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ O you who seek guidance! I recognize your strong desire and grant you strength. ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, my body was engulfed in light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the moment the light subsided, I was convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve become a special existence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufufu, I feel great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Karl-sama and the others are wide-eyed with surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, Amy? What was that light?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama says that and looks at me with a surprised expression. So does Leo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markus and Oscar are sitting down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, mouth agape and eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, did you all fall in love with me now that I&#8217;ve awakened as a saint?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama, I&#8217;ve been awakened as a Saint of Charity. Don&#8217;t you all think so too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think so too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama and Leo both said so in their replies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, Markus and Oscar would agree too, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to them, who were too surprised to respond, and smiled at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I think so too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I agree. I think so too. Saint of Charity is perfect for the gentle Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, I knew you two thought so too. I&#8217;m so happy!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, everyone!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, How about that! Now I&#8217;ll win!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, Karl-sama and his friends have been more kind to me than ever before. I wonder if it&#8217;s because I became a saint?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, sometimes it&#8217;s a little irritating, now more than ever, I&#8217;m getting stares from the guys whom I don&#8217;t even care about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as if my originally pretty face has been further refined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s annoying as hell. Don&#8217;t stare at me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, but you&#8217;re welcome to look at me if you&#8217;re handsome, okay?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d rather be seen more. A woman becomes beautiful when she is watched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Is it me or her senses are messed up?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I don&#8217;t know why, but ever since I became a Saint of Charity, people have started to listen to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, I was supposed to go to Westerdale and have a hard time convincing people, that kind of setting was there, but it&#8217;s a little strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have all the options for that perfectly memorized, but was it wasted?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was said that the Saint of Charity&#8217;s prayers and words for peace moved people&#8217;s hearts, and since the scenario is so messed up, I wonder if lots of stuff got skipped just for me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I&#8217;m sure it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, all we have to do is run away to Westerdale if the royal capital is attacked. Then we can ask Claude to send an army to help us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I thought, but then something happened that I didn&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, it seems they fought the Est Empire and won. What does that mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the family of the villainess who was supposed to be executed in the game is still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, I heard that the nerd took the head of the crown prince of the Est Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did he go to get his beloved villainess back? I&#8217;m going to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? So, what happened to the villainess?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if she&#8217;s okay, there should be at least a rumour going around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. So it must have been too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she dead, or was her body so mangled and destroyed that she could never be seen again?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, she might have already been fascinated by the magic sword and become a dark knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, that&#8217;s too bad. Fufufu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, it feels good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainous nerdy character who has interfered with me so much will lose the villainess and kneel before me, the original heroine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aha, aha, ahahaha.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I thought. It&#8217;s still weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I heard that the villainess&#8217;s family has defied the king and stopped selling wheat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is rebellion, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked Karl-sama about it, he bravely volunteered to subdue them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So cool!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew my Karl-sama was the best. He says he&#8217;s going to reclaim the land of Centraren from the hands of the rebels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe this is the ending to defeat the villainess&#8217;s family?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that they&#8217;ve already defeated the Est Empire, so I wonder if this is all right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Must be so!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, you see, I told Karl-sama and the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That the Est Empire should defeat the rebels with everything in its power because their Crown Prince has died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they both praised me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s exactly as you say, or as expected of the Saint of Charity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufufu. With this, the King has approved of me being the Saint of Charity. Though the way the King looks at me is a bit disgusting, I guess it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, even a King can&#8217;t keep his eyes off a popular woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a given, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, it feels good.</span></p>
