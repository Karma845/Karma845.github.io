<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Villager A Celebrates the Villainess&#8217;s Birthday</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked the maid to help me get ready and put on my formal attire. I had my hair done and took the present.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, I&#8217;m all set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I went to my mother&#8217;s room to pick her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, ever since the Duke approved my marriage to Anna, my mother is also living in the Duke&#8217;s mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason is that the mother of the Duchess&#8217;s fiancé is also a target and needs to be protected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Certainly, that&#8217;s true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aristocratic society is a troublesome one, but it is a path that I have prepared myself to take. I guess I have no choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about ten minutes of waiting, my mother came out of her room wearing a dress. She seemed to be struggling with the heels and the dress, which she was not used to, but she looked different from my usual gentle mother, and I thought she was very beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my mother&#8217;s hand and escorted her to Anna&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid opened the door for me, and we went in. The Duke, Elisabeth-san, and Friedrich-san were already there, chatting happily beside Anna, who was still asleep in bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am late.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for having me here today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom greeted them politely, while I was my usual self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha. It&#8217;s not even time, yet we&#8217;re all here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at my watch and saw that the Duke was right, it was still 10 minutes to go. I guess everyone was looking forward to Anna&#8217;s birthday after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s start a little early.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Duke said this, he coughed once and then spoke softly to Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, happy 17th birthday!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the words of the Duke as a cue, we quietly convey our congratulations, one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Anna. I thought I&#8217;d give you a proper update today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke took Anna&#8217;s hand and said so, a look of prayer on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, your Allen has become your fiancée.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when Anna continued to sleep like a statue, I nodded my head in disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Besides, we&#8217;ve prepared a lot of Anna&#8217;s favourite foods for you today. Eat as much as you like, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, he points to the gorgeous dishes lined up on the table, but Anna didn&#8217;t respond and continued to sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Happy birthday, Anna. I&#8217;ve prepared a homemade cake that you&#8217;ve loved since you were a child.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, happy birthday. I got you that white horse you&#8217;ve been asking for. It&#8217;s outside. How about it? Wouldn&#8217;t you like to ride it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, happy birthday. And thank you so much for choosing my son, who is still lacking in many areas. I heard that you like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san gave her a memorable cake, Friedrich-san&#8217;s gave her a horse that Anna wanted of which I had no idea, and my mother handed her a wrapped confectionery, but Anna was still asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next is my turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Happy birthday, Anna. I&#8217;m sorry I put you through all this because I wasn&#8217;t good enough. Here, this is the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight Sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I promised to you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I pulled out the sword and showed Anna the beautiful, slender, sky-blue blade. Her beautiful face was reflected in the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently put the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight Sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Anna&#8217;s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dazzling light shone from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight Sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Anna!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly reached out and grabbed Anna&#8217;s hand, but it was so dazzling that I closed my eyes and turned away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just as the light went out, I heard a faint voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A, lle&#8230;.n?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the voice I had been waiting to hear for so long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been hoping to happen for so long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t control my emotions and hugged the sleeping Anna as hard as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna! Anna!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears flowed endlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, damn it. Even though I was supposed to smile!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna answered me gently in a weak voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;len. Don&#8217;t, cry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, she put her left hand, which was not holding the sword, around my back, but it was terribly weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel joy and security, and at the same time, my heart is tightened with sadness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, I&#8217;m not letting you go, ever. I won&#8217;t let you go alone, no matter what anyone says.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A&#8230;..llen&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hugged each other. But after a while, I heard a coughing sound from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kissed on her forehead and slowly and unwillingly moved away from Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fa, ther&#8230;..Mo&#8230;.ther, Bro&#8230;ther, this&#8230;is?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it&#8217;s hard to speak, as she called the three people with a weak voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh, Anna. It&#8217;s good to have you back. This is the territorial residence. Anna! Anna!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the Duke hugged Anna while crying, and Elisabeth-san and Friedrich-san also hugged Anna while crying in the same way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we all cried, and then it took us quite a while to calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Once again, happy birthday Anna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke&#8217;s words of congratulations were answered in a firm tone by Anna, who was sitting on the bed with only her upper body raised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, she drank a little water to moisten her throat, which helped her to speak more or less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke continued to speak to Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna. Allen rescued you from the imperial palace alone after you were kidnapped and brought you back here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Allen. You&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I really wanted to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna looks happy and a little sad.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re worried when you heard that I did it all by myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, the man you chose is a great man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Father&#8230;. by that&#8230;..?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna raises her eyebrows in surprise. I&#8217;m so happy just to see such a surprised face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, as promised, the Duke has acknowledged me. Will you marry me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kneel at the bedside and take Anna&#8217;s hand, proposing once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I softly wiped the tears from her cheeks as she nodded, then gently hugged and kissed her.</span></p>
