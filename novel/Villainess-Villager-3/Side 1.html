<h3>Side &#8211; Centraren King</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since the Est Empire declared war on us, I&#8217;ve been hearing nothing but bad reports. I&#8217;m not feeling well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man with an unfavourable expression came to report today as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty, we have received a report from the messenger on the state of the war.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm. Tell me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Our fortresses have fallen one after another against the Est Empire that has invaded our territory in Bruseni. Only five percent of the Bruseni region remains under our control.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh! What are they doing? Why weren&#8217;t they prepared?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard the report, my anger reached a climax, and I slammed the desk as hard as I could. With a thump, I felt a pain in my fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, umm, the application itself was submitted six months ago, but it has been delayed due to procedural problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who was that? Who delayed it so much?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Now see who the tumour of this kingdom is.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could they have stopped such an important application? If this is not punished, the country will be in a mess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, all the applications have been rejected &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So who was it that was doing such a thing!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-well, saying that is too much for me&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is this foolish man talking about? If I don&#8217;t know who did it, I can&#8217;t punish him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You, just tell me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Say it! If you don&#8217;t say it, I&#8217;ll decapitate you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, It was Your Majesty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What did you say! Are you trying to tell me that I&#8217;m such a fool?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless of the situation, it&#8217;s outrageous of him to hold me responsible for this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, guards. Take this impudent man away!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I gave the order, this foolish man was taken away. He will be executed soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. Speaking of foolish men, there was a misunderstood student who didn&#8217;t know what he was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even if he was somewhat skilled, he should be a corpse if he went to Bruseni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I don&#8217;t care about that misunderstood student, but I do have a big problem with idiots who don&#8217;t understand such things being students at a high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All right, when this war is over, I&#8217;ll make a new law so that they won&#8217;t be able to enrol such fools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmm, that&#8217;s good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a message for Your Majesty. The southern kingdom of Xaus has attacked. The Duke of Ramslett has sent a request for help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He&#8217;s back in the territory now. Tell him to mind his own business.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But the number of enemies is said to be 100,000, and until now, there have been requests for help from &#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">100,000 troops? Isn&#8217;t it almost the entire army that the Kingdom of Xaus can mobilize for an expedition? There was no way that was possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably a plan to reduce the damage to his own troops as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, that man said something troublesome about his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, to become upset over a broken engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I can understand the trouble of having fewer pieces when they go unaccounted for. But then again, that&#8217;s what happens when you can&#8217;t educate your own daughter properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I don&#8217;t understand why she would voluntarily ride in a carriage of the Est soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the result of her sitting in her position as a Duchess and scavenging for men. This is why my son, who has the blessing of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, abandoned her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s outrageous that he would shift the blame for this on my son, who has the blessing of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, he also made a big deal about the Jade Seal. I just let my son, the next King, use it for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I say it&#8217;s not a problem, it&#8217;s not a problem. I can&#8217;t believe he can&#8217;t even understand that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them are idiots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, at present, it is a fact that it would be a problem without the Duke of Ramslett. The army is strong there, and it is the largest breadbasket of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, it would be better to reduce the power of the Duke of Ramslett here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tell Duke Ramslett. No reinforcements will be sent. Tell him to defend his territory at all costs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a message for Your Majesty. In the Bruseni region, the war situation has improved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that true!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;According to reports, a young man by the name of Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett who was ordered by His Majesty, is in a series of victories. This young man is also said to be a student, So, Your Majesty&#8217;s wise decision is being praised.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmm? Did something like that happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, maybe that was the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A good politician will always make good decisions. This is a common occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I chose him. Therefore, he is not the adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, but of mine, the Royal family&#8217;s adventurer. Do you understand?&#8221; (T/N:- In your dreams.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahaha. I don&#8217;t know who you are, but I&#8217;m going to use you up as much as I can! Adventurer!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a message for Your Majesty. We have recaptured the fortified city of Cardassia in the Bruseni region. It is said that the adventurer sent by Your Majesty played a leading role in this as well. As expected of Your Majesty. We are all in awe of your wisdom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm. That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right, I feel good today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll give you a reward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! Thank you for your kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reward and motivate good subordinates. This is also the role of the king.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I often get scared of my ability, and I still am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a message for Your Majesty. The Duke of Ramslett has defeated 100,000 troops from the Kingdom of Xaus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As I thought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duke&#8217;s army should be 10,000, or even 20,000 if he mobilized it without thinking. There was no way that can defeat 100,000 troops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This means that the initial figure of 100,000 was probably a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, it&#8217;s better to make Duke Ramslett, who is caught up in the moment, leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I was about thinking else. Tell Duke Ramslett that it was good work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! And as for the adventurer who was chosen by His Majesty and played a major role in the settlement of the Bruseni region&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The Duke of Ramslett has requested the negotiations on the reward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What did you say? He has some nerve to steal my adventurer. Very well. Tell Duke Ramslett to come himself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know who this adventurer is, but the Est was defeated because of his assistance, so our army is mostly intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even if the Duke of Ramslett had pushed Xaus back, he would not have come away unscathed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it&#8217;s about time to cut him off. There is no need for such a vassal anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the problem is how to govern the South after I cut him off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I began to think about my future plans.</span></p>
