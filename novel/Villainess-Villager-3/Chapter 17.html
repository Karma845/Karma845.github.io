<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; Villager A is Saved by the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear Anna calling me. But it&#8217;s kind of cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is cold, yet somehow it is not cold even though it should be cold. In fact, it feels warm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is the meaning of this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Anna calling me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then my body, which should have been cold, became warmer and warmer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was startled by the voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes, there in front of me was Anna with tears in her eyes and a relieved look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How? Dream?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Stupid. It can&#8217;t be a dream. You&#8217;re alive, Allen. I&#8217;m glad. Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the warmth of Anna who hugged me tightly was transmitted, and the nice scent of Anna spread all over my nose. And it was irresistible and lovely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only then did I realize that my life was connected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Anna and the Duke, no, Gerhard-san, Anna healed my wounds. She said that all of a sudden she could hear voices and was able to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she was given the blessing of〖Ice Saint〗, also the blessing of〖Ice Magic〗disappeared and she had the skill of 【Holy Ice Magic】. I can imagine the cause for this, but just to be sure, I had her appraised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">〖Sky Knight〗: The blessing of〖Knight〗 given to those who wish to protect people is evolved to the 『Sky Knight sword』. In addition to aptitude as a knight, aptitude for wind magic is greatly increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">〖Ice Saint〗: A woman of deep love and noble spirit who has been given a holy blessing and is a user of ice magic. She is able to handle holy power through the ice, and her aptitude for Holy Ice Magic is greatly increased. When given this blessing, the 【Holy Ice Magic】 skill is granted, greatly increasing one&#8217;s aptitude for Holy Ice Magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Holy Ice Magic】: The blessing or skill of ice magic evolves when its owner becomes the 〖Ice Saint〗. You are able to manipulate ice that is imbued with holy power. It completely encompasses the skill of 【Ice Magic】.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That seems to be the case.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A wo-woman like me is a saint&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s expression is one of pure bewilderment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Maybe, but Anna was blessed by the Spirit of Light, right? So, I think such a strong wish of Anna&#8217;s was fulfilled by this 『Staff of Divine Guidance』.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna still feels like it doesn&#8217;t feel right when she is told that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But thank you, Anna. You&#8217;re the reason I&#8217;m still alive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, yeah. Yes, it is. I thought my heart was going to stop, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want that to happen again, okay!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, if you understand it, that&#8217;s fine then.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna was so cute when she said that, that I hugged her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, cough. It&#8217;s fine that you and your fiancé are getting along so well, but can we move on?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just started flirting with Anna, but Gerhard-san stopped me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gununu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, what&#8217;s this thing about witches?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. When I appraised that woman, Amy von Brayes, I saw the blessing of〖Witch of Envy〗. And the effect is to increase her attractiveness as a woman, and also her aptitude for the skill 【Kotodama】 increases.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;【Kotodama】, is it? I&#8217;ve heard of it in fairy tales, but it&#8217;s a very nasty skill when it&#8217;s used in real life. In short, if you say something to someone who reacts even slightly to your tricks, you can corrupt them in the blink of an eye.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does that mean that she has been enticing those five people like that for a long time?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna said with a frown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I think she probably only recently acquired that power. Moreover, if she had it before, the academy would have been in a lot worse shape.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in light of the strange situation at that school, it is undeniable that she may have activated the weak 【Kotodama】 skill without any blessing or skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Certainly, it&#8217;s no wonder that that woman would want all men to serve her. And that means Allen, too!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps imagining the situation, cold air began to leak from Anna&#8217;s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Woah, yandere Anna. Looking forward to Manga. (❤ ω ❤))</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Anna, that&#8217;s not the case. Rest assured? I&#8217;m just Anna&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, somehow cold sweat runs down my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would never tell her that I didn&#8217;t think she was dangerous at first because she looked good that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have a desire for ruin in the first place, and above all, I&#8217;m sure I would hurt Anna if I said such a thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yeah. That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it? There&#8217;s no way Allen would fall for a woman like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. My only beloved woman is Anna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that then took Anna&#8217;s hand and looked into her eyes. Anna&#8217;s expression suddenly relaxes and a slight blush appears on her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, cough. Are you two good?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;Ah.&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were brought back from our worlds again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh well. Anyway, that witch is not good. If we leave someone with such dangerous abilities unattended, the world will be in trouble. I will issue a strong order once again.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerhard-san left the room when he said that.</span></p>
