<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Villager A Oversees the Battle With the Villainess</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we watched from the top of a small hill, they launched a catapult attack on the north wall of Lurden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t told how they would do it, but I never expected such a forceful push out of the blue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is clear, however, is that the Second Prince&#8217;s faction, or rather Duke Schleistein, apparently has no intention of taking Lurden back intact, but only wants to be able to drop it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, against that catapult&#8217;s attack, the soldiers of the Lurden garrison went for a charge attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps they are soldiers who have gone crazy because of Amy&#8217;s brainwashing. Common sense dictates that in such a situation, the soldiers should respond by using catapults, fire arrows, ballista, etc. to destroy the catapults, or hide the soldiers in the woods and sneak up to attack them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s terrible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna frowns as she watches such a situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think listening to Amy&#8217;s orders has become their number one priority.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it. Even a soldier is one of the people. To use them and throw them away like that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she can order these things with impunity is what makes her a witch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the expression on Anna&#8217;s face is complicated when she muttered that. She was thinking of her people, including the soldiers who were being sent there to die in vain, so perhaps it is not so easy to separate the two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my attention back to the battlefield, I see hundreds of soldiers charging in formation with shields at the ready. The Second Prince&#8217;s faction is also intercepting with bows and arrows, but the sight of them charging without any regard for the cost of their lives must be terrifying, to say the least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Second Prince&#8217;s faction is gradually being overwhelmed by the spirited soldiers of Centraren, who use even the corpses of their friends as shields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, they succeeded in attacking one of the catapults and destroying it. The man who succeeded in destroying the catapult thrust his fist high into the sky and shouted in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Long live the Saint!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice reached here, which should have been quite a distance away. It can be seen that the Second Prince&#8217;s army was further pressured by the voice and the turmoil was spreading.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the army of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction, which had been slow to intercept, were seized and got another of their catapults destroyed. When all the catapults were silenced, the gate opened and a large number of cavalrymen charged in. The attack was probably aimed at the frightened people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The archers and magicians of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction attempt to intercept them, but they are unable to slow their momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The infantry units immediately moved forward to intercept the cavalry and responded by forming a dense formation to intercept the cavalry. However, they could not hold them off, as they were not heavily armed infantry. The infantry was easily broken through by the enemy cavalry, and the front line was torn apart as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the Centraren side sees this, they send out more soldiers. They seem to be mainly infantry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the smoke signal rose from the main camp. Apparently, it&#8217;s already time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, it&#8217;s sooner than I thought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It is the decision of the general. It can&#8217;t be helped. Allen, let&#8217;s do this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna then began chanting. I had nothing special to do, so I gently put my hand on Anna&#8217;s back to let her know I was rooting for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Maximum Holy Snow Awakening!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna casts the spell and began to send magic power into the ice spirit stones embedded in the ground. Then, all the ice stones arranged in a circle with the royal capital at the centre begin to glow with magic power all at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the area around the royal capital was enveloped in a blizzard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon the blizzard stopped, and there they were, soldiers with their heads covered in snow like snowmen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snow covering the soldier&#8217;s heads collapses the next instant, and they all come to their senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They seem to be looking around and trying to understand why they are here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, they soon surrendered and became prisoners of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The army of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction saw this and charged toward the castle gate. All the soldiers guarding the gates who had been outside would have come to their senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the soldiers who were guarding inside the building were naturally unaffected, and the gates were still tightly closed by Amy&#8217;s fanatics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The army of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction brought out a battering ram and tried to destroy the castle gate. However, the guards lower the useless soldiers, and then the other fanatics stand on the wall and begin to attack the army of the Second Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Could this be, the army of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction is weak?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it. The skill of the soldiers themselves is not bad. However, the person who is giving instructions is too terrible. I understand that it is difficult to aim for a long-term battle in such a situation, but to catch a big fish the bait was probably too small. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the troops attached to the castle gate were repelled. Seeing this, the soldiers of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction began to retreat to the main camp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn, it can&#8217;t be helped. We have no choice but to come out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Allen, Jerome, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Lea-leave it to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we got on Jerome-kun and took off for the royal castle.</span></p>
