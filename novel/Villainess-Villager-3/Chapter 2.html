<h3>Chapter 2  &#8211; Villager A Overruns the Xaus Kingdom Army</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We flew through the night, and by daybreak, we were in the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Already below us were the fields of autumn, where wheat has not been planted yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the scale of the map is correct, we should be able to reach Wishen, the territorial capital where the Duke is supposed to be, in about an hour.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was thanks to the Buitor Rev. that we were able to cross the mountain and the forest, again a mountain and a forest, and then jumped over untouched undeveloped lands.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though we had already passed through the Valley of the Flying Dragons, both Jerome and Melissa-chan were accompanying us.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve got some really good friends. I can&#8217;t thank these guys enough.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the important thing is that Anna is sleeping peacefully after we took off on the Buitor Rev.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her beautiful sleeping face, which I love so much, hasn&#8217;t changed at all.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It took me so long to come to your aid. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently stroked Anna&#8217;s hair and dropped a kiss on her forehead.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked ahead, I saw a large town. I checked it against the map, and there was no doubt that it was the capital.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We reached the sky above the territorial capital in no time, but we found many people gathered to the south of it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked with my binoculars and saw that the flag of the Duke of Ramslett was flying on the side near the capital, and the flag of the Kingdom of Xaus was flying on the other side.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the guys from the Est Empire said, the Kingdom of Xaus seems to have invaded the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that they are being pressed by the territorial capital must mean that they are in a predicament.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, there are quite a lot of men on the side of the Xaus Kingdom.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, wait, isn&#8217;t that a little too much?</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are probably 10,000 or so people here at most. But the other side seems to have ten times that many.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how they managed to pull out without being overtaken.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on here? Why are humans fighting like this?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because they&#8217;re fools, But the one who is defending is Anna&#8217;s father. So I&#8217;m going to kick off the other side.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Melissa heard what I said, she had a look of &#8216;Good grief&#8217; on her face.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, eh? Th-then we too&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that. Besides, Allen-san, will you be okay alone?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m grateful, as expected of Melissa-chan.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, I&#8217;m sorry. Please be patient a little more.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded to Melissa-chan, and then gently stroked Anna&#8217;s cheek as she continued to sleep.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was just my imagination, but I felt that Anna smiled gently.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I increased the wind output of the magic engine and sped up to move above the Xaus Kingdom army, then dropped bombs one after another.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I bomb across the enemy lines, there is no danger of misfiring on the allies. I can do whatever I want, just like I did in Bruseni.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bombs that fell exploded, and just like the Est soldiers in Bruseni, the Xaus soldiers were caught in the explosions one after another and lost their fighting ability.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unlike the time with Bruseni, my heart was not disturbed in the least.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I guess that&#8217;s true. After all, I have done so many things like this over and over.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself and continued bombing to annihilate the Xaus soldiers.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a little further on, I spotted a camp with the flag of the Kingdom of Xaus and two other flags that I didn&#8217;t know.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this is the position where the commander of the enemy forces is located.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, I&#8217;m going to drop a lot of bombs on that position as well.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bombardment was still going on as I moved, so the ground looked exactly like a copy of the destruction I caused.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, the Royal Army of Xaus also apparently realized that there was something above them and that it was dropping something.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers were desperately shooting arrows at me, but of course, they couldn&#8217;t reach me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I ran up and down the battlefield and bombed the hell out of them for about 30 minutes.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the troops that were crossing swords with the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army gradually began to show signs of breaking down.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was my observation from the air, but it seemed that the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army was superior in terms of the fighting ability of each and every soldier.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, the army of the Xaus Kingdom has adopted a strategy of crushing the difference in individual strength with the advantage of overwhelming numbers.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army probably would&#8217;ve pulled out well without fighting to destroy the siege.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, the army of the Xaus Kingdom seems to have come up with a strategy of relying on their numbers and pushing head-on.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the front line troops are destroyed, they are forced to fall back and push out other troops from the rear. By doing this, they seemed to be gradually lowering the morale of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army and reducing their numbers by putting them in a situation where no matter how many they defeated, more enemies would appear.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under such circumstances, I thoroughly bombed and destroyed the rear troops and the commander&#8217;s camp.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Losing the advantage of numbers and the orders of their commanders, the Xaus Kingdom&#8217;s army collapsed within ten minutes and began to run away in the blink of an eye.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched this, I spotted the Duke riding his horse in the centre of his army.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly start descending to speak with the Duke.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll cover for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Melissa-chan.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Melissa-chan and Jerome huddled around the Buitor Rev. as if to protect it, and together we lowered our altitude.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army must have noticed that there was something up there.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s a different story if there are 2 dragons involved. Moreover, they are both Sky Dragons, who are the Kings of the Sky.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights around the Duke are tightening their perimeter to protect him, and are ready with their bows &amp; arrows and shields to intercept us.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, whether the Duke is stopping them or because he knows that if he makes a move, they will die, they are not attacking.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu. That&#8217;s pretty wise, as expected of the father of Allen-san&#8217;s partner.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan said this with satisfaction and landed on the ground first. Then Jerome landed next to her, and finally, my Buitor Rev. landed between them.</span></p>
