<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (3)</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahh, hahh, Karl-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, hang in there. We&#8217;re almost across the border.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. Then we can return to King&#8217;s Landing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran like hell. I didn&#8217;t think it would come to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leo and Oscar helped us escape. We must live to repay them for that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. No matter how much that nerd cheats, there&#8217;s no way he could have survived those wounds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even the villainess should be easily defeated if it&#8217;s Leo. She didn&#8217;t look like she was in very good shape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, still&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can see it. It&#8217;s a village!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Did we make it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We have left the land occupied by the rebels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank goodness&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I felt relieved, I lost my strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Karl-sama carried me like a princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kya! I, I..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, Amy. I&#8217;m doing this because I want to. I&#8217;m sorry I made you walk all the way out here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head adorably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m happy to have both Karl-sama and Markus with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said this with an upward glance, then looked down a little and said with determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go! For both of them too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We must protect Amy for both of them.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at their words and managed to escape back to the royal capital with my life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, God. What&#8217;s really going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is the second prince escaping when I&#8217;ve just become a Saint of Charity? What&#8217;s more, the struggle for succession is happening at a time like this!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Be prepared northern aristocrats who oppose me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I heard that the front with the Est Empire is being pushed back somehow. What&#8217;s going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the soldiers in this country a bit feckless after all?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s it! I came up with a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit of a challenge, but let&#8217;s go with this strategy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, I have to go to ask Karl-sama for help as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s great of Amy to take it upon herself to get involved in this kind of activity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really, since becoming the Saint of Charity, Amy has grown so fast that I think we will be left behind!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh no. It&#8217;s not like that. That&#8217;s too many compliments. Besides, I&#8217;m a saint of charity, so this much is only natural.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu. I don&#8217;t think I can capture any more, but I&#8217;m getting more and more favourable feedback from both of you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Amy, here we are.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Karl-sama escorted me into a large room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, there are a lot of soldiers here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama, facing the soldiers, started giving a speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you all for gathering here. As you know, our country has the Est Empire in the east, the rebel former Duke Ramslett in the south, and in the north, my foolish brother, who has been tricked into rebellion by the rebel Duke Schleistein.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu. That&#8217;s just like Karl-sama, isn&#8217;t it? His speech is so cool too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But it is because of your efforts that the royal capital and its people are able to live in peace!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Uoooooooo&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So there! Our King&#8217;s beloved Saint, Amy, has come to encourage you. She has offered to encourage each of you out of her compassionate heart. Please take your turn, line up, and speak with Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Uoooooooo&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, how is it? This is Operation Saint, where you can come to see me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers have already lined up in plain sight. Now all that is left is to handle this like a handshake event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m Daniel. I&#8217;m a knight apprentice. U-Umm, you look beautiful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Daniel-sama. You are so good. Being an apprentice is hard, isn&#8217;t it? Please do your best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! I&#8217;ll do my best!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then next!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait a minute. I will give my blessing to Daniel-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I shook the hand of this dumb guy named Daniel and looked at him with upturned eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, cute. He got all red in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, the Saint of Charity, is always rooting for you. Please protect everyone. Daniel-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Daniel seemed dreamy as he left. After that, Daniel was a total fan of mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, next!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m Oliver. I&#8217;m a knight apprentice. Oh, well, you look nice.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here on out, it was pretty much the same conversation over and over again. It took a while, but it doesn&#8217;t matter when you think you are dealing with potatoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus, they&#8217;re knights. Thanks to the fact that they&#8217;re properly trained, they&#8217;re a little bit strong, but it helps that there are no creeps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think I would have been able to do the handshake event for such a long time if I had been dealing with creepy fat guys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, thank you for your hard work.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Amy, that was great. I see the morale of the soldiers has been boosted considerably.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh no, I just did what I could do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your humbleness is also wonderful, Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook hands with various soldiers every day. Then it was over in no time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, I&#8217;ve also healed the injured, and I&#8217;m already the beautiful and gentle Saint of Charity Amy-sama among the soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During this time, a knight apprentice was seriously discussing how to help Amy-sama, you know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made me laugh. I think of you guys as nothing more than potatoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, work for me, will you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the power of the Saint of Charity is really convenient, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, prayer and words weakened the last boss, the villainess. And now &#8230;&#8230; oh, Leo should have defeated her, so it won&#8217;t happen this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leo &#8230; you&#8217;ll come back properly, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh no. I got sidetracked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, there&#8217;s the church. If I can get them to recognize me, there won&#8217;t be anyone in the country who won&#8217;t recognize me as a Saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you know what? They are stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say no because I haven&#8217;t performed any miracles, or shown any proof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How can they not see that my existence is proof?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to deal with people who are not very smart. Really.</span></p>
