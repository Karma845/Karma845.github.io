<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Villager A Prepares for the Decisive Battle</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Duke Schleistein has accepted the terms.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. We were able to negotiate peacefully, without any bellows or crossing swords.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Looks like you did well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thanks for your advice. Also, on my way home, I saw what&#8217;s going on in the royal capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, what was the state of the battle?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is no siege, and for now the standoff seems to be continuing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, there&#8217;s a possibility that the empire won&#8217;t be able to keep the expeditionary force and pull back. What about the effects of that witch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. From the looks of it, it seemed that 10 to 20% of the residents were already under her influence. She went out of her way to perform healing magic in public places, and also gave speeches. I think she probably put those who could produce such things under her control.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not good.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerhard-san&#8217;s expression, which had been speaking so matter-of-factly, turned quite grim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, to be clear, this situation is quite bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy is originally very good looking because she is the heroine of the game. She is not just the best in her class, but one in 10,000, or something like that. And now, with the blessing of〖Witch of Envy〗, her attractiveness as a woman has been enhanced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so far, the dim-witted Amy has been thinking and acting on her own, but what would happen if someone who knows how to showcase, write scenarios and move Amy, a superb pawn, gets added to the mix?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No doubt, the number of people under Amy&#8217;s influence will explode. The evidence of this is that in some of the speaking engagements I&#8217;ve seen, there were quite a few women in attendance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps those who are producing it, regardless of what their original intentions were, are now completely under Amy&#8217;s influence, and are now exercising their wisdom for the sake of the beloved &#8220;Saint of Charity&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So what does Allen think of it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Perhaps, but I believe that Centraren will depose the Imperial army. After that, Duke Schleistein&#8217;s Second Prince faction will fight for the defeat of the witch as a cause.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So I&#8217;ll be making preparations with Anna in the meantime.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Preparations, you say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. We are going to the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain to improve Anna&#8217;s level. Because that&#8217;s the best place to level up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmm, be careful.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess they trust me these days, and they don&#8217;t object to these things anymore. Anna&#8217;s strength has recovered to a level where it is no longer a problem, and I want to get her level up to at least 30 while I&#8217;m at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the two blessings of〖Sky Knight〗and〖Ice Saint〗, Anna should be unstoppable by anyone if she properly levels up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to be ready this time for anything in the upcoming decisive battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But no matter how much you want to do it for Anna, don&#8217;t do anything that will cause you to throw away your own life, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. That was the last time something like that is going to happen. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I left Gerhard-san&#8217;s office and went to a certain place in the town of Wishen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Unseasonal snow is falling on the southern island. It will rain tomorrow because it&#8217;s falling from the day before yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gachari</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said the same unintelligible words and the door was opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once inside, the small, six-tatami-mat store is crammed with dubious items, just as it was in Lurden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the counter in the back sits a familiar old woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, welcome. What are you looking for today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;10 large ice stones.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice spirit stone is a special item that amplifies ice-based magic by processing the magic stone of ice-based monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, the magic stone of the sky dragon was used to make an oversized wind spirit stone, which was then used to inflict a wind magic ranged attack on the villainess who became the last boss and the Imperial Army.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it is at this Rulu store that they can do the processing for us. It costs quite a bit of money in addition to using precious magic stones. Of course, this is also used by those who pay the bills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As many as 10 large ice stones? I&#8217;m sorry, but I only have one large ice stone in stock. It&#8217;s not so easy to get Blizzard Phoenix class magic stone, you know.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took 9 Blizzard Phoenix magic stones out of my magic bag and put them on the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can you prepare with this? I need it as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may have been the first time I saw the surprised face of this old woman, who usually does not change her complexion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-It&#8217;s fine. As expected of Allen von Ramslett-sama. I didn&#8217;t think that little boy would become such a man. I&#8217;ll have it ready in two weeks, 3.6 million Rams, is that okay? &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rams is the unit of currency of the Ramslett Kingdom. The name, of course, comes from the Rams of Ramslett. At the moment, they are exchanged at the rate of 1 cent = 1 rams, but who knows what will happen in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there is no guarantee that the currency of the Centraren Kingdom, which is certain to lose territory and power, will retain its current value.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I have already converted almost all of my cent assets to rams assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve also rewritten my affiliation as an adventurer to Wishen, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about not having the cent assets.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I left the Rulu store.</span></p>
