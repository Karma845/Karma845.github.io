<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Villager A Goes to Express Gratitude with the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, I headed with Anna to the Valley of the Flying Dragon and came to the Temple of the Winds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen-san, h-hello. Ah, your important person is also doing well. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I landed the Buitor Rev. on the snowy plaza in front of the temple, Jerome-kun jumped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Long time no see! Huh? Where&#8217;s Melissa-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, um, you know, inside.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s get in. Come on, Anna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, we followed Jerome into the temple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when we entered the temple, the inside of the temple was unexpectedly warm, unlike the cold outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, welcome, Allen-san. And your important woman is doing well, is she? That&#8217;s great.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan laid down a large amount of grass in the temple, curled up on it, and turned only her head toward us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, thanks to the two of you. Anna got well, so we came to report and express our gratitude for your kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s very kind of you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too, it was thanks to Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun&#8217;s help that I was able to save Anna. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ll never forget what you did for us. We were just returning the favour.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, Allen-san. It&#8217;s thanks to you Allen-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Still, I&#8217;m glad. Also, she&#8217;s my fiancée, Anastasia. We&#8217;re getting married next fall.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I introduce Anna as such and bring her forward. Then Anna took a firm ladylike bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My name is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. I am Allen&#8217;s fiancée. I apologize for not being able to greet you properly the last time we met. Melissa-sama, Jerome-sama, I heard that you both helped to rescue me from the empire and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry that it has taken me so long to thank you despite the fact that&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s long, you know? Um, is it okay with Anna-chan? If Allen-san&#8217;s precious woman is saved, that&#8217;s all that matters. We didn&#8217;t do much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Melissa-san&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, yes. When you are going to destroy the Imperial capital, you should tell us, right? I won&#8217;t allow you to sneak off and destroy it, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jerome-kun also nods his head excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Melissa-chan, I don&#8217;t have that plan for now anyway. Because I killed the two masterminds. Well, that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve forgiven them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Well, anyway, I can&#8217;t go now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be mom and dad before Allen-san and Anna.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan said this and moved her curled up body. Then there was a big white egg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that&#8217;s it. Was Melissa-chan keeping this egg warm for a long time?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations, Melissa-chan, Jerome-kun!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, thank you. And, Anna, you don&#8217;t have to talk in that strange way, okay? Why don&#8217;t you speak normally? Also, you can call us as you like, both me and Jerry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it okay? Melissa-chan says so too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. That&#8217;s right. Then Melissa, Jerome, nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Melissa returned to her egg-warming position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, hey, can I give you both my blessing? Well, so many things happened, and I&#8217;m ashamed to admit it, but I&#8217;ve become an Ice Saint.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessing is one of the abilities of the Ice Saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is not as powerful as the blessing of that pervert but is said to be a good luck charm, so to speak, as it promotes healthy growth and protects a little against serious illnesses that could bring one to the verge of life or death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Anna doesn&#8217;t understand this area well, so I&#8217;ll investigate it one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Is that so? Good for you. But, well, if that&#8217;s the case, can I have it for my unborn child? We have the blessing of the wind god, so that&#8217;s enough for us. We will face retribution if we ask for too much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa responded to Anna&#8217;s offer in a lighthearted manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. I think so too. I&#8217;d like to give it to my child.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s the case, we&#8217;ll come back when the baby is born, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Anna backed down, albeit reluctantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also, I brought you plenty of beef to thank you. And I bet you&#8217;re going through a rough time right now, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say that and serve them the beef I&#8217;ve packed in a large quantity in my magic bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah! Thank you! Allen-san is the best!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa was overjoyed when I told her this and proceeded to eat the beef as if devouring it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Jerry, you don&#8217;t want some? If you don&#8217;t want it, I&#8217;ll eat it all, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, is that okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san brought this for both of us, you know? How could you not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-Itadakimasu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jerome-kun, who was told that, shook his tail happily and started eating meat with Melissa-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I went to thank the pervert while asking her to take care of the 『Staff of Divine Guidance』 afterwards, but she said &#8216;I see. Well then, I look forward to the birth of your child,&#8217; in a cat-like manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but Anna who heard it turned bright red and was very cute.</span></p>
