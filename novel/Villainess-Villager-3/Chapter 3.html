<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Villager A Takes the Villainess to the Doctor</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Is that Allen? What the hell is this!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, please, I need a doctor as soon as possible, a doctor who is very good at his profession. Then prepare a bed where Anna can safely rest.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly explain the matter without greeting him. I know in my head that this is rude, but I want to get Anna to the doctor as soon as possible.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A doctor? For Anna? No, wait! Where&#8217;s Anna?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Over here. Please! Quickly! I beg you!&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I plead with the Duke while pointing to Anna sleeping on the Buitor Rev.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna! &#8230;&#8230; Understood. Hey, hurry up and get the carriage ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to. I&#8217;ll carry her straight to the yard of the Duke&#8217;s mansion. So I need a bed and a doctor!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, okay, Understood. I won&#8217;t say another word. Hey, you heard the man. Get ready. You, too, Allen. My house is the biggest building in the centre of town. You&#8217;ll understand if you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay! Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took off in the Buitor Rev. and flew directly over the capital, then landed in the yard of the Duke&#8217;s mansion with the help of Melissa and Jerome.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hi~ee, dra-dragon!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uwa ~a~a~a~a~a~a~a!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The servants were surprised to see Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun, whereas the guards were trembling and readying their swords and spears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ga o~tsu</span><span style="font-weight: 400">♪</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Melissa opened her mouth and funnily threatened them, some of the servants fainted, and some of them became incontinent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Melissa, don&#8217;t tease them much&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t want to do anything, but when she reacted like that, I just couldn&#8217;t restrain myself.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stand up and hold Anna to my side. The arrow wound hurts like hell and feels like it&#8217;s burning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hugged Anna to my side and yelled loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We have rescued Lady Anastasia from the Empire! I&#8217;ve already informed the Duke, who won in the battle, about her! A physician will be here shortly, so prepare a place for her to rest quickly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s all the fuss &#8230;&#8230; my, my Lady! What is with that look of her!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the commotion, a dignified maid came out from inside the building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was rapt when she saw Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun, but the next moment she noticed Anna in my arms and rushed over to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she quickly frowns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s outfit may be part of it, but probably both Anna and I smell terrible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I need a place where she can rest quickly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I get it! I don&#8217;t know who you are, but I appreciate it. This way, please.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was led into the building with Anna in my arms and laid her down on a large soft bed in a very luxurious lady&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it my imagination, or did Anna&#8217;s expression seem to waver a little at that moment?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, I presume. I will change the dress of my lady. We will prepare a room, so can you wait there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied and was led by another young maid to the room across the hall. It was a large room with modest furnishings and a relaxed atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sir, please use this room. Also, your military uniform is very dirty. So I will prepare a change of clothes for you. Please wait a moment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the maid went out and soon came back with a change of clothes. Apparently, the clothes prepared were the military uniforms of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army, and they had brought several sizes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will help you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Oh no.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, this is the work of a maid. Also, you&#8217;re injured, aren&#8217;t you? I can take care of it if it&#8217;s something simple.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was told that, I was half-heartedly pushed to take care of the arrow wound and help me change my clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And thank you, Allen-sama, for rescuing my lady. If you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, the maid left my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I&#8217;m pretty sleepy from staying up all night yesterday. But my arrow wound is burning, and I feel like I&#8217;m being forcibly woken up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I&#8217;m still worried about Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer, so I slipped out of the room and headed for Anna&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, the maids came out in a row. It seemed that they had finished changing her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knock and then try to go inside, but the maid stops me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My lady is resting now. Please refrain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was indignant for a moment when I was stopped, but after thinking about it, it was only natural for a maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can&#8217;t help but worry. I knew it was selfish of me, but I insisted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, I&#8217;m worried about her. So, I&#8217;d like to see her face&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My lady is asleep. I will call you again when she wakes up, so please refrain from doing so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m worried about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was pondering what to do, I heard the Duke&#8217;s voice from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I also need Allen. Come with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid withdrew without a word, and the Duke came in with Elisabeth and an old man in a white coat who appeared to be a doctor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we enter the room where Anna is resting. She is sleeping peacefully with her eyelids closed, her body cleansed and her hair arranged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved that she was sleeping peacefully, but at the same time, I was worried that she might not wake up again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke came up to me and started talking to me, who was feeling like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Allen. Can you tell me what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. There are some deep military and political issues that I would like to discuss. Is it okay to talk here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glance at the doctor and check with the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. He is also a servant of my dukedom. He&#8217;s not the kind of fool who falls prey to selfishness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. The first thing you need to know is that the main culprits who kidnapped Anna&#8230;&#8230;stasia-sama are the Crown Prince of the Est Empire and a magician who seems to be close to him.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment he hears this, the Duke&#8217;s face suddenly turns grim, and the doctor is also upset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also, the Crown Prince and that man said that they would break Anastasia-sama&#8217;s heart and let the magic sword rule her. From what I&#8217;ve overheard, it seems that they locked her up alone in the dark, told her lies that we&#8217;re not alive, weakened her mind, and then gave her the demon sword when her mind was weak.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s this magic sword?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But this is the sword that Anastasia-sama was holding when I rescued her. Perhaps it affects the spirit of the person who holds it, so I brought it with me like this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed the magic sword, which I was carrying around my waist wrapped in a kind of scabbard made from the walls of the prison, on the floor and showed it to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, I hadn&#8217;t thought of appraising the sword in the Empire, and I couldn&#8217;t appraise it in this state when I couldn&#8217;t see it completely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The details of this magical sword remain a mystery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So that&#8217;s the magic sword&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can take it out now, but what do you want to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, let&#8217;s not do that. I&#8217;ll not be able to handle it if something happens.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at the duke&#8217;s decision and resumed my explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. Let me return to the story. I followed the two of them to the prison where Lady Anastasia was confined. And when the man who was not the Crown Prince used some kind of magic and started to torment Anastasia-sama even more, I couldn&#8217;t resist intervening, so I killed them and rescued her. Then, with the help of my friends, the Sky Dragon couple, I escaped the Imperial Capital and flew through the night to get here!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tell him that much at once, the Duke is holding his head in his hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say Imperial Capital? And you killed the Crown Prince? You came all the way here from the Imperial Capital in one night? Moreover, those Sky Dragons are husband and wife, and that they&#8217;re your friends, is that it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke huffed and sighed loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are not saying things just off the top of your head, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It was those two Sky Dragons that found Anastasia-sama. I&#8217;ve also brought back the heads of the Crown Prince and the other man in a magic bag.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Duke heard this, he looked up to the heavens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all I know about the situation. Oh, and I watched over her the whole time she was flying, but Anastasia-sama stayed asleep and, well, she didn&#8217;t wake up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, I understand. Hey &#8230; can you cure her?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duke looked at the old doctor with an expression of clinging to hope despite his tone, but he shook his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. As long as there is a magic sword involved, there is nothing a doctor can do about it. The only thing we can do is to put our trust in the mercy of God. Also, if there is anyone who can heal the mind of a person, it is probably the Great Sage. But that person is already&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. There must have been a great person in the past. But it can&#8217;t be helped&#8230;..he is deceased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Loringus-sensei&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised at Elisabeth-san&#8217;s muttering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Lorin&#8230;..gus? Then! Duke! I&#8217;ll take Anna now!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, things in front of my eyes wavered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The arrow wound hurt as if it had been burned by flames, and then my heart suddenly started palpitating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? What&#8230;..is this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Breathing&#8230;.not well&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221; &#8220;Allen-kun?&#8221; &#8220;You!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my distant consciousness, I thought I heard someone calling my name.</span></p>
