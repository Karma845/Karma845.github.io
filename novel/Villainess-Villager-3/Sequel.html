<h3>Sequel Side &#8211; Amy (End)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why! Why!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why should I have to go through this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spirit of light protected you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, isn&#8217;t it mine?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hair ornament too! And the blessing of the Spirit of Light too!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, what the hell! Holy ice?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are you using that kind of thing when you&#8217;re supposed to fall into the darkness!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not funny!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You use dark ice, right? Don&#8217;t be silly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, I&#8217;m forced to be a prostitute in the mine!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you thinking! Of course, it&#8217;s wrong!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am the Saint of Charity! Do you think you can get away with this for free?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyhow, what&#8217;s wrong with them?</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are they even friendly with the Sky Dragon when he&#8217;s supposed to be a boss character!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no such route!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken in front of some gorilla man I didn&#8217;t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see her the last time we captured her, but, is this the witch who has done so much evil to our Anna and Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wrong! It&#8217;s Saint of Charity!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to argue with him, but I couldn&#8217;t get any sound out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To take away people&#8217;s voices, isn&#8217;t the magic quite suitable for the villainess!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh well. I would have executed you right away. But since Anna wants me to make sure you&#8217;re properly remorseful, I&#8217;ll spare you the execution.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m not guilty, right? Because I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about it, but aren&#8217;t you the one who let the rogues take away Anna without hassle to the Empire?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wha! What! You&#8217;re bringing up old stuff like that! Besides, that&#8217;s what happens to the villainess if the scenario plays out the way it&#8217;s supposed to!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that face of yours is bad. So, I&#8217;m going to have you work as a prostitute in the mines. Well, I don&#8217;t know how long you will live, but I hope you will reflect on your sins there.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait! Hey!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t get the words out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They put me straight into a cage like they were carrying a pet and loaded me into a wagon like I was luggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are four guards other than the coachman, all looking at me with dirty eyes and sometimes with a sneer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gross!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s unpleasant to be looked at by ugly people like you guys!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after all, there was no voice &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the carriage started moving with me in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, what&#8217;s going to happen to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right, we&#8217;ll camp here today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell! What are you thinking, camping out? I am the Saint of Charity!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here. Today&#8217;s meal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I was presented with a soup of scraps of vegetables and a hard loaf of bread that I don&#8217;t know how many days ago it was baked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What! This is worse than the food I ate when I was living in poverty!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I try to complain, I can&#8217;t make a voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That bitch! Despite being a villainess!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is it? Not going to eat it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glared at him. This is not human food. Bring me something more decent to eat!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he starts saying something weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I heard you grew up in a poor, run-down part of Lurden, and you can&#8217;t even eat this? I guess the self-proclaimed &#8220;Saint of Charity&#8221; who lived in the lap of luxury can&#8217;t go back to her old life, can she?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? Old life? What do you mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was living at the bottom of the society, but it still wasn&#8217;t this bad, you know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Wrong? Well, that&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t know about you, but this is a real bottom-of-the-barrel meal. This is what you&#8217;ll be eating from now on, so eat up. If you don&#8217;t eat it, I&#8217;ll force-feed it to you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I-I get it. I just have to eat it!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I bring it to my mouth&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unpalatable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t taste good at all. And you can&#8217;t even chew the bread!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not bread!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Soak it in soup to soften it and eat it. What&#8217;s with that? What&#8217;s with the experience of living in poverty? You witch.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? ! I&#8217;m not a witch! I&#8217;m the Saint of Charity!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m the heroine of this world!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m sure Karl-sama, Oscar and Claude will come to my rescue!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure they will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Otherwise, it&#8217;s a lie!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve finished eating. Then, you&#8217;ll be dealing with 10 of my men today. They&#8217;re all piled up, so take care of them, will you? Saint-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, the man took the dishes with a sneer on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? What do you mean? 10 people? Company?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking that, and then these guys came in, looking kind of gruff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, this one&#8217;s a real winner, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gahaha. It&#8217;ll get messed up and you won&#8217;t be able to tell anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Dude, that ain&#8217;t right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re last. It&#8217;ll be too loose after you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? Aren&#8217;t you just small!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? You&#8217;re too big.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? What? What do you mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s start with me first? I&#8217;m not much use to an aristocrat&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No! Don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m the heroine!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I thought that the stars flew before my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I felt a burning pain in my left cheek and&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Did I get hit?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Get your ass in here! I&#8217;ll shove it in you while you&#8217;re still wet!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hi~tsu. No&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, stop! Stop!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noooooooooo!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I arrived at the mine I was being sent to in 20 days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was supposed to arrive in 10 days, but it looks like they took a detour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, those guys did whatever they wanted with me&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even have the energy to resist anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am in the worst situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh. By the way, you can&#8217;t even use healing magic if you can&#8217;t speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized it for the first time. Because I can&#8217;t chant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m the heroine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder why I have to go through this kind of thing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s definitely not right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It should have been the villainess who would have done this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahh, from today to the men here&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh, that&#8217;s enough. It&#8217;s the same anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of these days, someone will help me. Yes, I&#8217;m sure &#8230;&#8230; Karl-sama will&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how long it has been.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I&#8217;m not feeling well these days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My skin is also tattered. My hair is messed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And lately, I&#8217;ve been getting feverish and sick. I&#8217;ve also been getting eczema and bumps all over my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They called me weird for it and stopped calling me because of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hah. I know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m no good anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where did I make the wrong choice?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the beginning&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wrong&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, Karl-sama&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m&#8230;sorry&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Where&#8217;s this place?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Royal Castle&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; dance hall?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia, as of this moment, I am breaking off my engagement to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, I do not understand what you mean.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. You are still a woman of poor understanding. Amy, with her kind heart and healing powers, is the one who deserves to be my fiancée, not a rotten-brained woman like you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Karl-sama? Villainess?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, giving me a hug like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Eh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you really think that a woman who does not know the etiquette, what nobility is, or what a country is, is a good choice? Do you really think that she is capable of being the Queen of the nation?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess kept her expression and turned her cold gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was scared because I remembered that time when she looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Karl-sama kindly hugged me like that &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then then &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama defeats the villainess and&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Somehow it got dark in front of me &#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where is Karl-sama?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I see …</span></p>
