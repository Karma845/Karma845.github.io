<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Villager A Overruns the Centraren Army</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two weeks had passed since Anna had woken up. She had recovered to the point where she could walk on her own and was now able to take a walk in the garden.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, her smile has increased considerably, which makes me happy as her fiancé.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I have already removed the magic sealing collar. As that pervert said, the item was not much of a hassle, and I was able to destroy it quickly after processing it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, at last, the Centraren Kingdom has made up its mind and set out to subjugate the rebellion of the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the intel of the spies, the Crown Prince was motivated for some reason, is it because he doesn&#8217;t want to become unworthy?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, troops were finally dispatched from all over the country in the form of the King&#8217;s decree. The soldiers that were supposed to be stationed in Bruseni were included in the troops, which made me laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Lol (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≧∇≦</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)ﾉ)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure what happened for them to make such a decision, but that&#8217;s what they did anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a side note, the Centraren Kingdom has yet to make peace with the Est Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, they used the heads of the two men we left behind and publicized the fact that we had taken the Crown Prince&#8217;s head everywhere, which sparked enthusiasm in the Est Empire to have a battle of attrition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a foolish thing to do, even though I was very careful not to let that happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s none of our business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the Duke of Ramslett has finally declared his independence from the royal family of Centraren and, together with the southern nobles, called themselves the Kingdom of Ramslett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in addition to the southern nobles, several other lords have offered their allegiance to the Kingdom of Ramslett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were nobles who had territories in steep mountainous terrain and lands full of monsters, also those who could not feed their people with their own agricultural production alone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, they chose a realistic approach of allegiance rather than their downfall due to rebellion caused by starving the people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, if they remained in Centraren, they would be ordered to deploy their army to defeat the Ramslett. Then, it&#8217;s obvious that they&#8217;ll be fighting me who destroyed the Est Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one wants to lose their soldiers, who are also farmers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, the Kingdom of Ramslett expanded its territory not only to the south, but also to the east and part of the west, and came to occupy 30-40% of the former Centraren Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, in such a situation, the Centraren Kingdom&#8217;s army invaded Ramslett.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Supreme General is the Crown Prince Karlheinz. In addition, for some reason or another, Amy, Markus, Leonardo, Oscar, and the other members of Amy&#8217;s reverse harem are all here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter to me anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, Anna. I&#8217;m going. You&#8217;re not completely healthy yet, so go to your room and get some rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Take care of yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Anna and I embrace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we parted, Anna stretched out and kissed me on the cheek.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Woah, the tension rose quite a bit!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then let&#8217;s give victory to the princess.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a bit of coolness, I started up the wind magic engine of my Buitor Rev. and took off. I then gave a small wave to the blushing Anna and headed for the battlefield.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Less than an hour later, I arrived at the spot where the two armies were locked in a standoff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that the number on our side is 5,000, while the number for Centraren is about 30,000.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we were at an overwhelming disadvantage in terms of numbers, there was no sense of sadness on our side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because everyone knows that I can turn the tide of the war any way I want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from what I could see from the air, it seems that they are still shooting arrows and magic at each other.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of battle, you may imagine a spectacular cavalry charge, but the basic idea of combat is to attack with long-range weapons to reduce the numbers and then engage in close combat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there are times when the cavalry will charge through them or flank them with separate units, but this is usually the case in stare-off battles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, no one wants to charge where they are unilaterally attacked by arrows and magic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I will bomb the enemy without worrying about who is where.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a simple job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There may have been someone familiar mixed in on the other side, but if they were enemies on the battlefield, it was unavoidable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m prepared to do that, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the bombed Centraren army quickly panicked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mercilessly dropped additional bombs on the enemies, in that state, like rain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just work now. The same scene is unfolding as when I devastated the soldiers of the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about an hour of bombing, I saw that the Centraren army was completely destroyed, and I returned to the capital.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I landed in the backyard of the Duke&#8217;s residence, no royal palace, Anna came running up to me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Are you hurt?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m home. As you can see, everything&#8217;s fine. I was just flying over the sky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna was relieved to hear those words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hugged Anna and gently kissed her, and then walked into the royal palace. I feel the warmth of the precious woman in my arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result of my one-sided bombing overrun, the battle between our Ramslett Kingdom Army and the Centraren Kingdom Army was decided. As a result, the battle that happened at the northern border of the Ramslett Kingdom against an overwhelmingly superior number ended in the Ramslett Kingdom Army&#8217;s victory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this battle, the Centraren Kingdom lost 25,000 of its 30,000 troops, including wounded soldiers and deserters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the history of the war was marked by the humiliating defeat of the Crown Prince Karlheinz, the Supreme General, and the heirs of the noble families who were captured as prisoners of war or killed in battle. </span></p>
