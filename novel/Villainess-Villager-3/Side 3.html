<h2>Side &#8211; Amy (2)</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wh-What&#8217;s going on? What the hell is this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This side has 30,000 troops and they have 10,000 troops, right? Oh, now that I&#8217;m here and see, it&#8217;s 5,000 troops?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t care about that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are we in such a bad situation in such a winning battle?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, God. I shouldn&#8217;t have followed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came here because I heard it was going to be a piece of cake!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I thought it was an easy win because there were so many of us over here and so few over there by all appearances!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I noticed, there were explosions only on our side&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is it? What&#8217;s going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah! That weird flying thing!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama. Isn&#8217;t that thing dropping the bombs on us?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They all looked up when I said that. But they looked hopeless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-How on earth is that thing so high up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even with my bow, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Magic also can&#8217;t reach it? And what is a bomb? You mean that explosion?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">that&#8217;s cowardly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">! Come down!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, Leo! What are you talking about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to come down because it&#8217;s acting cowardly. You brainless idiot!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why you lose to that nerd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Nerd?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that guy?! Are you using a knowledge cheat?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes! That&#8217;s it. He&#8217;s a reincarnated person too. (T/N:- it&#8217;s not like she can do anything now knowing that.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How far do you want to keep getting in my way!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, this is bad. Let&#8217;s get out of here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time Karl-sama told me and I realized it, it was too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enemy soldiers have surrounded us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they tied us up and took us away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s going to happen to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I finally became the Saint of Charity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I think about it, the words of the Saints of Charity are powerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried it out on the guard who was bringing us our food, and after a few sweet nothings, he dropped off his guard in no time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, they put me in a kind of small room, but soon they moved me to a decent room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, when we all asked him to let us talk to that nerd, he readily agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It pisses me off, but it seems like I should make that guy fall for me too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of things, but at first, he just looked at me and flinched, so I figured there&#8217;s plenty of room for a little coaxing, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so everyone was gathered in one room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I&#8217;m glad everyone is okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I&#8217;m a prisoner of war now, though I don&#8217;t want to be tied up, I don&#8217;t have a choice, do I?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be a problem if I asked for more here and was told that it was no good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I waited for a while and that nerd came into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Karl-sama immediately complained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey. Commoner. Release us now. It&#8217;s treason to rise up against the royal family!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Do you think you can do this to me, the Saint of Charity?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops, not good. I was about to start talking like I usually do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy should also fall for me, right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey? More importantly, unravel the rope?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled at him like I did when we first met and told him about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, now you are done for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to confirm something to Your Highness. The one to secretly sell Anastasia-sama to the Empire and forged the Jade seal was Your Highness, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? What is this guy? Did you ignore me despite being a nerd? It&#8217;s irritating!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy-sama, did you know that story? No, was it Amy-sama who instigated it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He talks back to me, but it&#8217;s about that woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m kind of pissed, so I&#8217;m going to bully you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph, isn&#8217;t it obvious? That woman is there to be messed up and become a weapon of the empire. I&#8217;d rather you praise me for doing the right thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">See! Everyone is agreeing with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m right!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I still kept messing around with us, so I told him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But that woman has fallen into the hands of the Empire. She&#8217;s probably enchanted by the Demon Sword by now, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, he was silent. Serves you right!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew it. That woman must have had enough darkness in her heart to be attracted to a magic sword.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama agreed with me after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu? How is it! There is no one on your side!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Are you okay? Why did you believe in the Demon Sword so easily?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, the Saint, is saying it! There can be no mistake!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He argues with me, but Karl-sama affirms me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was comfortably listening to Karl-sama&#8217;s words, the door suddenly opened and that woman entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? What do you mean by this!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Anastasia?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It has been a long time, Your Highness. And everyone else, too. You seem to be as full of energy as ever.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the woman sarcastically greets us when we&#8217;re surprised, she clings to that nerd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell! It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s a prostitute!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, she calls herself a princess! And the commoner is her fiancé, also they are in love with each other even though it&#8217;s a political marriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s ridiculous. Anyone can do these self-proclaimed acts!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought so, the nerd snatched the 『Staff of Divine Guidance』 from my waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Give it back! That&#8217;s mine!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No way, this staff is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s a staff for me, a Saint! You, who is not the chosen one, are not allowed to have it! Give it back!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A Saint, huh? You?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! I was recognized by this 『Staff of Divine Guidance』! That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a Saint of Charity!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I say so, this nerd is looking at me with suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, what happened to the blessing? Without that, you wouldn&#8217;t qualify as a Saint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, that&#8217;s that. I became a Saint.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, geez. I&#8217;m pissed. What is wrong with you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t it your fault for stealing the event!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just when I thought he was staring at my staff, he pulls out some kind of rock. What on earth is he doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking that, the villainess took the liberty of grabbing my staff and touching it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, hey! What are you doing touching my staff as if it&#8217;s natural?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t you know that it&#8217;s not something that the villainess is allowed to touch?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if weird germs get attached to it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Karl-sama and that nerd shouted at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, calling me a witch is beyond rude!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Guaaaaaa&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Leo tore off the rope and attacked that woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing! As expected!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At once, that nerd covered up for that woman but was blown away. And isn&#8217;t he covered in blood?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha. I can hear her sorrowful screams which calms my irritation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serves them right!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, that nerd who is hiding that woman is &#8230; hmm. Well, not bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s going to die soon anyway, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s get out of here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No! My staff! Moreover, we have to put an end to that guy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Ah no, no, it&#8217;s better to let Amy escape.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t believe that Karl-sama, who always listens to me, would say that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll stay behind to finish them and bring the staff back. Please, Your Highnesses, take care of Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if Leo says so, I guess it&#8217;s safe to go?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Okay, but you&#8217;re definitely coming back alive, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that and prayed a little, Leo nodded deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu. Since I, the Saint of Charity, prayed like this, Leo should be able to kill them and come back safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right! I am the heroine and the Saint of Charity, so my word should be absolute!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it&#8217;s okay!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">See ya. Goodbye villainess and nerd-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope you go to hell right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I won!</span></p>
