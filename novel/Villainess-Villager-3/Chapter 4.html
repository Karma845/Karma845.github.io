<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Villager A Talks to the Villainess&#8217;s Father</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself lying on a bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you awake?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes, the maid who guided me, looked at me with a worried expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is Allen-sama&#8217;s room that I showed earlier. Allen-sama had collapsed and had been asleep for about five hours.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank God, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve been asleep for three days or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;According to the doctor, there is a high possibility that the arrow that Allen-sama was hit with was coated with a special magic poison made with the proprietary technology of the Est Empire. The poison is said to take away the life of the victim after a certain amount of time has passed, and there is no antidote for it except in the Empire. The only way to get rid of it is in the empire. So, originally, Allen-sama should not be able to survive&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What, poisoned arrow!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly checked my left hand. As expected, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was wearing had shattered into pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So, now I have no more insurance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about Anna&#8230;.stasia-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She&#8217;s still asleep, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s anything wrong with her life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly raise myself up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Would you like me to help?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to stand up, my stomach rumbled loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops. By the way, I haven&#8217;t eaten anything since last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure I have a subtle expression on my face from embarrassment and subtle awkwardness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring you some food. Also, I will report to the Master, so please wait a while.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the maid left my room. Then she brought me a sandwich and as I was picking it up, I was immediately summoned by the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only the duke but also Elisabeth-san and Friedrich-san are present at the place where I was summoned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke, after confirming that I was seated, waved the others to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you&#8217;re back on your feet, good.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the Duke looked relieved and suddenly thanked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, it&#8217;s my fault that my daughter turned out the way she is now. Also, thank you for risking your life to save her. I know I&#8217;m a foolish father who couldn&#8217;t have done anything for her, but I still want to express my gratitude. Thank you very much. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun, thank you so much for getting my daughter back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, it&#8217;s not good for the Duke to be seen behaving this way towards the commoners, so he made the others leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. It&#8217;s just something I really wanted to do.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, the Dukes gave me a complicated look like they were troubled or relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Friedrich-san also thanked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, Anna is my dear sister. Let me express my gratitude too. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No……&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well. So, you were responsible for the mysterious explosions that occurred only in the Xaus Kingdom&#8217;s army today, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Yes. That&#8217;s right. Well, it&#8217;s like my magic. They were a hindrance to Anna&#8217;s check-up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After all is that so&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all Friedrich-san said and remained silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, you were supposed to have gone to the Bruseni front alone to fight the Est invasion, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. The entire region of Bruseni is now under the control of the Centraren Kingdom. There may be some resistance, but there shouldn&#8217;t be any significant bases left.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? What happened to Cardassia?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I felled them, and most of the inhabitants were banished to the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..I see, fortified city Cardassia, that we haven&#8217;t been able to recapture for 50 years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then silence reigned over us for a little while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s probably not fair to say in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I decided it was now or never and opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, I have a request.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.What is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke looked quite cautious, wondering what he would be asked to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it&#8217;s quite rare for a duke to have such an attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve fulfilled my promise. So, please give me your daughter, Anna.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the expressions on the faces of the three people froze. The expression &#8216;like a pigeon eating a peashooter&#8217; could be used to describe the expressions of these three people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been such an unexpected request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? A-Allen-kun? Is that okay? If it&#8217;s about my daughter, you&#8217;ve been good to her, and that&#8217;s enough already, you know? Allen, you should look for your own happiness&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I love Anna, I can&#8217;t think of a woman other than her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But the doctor also said it was too late.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have faith that Anna will come back. No, I&#8217;ll make sure she comes back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..I see. That much&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her that I was determined to do so, Elisabeth-san said so and kept her mouth shut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, well, if you say so much, isn&#8217;t it okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if Friedrich-san can&#8217;t find the words or if he has some ideas, but he seems to agree with me anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a little light for the next Duke though&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, the way things are going, Elisabeth-san probably won&#8217;t object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, what do you mean you&#8217;ve fulfilled your promise?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Duke is not going to be swayed. But I am confident that I can make him shake his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please have a look at this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed him the order for deployment that I had received from the King. The Duke frowned when he saw the contents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No way I didn&#8217;t expect you to have been given an order like this&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. Lead our country to victory by defeating the Est soldiers, capturing Cardassia, and reclaiming the Bruseni region. If done so, I will be given anything I desire. That&#8217;s the order I&#8217;ve been given.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, it was properly worded that the reward would be as I wish, and it was an order in the King&#8217;s own handwriting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the Jade Seal is also firmly stamped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was the one who destroyed most of the Bruseni&#8217;s enemy forces. With the help of the method you saw, and sometimes used a fire attack by dropping a lot of oil from the sky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then I sneaked into the imperial capital and killed the Crown Prince and his aide in the palace, and brought back their heads. May I serve you here now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, put it out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Elisabeth and she nodded, so I didn&#8217;t hesitate to take out the two raw heads from my magic bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely Igor, the Crown Prince of the Est Empire. And&#8230;&#8230;isn&#8217;t this guy Günther, Commander of the Imperial Magic Division?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have defeated my enemies in Bruseni under the name of Allen, a B-rank adventurer receiving the protection of the Duke of Ramslett.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told him that I&#8217;m not going to let him down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke crossed his arms, wrinkled his brow and pretended to think long and hard before he opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s admit. On the honour of my Ramslett Dukedom, I will recognize the marriage of Allen and Anastasia, and the Duke, who protects Allen, will undertake the negotiations with the Royal Family in his name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I got up from my chair, I knelt down and bowed like a retainer. Then I handed over the raw heads of the hateful men and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to the room I was given and sat down on the bed and sighed heavily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that now was the only time to get him to admit it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Duke said he would wait for three years, I assumed that he would be willing to accept it, if necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, he is also cold-hearted enough to use Anna to stabilize his territory without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I didn&#8217;t think that my promise to wait three years would be kept. But on the other hand, I also thought that he would wait for me unless something went wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why the Duke accepted my request at that time was because he thought I was powerful enough to present Anna with an epic-grade ring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Substitute Ring</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is something that any nobleman who fears assassination would want to have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you sell it to a source like that, you could probably make at least tens of billions of money, maybe even trillions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an adventurer, I found it from the dungeon on my own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I&#8217;m sure the Duke&#8217;s scales have tipped in my favour over some rich upstart aristocrat or a well-to-do person who just wants the name of the Duke of Ramslett, or some old man with a colour blur problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after I took Anna and showed her how to traverse the Dungeon of the Wind Mountain, he would have known that what I was saying was not a lie, and my presence would have become even heavier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In such a situation, Anna had gone through such conditions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true, of course, that the Duke is saddened by this, as a father who loves his daughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s easy to see that the Duke of Ramslett has family ties and affections, unlike the cold aristocratic families that we, the general public, would imagine by hearing just their names.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the option of not using Anna as a pawn in a political marriage, no matter how much they bonded and loved each other, would not have existed in the Duke&#8217;s mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after this incident, Anna is completely useless as a pawn in a political marriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No man would go out of his way to marry a woman who was bedridden and unconscious, no matter how much he wanted to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Anna&#8217;s current value as a pawn in a political marriage is zero, or even negative.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, the man who had single-handedly destroyed the troops of the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus, and assassinated the Crown Prince of the Empire, came to offer a deal in a way that would honour the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He told me that if he gave me his daughter, who was bedridden and the doctors had given up on, he would give me all the credit for her and take me under his wing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a bit of his weakness, but this is how I finally got Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell backwards and lay down on the soft bed and sighed heavily again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, more than this, I wanted you to smile &#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
