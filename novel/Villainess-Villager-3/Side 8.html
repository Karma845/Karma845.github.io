<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (6)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those imperial soldiers out there, are so stubborn, aren&#8217;t they? I&#8217;ve been cheering the soldiers over here, so they are supposed to be death-defying soldiers and quite strong, even then why?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t it strange, even though Karl-sama and Markus are also doing their best?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, maybe that nerd has a hand in it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, then that nerd is a cold-blooded person.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much do you hate me for cooperating with the country that kidnapped your beloved villainess!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s too bad.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, the Saint of Charity and heroine of this world, am determined to have a happy ending.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, you know, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the world of my favourite otome game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be strange if I don&#8217;t have a happy ending even though I haven&#8217;t made a mistake in my choices!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought so, it seemed like something was going wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama. What happened?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Amy. Apparently, the underground sewers have been targeted by the Imperial Guard. It seems that someone has been leading the Imperial Guard through there and they&#8217;re invading the city.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you saying!? I, the Saint of Charity, can&#8217;t believe that there is a traitor in this town where I am!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We will have to take them down, one by one. It&#8217;s okay, Amy. We will definitely protect you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama says so, but after all, it seems that he is impatient.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is this all about?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could this be the event where the royal city is destroyed once, as in the game?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, that&#8217;s not good.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I&#8217;ve come this far, I can&#8217;t let them get to us like this!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hang in there, me! Think about it, me!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about it for a moment, my head hurt, but I came up with a good idea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama. I have an idea!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s reliable. Is it a Saint&#8217;s prophecy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama looks at me kindly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, the enemy is in the sewers, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then we can pour poison gas down the sewers! Then, all the evil enemy soldiers will be killed!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Karl-sama&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, as expected of myself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But if we do that, there will be damage to the surroundings and downstream residents. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Is it useless?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if the royal capital is destroyed by Imperial soldiers here, then everyone will be killed, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if there are imperial soldiers in the underground sewers we used to escape in the game, there&#8217;s no way we can escape, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even know if we can go to the Kingdom of Westerdale since Claude is not here in the first place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that case, we have no choice but to do it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. Besides, it&#8217;s the commoners who will die as collateral damage from the poison anyway, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they were the ones who were originally supposed to be killed by the imperial soldiers, weren&#8217;t they?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? What the heck. Then it doesn&#8217;t matter!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama, you should do it! I, the Saint of Charity, will pray for the victims! So, if you don&#8217;t, all the people of the royal capital will be killed!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pleaded with tears in my eyes, and Karl-sama nodded his head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that&#8217;s fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, now we&#8217;ve won.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This should end the event in which the royal capital is attacked, and we can go get the 『Scroll of Concealment』 later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha. It worked perfectly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard, a little bit of the residents around the sewer inlets and outlets have died, but nothing serious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, we were able to defeat the imperial soldiers without incident, and they are going to hold a memorial service for the victims soon, so all I have to do is say a prayer for them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, all we have to do is collect the 『Scroll of Concealment』.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? But who should use it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, we came to the entrance of the sewer system in the school.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they opened the door and I went into that little room I saw in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then on the desk here&#8230;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not there!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why!?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah! That guy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you need help with anything, please tell us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Karl-sama and Markus told me that with concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you know. Now I understand everything!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That nerd! You stole my 『Scroll of Concealment』!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- yep cause you&#8217;re an idiot for still following the story.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why he was able to do that in the duel and take back the villainess that was sold to the empire!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then! That means!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama! Markus! I have a request! Listen to me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
