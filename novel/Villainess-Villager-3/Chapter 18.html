<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Villager A Ascertain the Establishment of the Country</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, Amy and the others who escaped eventually got away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy apparently demonstrated her abilities as a witch to the fullest and even made some soldiers and residents listen to what she had to say by showering them with strong words. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the Ramslett army did not sit back and watch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They immediately sent out a search party and succeeded in capturing Oscar, but lost sight of Amy, the Crown Prince, and Markus when they entered the forest and missed them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if those guys will make it through the forest in one piece, but if I could, I would like to see them continue to be preyed upon by demons and beasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I know it&#8217;s a terrible thing to say, but Amy is just too dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, through the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild, we put a bounty of 300 million on Amy with the condition of Dead or Alive, that is, it&#8217;s fine even if she is killed, and that she be wanted as a witch who manipulates others with her words. She doesn&#8217;t have to be caught alive, but it also means that the adventurer will definitely take her head and kill her in effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in this world of colourful hairs, I don&#8217;t recall seeing anyone with pink hair other than her, so maybe she&#8217;ll get caught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, it turned out that those who have been brainwashed with 【Kotodama】 can be restored by Anna&#8217;s 【Holy Ice Magic】.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its name is Holy Ice Awakening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When this magic is used on someone who has been driven crazy by Amy&#8217;s words, their head is literally put on ice. The ice breaks immediately, but that is all it takes to release the person from being under the influence of Kotodama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in short, it&#8217;s magic that seems to reproduce the effect that freezes your head by the dialogue &#8220;cool your head&#8221; that you sometimes see in manga and anime.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, Anna says that this can be done over a wide area using a blizzard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I say, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one who thought I was going to sleep forever before I woke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, after all that happened, our Kingdom of Ramslett has decided to hold a National Foundation Day ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In preparation for this, I took the Buitor Rev. to the appropriate city in the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane and requested the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild to deliver King Ramslett&#8217;s letter addressed to the diplomatic offices of each country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason is that these two countries cannot be reached from our Ramslett Kingdom without passing through the Centraren Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, since the Kingdom of Xaus and the Kingdom of Westerdale are on the border, we delivered a letter to the border town of Xaus and to the port town of Westerdale where regular ships operate, from where an envoy was dispatched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content, of course, is a notice of the founding of the country and a request for approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, the Kingdom of Xaus, which had just recently been completely crushed, recognized the Kingdom of Ramslett on the condition that a peace treaty is signed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, no response has yet been received from the other countries, but we expect that the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane will probably approve, while Westerdale will dilly-dally and postpone the response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason we expect the Est Empire and the United Kingdom of Norsane to approve is simple: the enemy of my enemy is my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two countries see the Centraren Kingdom as an enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if the important southern part of the enemy country becomes independent, the power of the enemy will be reduced without doing anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For them, there would be no such delicious story other than this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, as for me, I can&#8217;t forgive the Est Empire for messing with Anna, but the current Kingdom of Ramslett can&#8217;t afford to expand its front to that extent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I have killed the two masterminds, so let&#8217;s call it good once and for all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next time they try to mess with me again, though, I&#8217;ll turn the Imperial City into a pile of rubble!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the reason I expect the Kingdom of Westerdale to postpone their reply is because they are currently friends of the Centraren Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, if the Kingdom of Centraren were to fall, we believe that the Kingdom of Westerdale would be relentless in its drive to carve up the western territories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, It would not be in their best interest to cut off the path to diplomatic relations with Ramslett. But that does not mean that they can&#8217;t pick a fight with the Kingdom of Centraren right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, then logically their response should be the postponement of their reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, the relationship between nations is not beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day of the National Foundation Day ceremony arrived. The square in front of the palace in Wishen, our royal capital, was crowded with people. Although we were holding a National Foundation Day ceremony, we were still in the middle of a war of independence with the Centraren Kingdom, so we did not plan a large-scale parade. The only thing to be done is for Gerhard-san to read out the Declaration of Nation&#8217;s Foundation and the introduction of the new King and his royal family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, since this town was originally the capital of the Duke of Ramslett, the rulers have not changed, but in short, it is a kind of clean distinction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the other thing is to announce the engagement of me and Anna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, I am dressed in the ceremonial, glittering military uniform of the Ramslett Royal Army, and Anna is dressed like a princess in her gleaming attire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, no, Anna was originally a Duke&#8217;s daughter and is now the first princess of the Kingdom of Ramslett, so she being a princess is right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, wearing a uniform is more familiar to me, so I have no other intention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I think Anna looks great in her dress. She&#8217;s really beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also on Anna&#8217;s left ring finger, she still wears the 『Substitute ring』 I gave her. Anna said she wanted this one, so it became her engagement ring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, my ring is an ordinary ring, but I had it specially made to look exactly like the 『Substitute ring』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the ceremony went smoothly and Gerhard-san, who became the King, read the Declaration of Nation&#8217;s Foundation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content pointed out the tyranny of the royal family of the Kingdom of Centraren and denied its legitimacy. In response, the Duke of Ramslett stood up as the protectors of their people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a good speech, conventional but typical of the Ramslett family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And one more good news from me to you all. It&#8217;s about my daughter, the first princess Anastasia.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Gerhard-san has finally reached the stage of introducing our engagement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am pleased to announce the engagement of my daughter Anastasia to Allen, the hero who defended our land of Ramslett from the invaders.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This elicited a shout of joy from the audience, but at the same time, a disappointed &#8220;eh&#8221; could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Gerhard-san continues his speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Blessed by the God of Wind, Allen is a hero among heroes who has demonstrated his exceptional talents in numerous battles, single-handedly destroying 80% of the enemy army. It is no exaggeration to say that our kingdom has thus received the blessings of God.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment they heard this, the audience got excited at once. After all, the hero who led the war to victory seems to be popular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen will marry Anastasia and take the name Allen von Ramslett. I want everyone to celebrate this joyous event.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Gerhard-san finally said that and finished his speech, the assembled audience erupted in jubilation. Anna and I waved to the audience from the podium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Is this the scenery that people on this side see? Will I ever get used to it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but mutter to myself when I saw Anna smiling and waving next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right. I didn&#8217;t expect such a blessing. It&#8217;s all thanks to Allen&#8217;s hard work. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you. But I&#8217;m kind of embarrassed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. I have to get used to it. I&#8217;ve decided to stand next to Anna. I&#8217;m not going to shy away from something like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna smiled gently at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after the rather simple National Foundation Day ceremony, it was time for a ball at the palace. Here came the former Centraren nobles who had been vassals to the Ramslett Kingdom and the second princess from the Kingdom of Xaus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This second princess is talking to Friedrich-san a lot, but Friedrich-san seems to be treating it appropriately. That is probably the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, since I can&#8217;t dance very well, and Anna hasn&#8217;t recovered yet, it&#8217;s difficult to attend the party for a long time, so we&#8217;ll just say hello.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we who attended the party, with both of us arm in arm, are dealing with the invited guests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m handling it well, but Anna&#8217;s response is magnificent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna is smiling and chatting with me, but she is turning down all dance invitations with me as an excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama, Allen-kun!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, two familiar people arrived. They are Margaret and Isabella.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had both returned to the territory when the school was closed, and this time they had forced their parents to attend this ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations on your engagement!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I was able to laugh naturally and thank them for their blessings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, they were both friends of Anna&#8217;s, but they treated me without any barriers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess they are also the reason why I have happy memories of the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Still, Allen-kun, you really went through with it. You crossed many dangerous paths just to win Anna&#8217;s heart. And now that the Duke, or should I say His Majesty, has recognized you, you&#8217;ve created your own branch of the Ramslett family, and have been adopted as a son-in-law, what more could you ask for?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But even after all he did. Allen-san is amazing. And I&#8217;m amazed that you can fly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even so, Anna-sama, you are really loved, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Please tell me the secret to being loved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha? Wait, hey? You guys?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s face turned red and she flinched when she was told that. Cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s the gap.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand, Anna-sama, we will learn from you too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Margaret? Isabella? Hey, Allen, too. Say something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna who asks me for help is also cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna is cute. I love you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! S-Stupid, in a place like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, I love you. I love you the most in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, silly&#8230;&#8230; me too&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two who heard this shouted with glee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a while, we were allowed to leave and the long day from the National Foundation Day ceremony was over.</span></p>
