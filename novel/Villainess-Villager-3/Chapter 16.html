<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Villager A Protects the villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A Saint, huh? You?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! I was recognized by this </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Staff of Divine Guidance</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400">! That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a Saint of Charity!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no matter how you look at it, you are the exact opposite of a Saint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, what happened to the blessing? Without that, you wouldn&#8217;t qualify as a Saint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, that&#8217;s that. I became a Saint.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no. What kind of logic is that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I appraise the staff I took up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><b>Name:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Staff of Divine Guidance</span></p>
<p><b>Description:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Those who take this staff with a truly strong desire in their hands, and whose strength of desire is recognized, will receive one skill or blessing that will fulfil their deepest, truest wish. May be used only once per person.</span></p>
<p><b>Grade:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Legendary</span></p>
<p><b>Price: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">???</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will be given the skill or blessing to make your true wishes come true?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a huff, I put the staff on the table beside me, took out a magic stone I had with me, and appraise Amy&#8217;s status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><b>Name:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Amy von Bryes</span></p>
<p><b>Age:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> 17</span></p>

<p><b>Magical power:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> C</span></p>
<p><b>Achievement:</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">: Given to those who wish to heal people&#8217;s wounds, illnesses, and hearts. It greatly increases a person&#8217;s aptitude for healing magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Witch of Envy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">: It is given to a woman who wishes to have all the opposite sex she desires and believes with all her heart that she can have it. It greatly increases her own attractiveness as a woman and significantly increases her aptitude for </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kotodama</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kotodama</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">: It is possible to put magic power on the words one utters aloud and imprint their contents on the target person. It is effective only when the target person perceives the words as positive in terms of favour, trust, lust, or some other emotion, and the more positive the perception, the greater the effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Wait a minute! Witch!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I yelled out in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ridiculous monster has been born!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this is left unchecked, we will be in serious trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Guards!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leo!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I shouted, the Crown Prince shouted Leonardo&#8217;s name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Leonard screams from the bottom of his belly and makes an unpleasant noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leonardo then forced his way out of the bind, grabbed a nearby chair, and attacked Anna, who was watching the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Staff of Divine Guidance</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Look out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately took a stand to protect Anna, who was unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to protect Anna, but Leonardo&#8217;s blow hit me squarely and I was blown away with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to prevent the impact on Anna, but I felt tremendous pain in my abdomen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up in pain and tried to fight back against Leonardo, but he struck me with a merciless blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I took the blow squarely in the face, stars flew in front of my eyes and I almost lost consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m on my knees and Anna is next to me, looking at me and calling out to me, looking like she&#8217;s about to start crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on! Let&#8217;s get out of here!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown princes shouted as he stood up, still bound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No! My staff! Moreover, we have to put an end to that guy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Ah no, no, it&#8217;s better to let Amy escape.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He almost nodded for a moment at the sound of Amy&#8217;s voice, but in the end, the Crown Prince chose to flee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll stay behind to finish them and bring the staff back. Please, Your Highnesses, take care of Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Okay, but you&#8217;re definitely coming back alive, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy and the others saw Leonardo nodding broadly, and they ran off without a hitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn. What the hell is going on? What are the guards who are supposed to be waiting outside doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I manage to stand up, with Anna supporting my back, and glare at Leonardo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you look closely, Leonardo&#8217;s left wrist is crushed and bleeding profusely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Apparently, he pulled himself out of the bind by force at the expense of his own left hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it is probably the effect of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">buff by the Crown Prince that made it possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in that condition, he should not be able to hold the sword anymore if he is not treated soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Amy is supposed to be able to use healing magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a cruel thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I don&#8217;t think I will be able to fight for much longer either, as I still have some damage from earlier and a piece of a broken chair from the first blow is lodged in my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Die! Vile commoner!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time Leonardo, holding a candlestick in his hand, attacked again, aiming not at me but at Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me! Which one of us is the coward!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hastily draw my sword and get between him and Anna to catch the candlestick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much he has the blessing of a</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, if he can only use one hand, I can manage. I thought so, but with the buff from</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, this guy was a monster, to be honest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My sword is lightly flicked away, and he strikes me in the side with the candlestick in his right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, who couldn&#8217;t catch the blow, was blown away and slammed hard into the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shock made me unable to breathe for a moment, but I desperately tried to stand up somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the wound was opened because the fragment of the chair was pierced into my side, and blood was dripping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe &#8230; This alone could be a fatal injury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I came to that realization, I collapsed to the ground, my strength draining from my knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not good! Anna! I have to &#8230; protect her! Stand up! Move!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! &#8230;&#8230; Leonardo! How dare you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At the commoner&#8217;s side&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leonardo calmly eluded Anna&#8217;s angry gaze and tried to insult me ​​again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Anna had finished her chanting before he could realise and invoked her magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ice sword dance!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, countless shimmering ice swords appear, and then, in the blink of an eye, they strike Leonardo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Gahh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leonardo, unable to even move, was hit by Anna&#8217;s magic and quietly collapsed without uttering a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Allen! hold on!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s worried face is in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, don&#8217;t look like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but &#8230; it&#8217;s my fault? &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, Anna, sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, hold on!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna gently held my hand as I apologized for worrying her. I was covered in blood now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, blood &#8230;&#8230; on your hands.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that. Don&#8217;t die! Hey! In a place like this! Hey! Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know. I don&#8217;t like it either. But I&#8217;d rather this than Anna dying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My vision gradually became blurred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I thought this was a happy ending already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I &#8230; I wasn&#8217;t careful again &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s voice becomes more and more distant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there is Anna&#8217;s crying face in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the last thing I can see was Anna&#8217;s face, then that&#8217;s also possible?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, but as expected I want you to laugh &#8230; is that not it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry …</span></p>
