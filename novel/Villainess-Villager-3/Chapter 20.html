<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; Villager A Heads North</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winter has finally arrived in the Kingdom of Ramslett. If we had continued to attend school, we would have graduated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, the Ramslett Kingdom is at peace itself, but there has been a great deal of activity in Centraren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Est empire marched westward to Lurden, the royal capital of the Centraren Kingdom, as in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As in the game, the towns along the way were quickly overrun and the army closed in on Lurden, but unlike in the game, Lurden held on without falling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to reports, Lurden&#8217;s soldiers have turned into dead soldiers and are making a desperate resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Like zombies but alive.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when they die, they would shout &#8216;long live the saint&#8217; and die. So I guess what I had feared had happened after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the men are being holed up in order, as expected, and the male spies who might have met that woman were all taken down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, not everything seems to be going well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In some cases, the men who have been entrapped in this way can be used as a foothold to entrap their families and lovers, but there will also be those who will be antagonistic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it&#8217;s as if a new cult has emerged in the royal capital, with Amy as the Saint of Charity, and it has spread from the Crown Prince to the nobility and soldiers, mainly in the royal court, and is gradually spreading to the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the Church does not recognize Amy as a saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are asking for evidence of everything, but I don&#8217;t understand why they haven&#8217;t done something that should be readily apparent by checking the status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from the way she spoke at that time, she seemed convinced that she had received the blessing of the Saint of Charity, the same as the heroine of the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if Amy is unaware of such a simple thing or if she is knowingly keeping a lid on it and ignoring it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But either way, Amy is already crazy and I don&#8217;t know how many people&#8217;s lives will be ruined by that woman if we let her go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the worst-case scenario, it may become necessary to have Anna recognized by the church as the Ice Saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if that were to happen, it could be said that Anna should be placed under the protection of the church. Of course, this may not happen, but it would certainly complicate matters since a saint is a symbol of authority in the church.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to get rid of Amy as soon as possible, but unfortunately, it is frustrating that things are not going that easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, given the current national strength of the Ramslett Kingdom, there is no way to face the Est Empire. If I bombed them, I might be able to win a small scale battle, but we don&#8217;t have enough soldiers or bureaucrats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we go to war in such a situation, we will end up exhausting the people unnecessarily, and there will be nothing to be gained for either side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, if we side with the Est Empire and Centraren falls, we&#8217;ll be bordering the Est Empire, and that&#8217;s not good for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, It is a bad idea to lend a hand to one side and meddle with the other when the enemy and the potential enemy are fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then what do we do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the enemy of my enemy is my friend theory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we can&#8217;t move, we just have to get someone who has the same immediate interests as us to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I came to Kielburg, the largest city in the northern part of the Centraren Kingdom, with the Buitor Rev. This area is the stronghold of the Second Prince&#8217;s faction ruled by Duke Schleistein, and the Second Prince himself is said to be here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, we want to talk to this Second Prince&#8217;s faction and get rid of the Crown Prince and Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used 【Concealment】 to get into the town without any problems, and after a quick check of the town gossip, I broke into the duke&#8217;s mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that, him&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slightly younger boy, who looks much like the crown prince, is walking around the mansion with a well-dressed elderly man. Perhaps that is the second prince, Ludwig and the Duke of Schleistein. As I recall, the second prince was three years younger than the Dauphin, so he must be 13 or 14 years old now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I got closer to them and listened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gregor-dono, I think we should immediately take revenge on that poisonous woman and stop my brother from being driven mad by her! I don&#8217;t think Oscar&#8217;s story is a lie either!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gregor is the name of the Duke of Schleistein. I think his real name was Gregor Julius von Schleistein.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, I understand how you feel. But for now, let them fight it out. Besides, I think that Oscar&#8217;s story is a bit exaggerated. That poisonous woman indeed has the power to drive others mad, but it is also possible that Oscar has realized the gravity of what he has done after all this time and is evading responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know where he went after I returned him to Centraren, but it seems that Oscar was here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But Gregor, if this continues then Lurden will fall into their hands as it is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There, let the self-proclaimed Saint of Charity and her congregation do their best. Besides, if Lurden were to fall, Ramslett would have to move as well. At that time, the hero will come out too. And when they have taken it from them, we will take it back again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But that would destroy Lurden! It is the people who will suffer because of it! Shouldn&#8217;t royalty fight to protect their people!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Second Prince&#8217;s tone heats up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it is surprising. How did he grow up so straight with that stupid father and brother? Is it because of him as the teacher?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, please calm down. What you say is exactly right. However, without blessings, you do not have the fighting strength of your brother or the hero. It would be difficult for His Highness to make a significant change in the war situation even if you were to appear.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. I had never heard about the second prince&#8217;s blessing. I guess it was not kept as a secret, rather he never had it in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why the Crown Prince with the blessing of〖Hero〗was given such preferential treatment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Second Prince is not satisfied with the situation, and he is still trying to get at the Duke of Schleistein.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ggh. But! But! How many of our people do you think will be sacrificed!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, folks are numbers. It does not matter what happens to individuals. A government cannot be formed if a person in Your Highness&#8217;s position is concerned about individual people. As I have said many times, as long as things are going well as a whole, that is all that matters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, if Your Highness gives alms to one needy person, you must give to others as well. But it is impossible to do so. Is that clear? Be a king who sees the whole and not the individual and rules the country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know. I know, but &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. He doesn&#8217;t know what you are implying, so you&#8217;re just changing the point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crushing political enemies and adversaries at the expense of the people is quite different from saying that royalty should not give special treatment to certain individuals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the fact that he is unable to properly refute this is probably a sign that the second prince is not ready yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, your concern for your people is very admirable. But now is the time to endure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuh, I know &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Second Prince said so with regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps a country with the second prince at the top might be able to come to terms. And maybe the Duke of Schleistein can be dealt with if done well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm, now what to do?</span></p>
