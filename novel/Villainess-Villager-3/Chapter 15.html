<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Villager A Meets the Prisoner of War</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why do I have to talk to those guys?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I questioned the soldier who came to call me, not hiding my grumpiness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But he insisted on it. Even though he&#8217;s a prisoner of war, he&#8217;s still the Crown Prince of the Centraren Kingdom, moreover, he asked me to bring his acquaintance Allen-dono. Also, I don&#8217;t think there is any danger because everyone is tightly restrained.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, that&#8217;s a hassle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll also go with you and talk to him. Besides, even if I can&#8217;t use the sword, I&#8217;m already good with magic. If it comes to it, I&#8217;ll protect you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. I&#8217;m most worried about Anna&#8217;s personal safety&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t believe that after all they have done, they would still want to have a word with me, even though they have turned their swords against us as an enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder which one is the saint and which one is the villainess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I came, unwillingly, to the room where Amy and her reverse harem were being held.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the room, the five of them stared at me with eyes as if they were avenging their parents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone is tightly bound behind their backs and gagged except for the Crown Prince and Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the soldier on guard has left the room and is waiting a short distance away from the door, as there may be some private conversation. Also, Anna has been asked to wait in front of the door instead of going inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince noticed me and immediately commanded me in a condescending, pompous tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey. Commoner. Release us now. It&#8217;s treason to rise up against the royal family!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this guy still talking like that in this situation? Is he sane?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Do you think you can do this to me, the Saint of Charity?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, this woman has not yet awakened from her dream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey? More importantly, unravel the rope?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, I don&#8217;t know what she was thinking, but she suddenly changed her attitude and even made seductive advances with a goofy act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disgusting!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you really think you can ensnare me with something like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignore Amy&#8217;s unpleasantness and inquire, looking straight into the Crown Prince&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to confirm something to Your Highness. The one to secretly sell Anastasia-sama to the Empire and forged the Jade seal was Your Highness, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I inquired about that, the Crown Prince nodded without any signs of being afraid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m the King of the future. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this. Besides, the Empire wanted that woman. Moreover, if it brings back the Bruseni region, then that&#8217;s good! That is the responsibility of the nobility!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did you make a deal with that Günther, the Magic Division Commander?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! If only you hadn&#8217;t interfered, we would have gotten Bruseni back bloodless!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Did you really believe that ridiculous story and got in on the deal?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy-sama, did you know that story? No, was it Amy-sama who instigated it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy then snorted and said in a triumphant manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph, isn&#8217;t it obvious? That woman is there to be messed up and become a weapon of the empire. I&#8217;d rather you praise me for doing the right thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder where the goofy act from earlier went.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince immediately affirmed Amy&#8217;s remarks, and the remaining three nodded to Amy and the Crown Prince&#8217;s terrible arguments that did not even make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These guys are hopeless. They don&#8217;t even seem to have the ability to make decent judgments anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it seems Markus and Oscar have an atmosphere of recovery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell happened?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In the first place, the Est Empire didn&#8217;t have any intention from the beginning to return the Bruseni region. Anastasia-sama was only one of the pretexts. In the first place, it&#8217;s crazy to invite soldiers from an enemy country and trick the Duke of your own country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boiling point is as astonishingly low as ever. I don&#8217;t think it was this bad in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, people are influenced by those close to them in their life, and the other person was that Amy, not the real heroine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On that point alone, I have sympathy for this Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I&#8217;m thinking about this, Amy is agitating me with her usual supercilious attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But that woman has fallen into the hands of the Empire. She&#8217;s probably enchanted by the Demon Sword by now, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You. Didn&#8217;t you want me to fall for the honey trap?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little confused because her words are too incomprehensible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew it. That woman must have had enough darkness in her heart to be attracted to a magic sword.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the Crown Prince simply believes in such absurd words of Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Are you okay? Why did you believe in the Demon Sword so easily?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, the Saint, is saying it! There can be no mistake!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the door was opened with a clang and Anna, who had been waiting outside, entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Anastasia?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them shouted in surprise, and the other three widened their eyes as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It has been a long time, Your Highness. And everyone else, too. You seem to be as full of energy as ever.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna says hello, or rather sarcastically, and comes over to my side. I gently support her as she leans her body against me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like this was meant to insinuate them. Anna can walk normally now, but she has been forbidden from overdoing it for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And Your Highness. You&#8217;re missing the title? I am now the First Princess of the Ramslett Kingdom. I have been telling you this for a long time, but as usual, you don&#8217;t seem to have learned it at all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wh-what! We do not recognize the Ramslett Kingdom! You are nothing but rebels! Don&#8217;t you think you should be ashamed of yourselves, to be clinging to and supported by a commoner like that, while claiming to be a Princess!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s tone made me and Anna sigh at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, be careful how you speak. Even if you do not recognize the country now, you will soon be forced to recognize it. And I will not allow you to insult Allen as a commoner.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna then stared at the Crown Prince with cold eyes. The expression on her face was different from the one she used to wear for the sake of her country as if she were looking at a piece of filth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen is my fiancé. Insulting my fiancé is the same as insulting me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Engaged to a commoner? Have you lost your mind?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s eyes widen in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. Allen is the hero of the Ramslett Kingdom. He saved me from the dastardly plots of His Highness and the Empire, single-handedly destroyed most of the enemy in the battle against the Kingdom of Xaus, and also successfully destroyed the army of the Centraren Kingdom, which had invaded the Ramslett Kingdom for an unreasonable cause. It is only natural that the Princess of a country would marry such a rare hero. Looking back on past history, there are countless stories of such a marriage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? So you&#8217;re saying he&#8217;s the cause of all those explosions? You refuse to fight fair! You coward!&#8221; (T/N:- childish shit.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, without changing her expression at all, says to the Crown Prince, who is startled, shouts loudly, and for some reason curses at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In other words, this is also a political marriage, though Allen and I are in love with each other.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anna finally relaxed her expression after saying that much, I gently hugged her. Anna responded by hugging me back tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that is why there is no release. Though I think you can go home when the agreement to end the war is signed, so you&#8217;ll have to stay here and be quiet, hmm?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said all that, I noticed the staff on Amy&#8217;s waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Why does a prisoner have a weapon?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly hid Anna behind me and stripped Amy of her staff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Give it back! That&#8217;s mine!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No way, this staff is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s a staff for me, a saint! You, who is not the chosen one, is not allowed to have it! Give it back!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, this staff is familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. This is none other than that staff that awakened Amy as a saint in the game!</span></p>
