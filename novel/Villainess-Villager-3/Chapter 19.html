<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Villager A Celebrates his Birthday</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A short time after the National Foundation Day ceremony, information came in that the Centraren Kingdom had completely lost the Bruseni region. Considering the speed at which the information was transmitted, it is safe to assume that it was probably around the time of the founding ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s a natural result. They brought troops from Bruseni, which was in balance, and attacked Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I can only think of it as a fool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another piece of information that came in was that the Second Prince&#8217;s faction of the Centraren Kingdom had raised an army in the north with the Second Prince as the flag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, unfortunately, the Crown Prince who survived with Amy returned to the royal capital and is ready to gather support mainly in the west and counter these movements around the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as for us, we&#8217;re going to sit tight for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from that, We have no intention of meddling in this conflict. We just need to be careful with Amy, who has become a witch, and are prepared to assassinate her if necessary. We don&#8217;t know what she will do to us if we leave her alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah. Also, a messenger came from the Est Empire saying that they recognize our independence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the establishment of diplomatic relations between the country with the person who killed the Crown Prince and the country that kidnapped the princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, there is no reply from Norsane or Westerdale yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for Westerdale, it is as expected. But for Norsane, it is possible that it is just delayed due to geographical factors, but it is also possible that it is not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Assuming that Norsane is supporting the Second Prince&#8217;s faction, the state approval would make the relationship with the Ramslett Kingdom strange when the Second Prince comes to power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is only hypothetical, but if Norsane were to try to exert a strong influence on Centraren while supporting the Second Prince, then without the territory of Ramslett, the Second Prince would certainly need substantial food aid from Norsane.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the details are not well understood at this point, so we will have to wait and see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, to change the subject, I was able to ask Oscar, who had his wound healed and got his head cooled with Anna&#8217;s magic, about what was going on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation then went something like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oscar. Why does that woman have that staff? And don&#8217;t you know that she became a witch?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna asks Oscar, who is restrained in the interrogation room. He then began to speak without any sign of resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy suddenly said there is a staff for her in an abandoned church somewhere in this country. So I ordered a group of soldiers to go explore an abandoned church in the woods near the royal capital. And there was really a staff just like the one she described.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So Amy has also finally come up with the idea of getting ahead of the time, is that it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it was impossible for me alone to search for an abandoned church that I didn&#8217;t even know where it was, and this staff was a very low priority for me at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I think about it now, it would have been better if I had collected it first, but I was thinking of proceeding accordingly while prioritising the scenario and without making any big moves to stand out. To be honest, I thought that I had proceeded perfectly, but now that I think about it, there were probably quite a few things that were left out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So when Amy touched the staff, there was a light emanating from it. Then Amy&#8217;s body emitted a black aura or an ominous aura, perhaps. Something like that overflowed from Amy&#8217;s body. It was like the apocalypse you see in church frescoes. It was like that. I thought this was bad&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar looks down once in pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I still liked Amy. Unlike the women around me who only saw my face, blessings, and my family&#8217;s money, she understood my problems. Though I don&#8217;t express it, I was really worried about my face, but she understood and sympathized with me without me saying a word&#8230;. Because she was such a woman, I wanted to be with her even if I had to give up my position, and even if I couldn&#8217;t, I wanted to be there to support her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Oscar bites his lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But when you said she was a witch, it kind of made sense. It wasn&#8217;t that she understood me without saying anything, but that Amy was anticipating my problems&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar said that with a forlorn look on his face. The truth is that he didn&#8217;t know about it because of the witch&#8217;s power, but there is no doubt he was doubtful from the very beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar then looked at Anna with a serious expression and apologized to her in a different serious tone than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Princess Anastasia, I apologize for my many disrespectful behaviours at the school. I know that my apology will not be forgiven, but if this head will bring you any comfort, I will gladly offer it to you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. There seemed to be some doubts about Oscar and Markus, but it seems that was the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That may mean that Markus has also been manipulated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oscar, I accept that apology. It is now in the past. Besides, I am happy now as a result. I have nothing against you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar&#8217;s acknowledgement of his wrongdoing and Anna&#8217;s acceptance of his apology marked the end of her relationship with Oscar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I asked him to leave and warned him about Amy, who is now a witch, that if he still has any fondness for her, then he will again get his will twisted and lose control of himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, of course, as is the custom in this world, I heard that we received plenty of ransom money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the eldest son of the wealthy Wimlet Marquis. I haven&#8217;t heard how much, but I&#8217;m sure it was a lot of money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, let&#8217;s return the topic to the Kingdom of Centraren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the Kingdom of Centraren can no longer afford to be concerned about us, and a truce has been reached without a hitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We have enough production to feed our people, so we have no intention of expanding our territory any further. Therefore, we have not attacked Centraren, and temporary peace has been restored between the two countries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as for me, I&#8217;m working again today. It seems that if I officially marry Anna, they will leave some territory to Anna and me, so I&#8217;m undergoing an apprenticeship that also serves as a study for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s not very interesting because it&#8217;s all paperwork, but it has an appeal because I didn&#8217;t have any knowledge of how to read a ledger book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after lunch with Anna, I would work again, and the day&#8217;s work would end around snack time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, it&#8217;s training with Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna has recently recovered enough to run, if only lightly, so I&#8217;ve been able to spend some quality time with her, swinging my sword a bit and practising dance, which is not my favourite thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, today was my least favourite dance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I managed to finish without stepping on Anna&#8217;s foot, so let&#8217;s praise myself that it is big progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s hard to say that I&#8217;ve improved, but I&#8217;m still one step better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After spending the day in this way, it was time for dinner. Lately, we have been eating dinner together as a family, and today I am sitting around the table with the Royal Family of the Ramslett Kingdom and my mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s main dish was beef fillet steak. The meat was so tender that it melted on the tongue, so it must have been high-quality meat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, after enjoying an exquisite dinner, Anna opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, Allen. Do you know what day it is today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Umm&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She may be referring to some kind of anniversary, but I have no recollection of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, wasn&#8217;t this the time last year when I wasn&#8217;t even allowed to talk to them yet?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was impatient, Anna gave me a dumbfounded look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not good, did I offend her by forgetting any anniversary somehow?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I thought so, but Anna smiled and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, happy birthday!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerhard-san, Elisabeth-san, Friedrich-san, and mother congratulate me, who was surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-Thank you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. Why the question mark? Oh, jeez. Here, this one&#8217;s from me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Anna presented me with a beautifully embroidered handkerchief. The motifs were two black and white dragons, a spirit, and Buitor, which were combined to look like a coat of arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This, did Anna?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Well, you know, when I couldn&#8217;t move much, at that time. So, umm, how is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. It&#8217;s very nice. I will treasure it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Anna looked relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I heard from mother-in-law, Katerina, that Allen doesn&#8217;t like to celebrate himself too lavishly. So I did it like this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yeah. Thank you. I&#8217;m not very good at balls like the last one, so I&#8217;m very happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s good to know.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Anna gave me a beautiful smile that I wanted to look at forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also received gifts from everyone else, and for the first time, I experienced a birthday celebrated by someone other than my mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this what it&#8217;s like to have a growing family?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s very&#8230;.good.</span></p>
