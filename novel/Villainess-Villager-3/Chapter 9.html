<h3>Chapter 9 #8211; Villager A Oversees the Negotiation in the Royal Capital</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty, I have come at your invitation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke of Ramslett, good, you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King replied in an arrogant manner when the Duke said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for your efforts in the search for my daughter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? I can&#8217;t have a noblewoman kidnapped in my capital. I&#8217;m doing my best to find her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for your kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What shouldn&#8217;t have happened? Your son is the one who arranged it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m currently watching the meeting between the Duke and the King safely using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. But from the first exchange, I&#8217;m stressed out to no end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to punch this thick-skinned, shameless King in the face as hard as I could, but I held back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, these two are smiling at each other and checking each other out, even though neither of them is serious. The Duke may look like a gorilla, but what he does is like a raccoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Your Majesty. Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, has asked me, his patron, the Duke of Ramslett, to give him an appropriate reward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What are you talking about? He&#8217;s an adventurer under the protection of the royal family and dispatched on my order. There&#8217;s no such thing, is there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no. I&#8217;ve heard that, but are you really saying that? Could it be that he already has degraded eyesight at that age?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much you try, I can&#8217;t reason with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..But it&#8217;s your Majesty who agreed to the transfer of his protection under the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s patronage, right? I have a copy of that document.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What are you talking about? Do you think I&#8217;ve broken my word?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Your Majesty. With all due respect, this is the man who represented my daughter Anastasia during the duel. Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve forgotten that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duel? Huh? What are you talking about? Though I remember there was a trivial quarrel between children, wasn&#8217;t there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A trivial quarrel, is it? Are you sure that&#8217;s what you want to call it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s getting off-topic. Then let&#8217;s move on to the prize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither of them moved an eyebrow as they talked about what had happened so far, only smiling with their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it seems that even this guy doesn&#8217;t lose his temper right away with the Duke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First of all, Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, was the first to destroy the enemy forces in the Bruseni region, and he has earned 50% of all the battlefield achievements, as well as many more. To reward him for this, I ask that he be granted the rank of Count.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the Duke delivered his request straight away, the Great hall buzzed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, 50% of the total war effort is a bit of a stretch, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that if I hadn&#8217;t bombed and overrun them, it would have been the Centraren Kingdom that would have lost Bruzeni.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? Did Duke Ramslett lose his mind? There is no way that such a prize is possible. A mere commoner adventurer can&#8217;t suddenly become a Count! A knighthood at best.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make unexpected demands to upset the other party, and then find a compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s one of the basic tactics of negotiation, and I&#8217;m sure the people around me took it as such.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time, the Duke has no intention of giving in from here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the titles in this country are, in order from top to bottom, where the king and his sons are at the top. Of these, the Duke is a title that is given only to a branch of the royal family, so no matter how I try, I cannot become a duke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a Count, you own a certain amount of land, and in some cases, you have a certain amount of political power, such as taking care of other lower nobles called Baronet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A knighthood, on the other hand, is a one-time nobility that cannot be passed down from generation to generation. They are also called quasi-aristocrats, and they are not given territories, and in some cases, they can buy these titles with money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, it does not matter how much the royal family distributes, it will not hurt or itch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the title of the frontier count, which was used in some countries in my previous life, does not exist. If anything, the Dukes play that role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, not at all. I think that this level is appropriate considering his recent activities. After all, it&#8217;s that Bruseni. It&#8217;s not an ordinary thing. Considering that it&#8217;s possible to re-invade the Empire, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too cheap of an achievement, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke is negotiating with a smile on his face, but the King&#8217;s brow is wrinkled. The King seems to be making an effort to keep his composure, but it is easy to see that he is angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, this is what the Duke is requesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make Allen, the most meritorious Count who rules the Bruseni region that he has seized. And since Allen is under the patronage of the Dukes of Ramslett, he will naturally be made a subordinate of the Duke of Ramslett, so approve that as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the fertile land of the Bruseni region is something that the royal family would like to have at any cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They do not want the land to fall under the influence of the Duke of Ramslett, who is a thorn in their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if we think about it realistically, we can expect an invasion by the empire, so it would not be a wrong decision for the country to keep me there as protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when the King was confronted with this demand, he became furious and raised his voice, just as the Duke had assumed in our prior discussions.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Impossible! No matter how successful my royal adventurer is, such a thing is not acceptable. He shall be knighted. It has been decided. Do you understand?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the King&#8217;s decision was met with a surprised &#8216;Eh?&#8217; from the man next to him who seemed to be in charge of advising the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Your Majesty says that that the knighthood is enough for Allen, the adventurer of the Dukes of Ramslett, to retake the Bruseni region from the Est Empire, something no one has done in 50 years, is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. If you look back at history, those who have played a major role in the war have been appointed Barons or Viscounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a standard, it is customary to be a Viscount when a region or an important city is regained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt that the recapture of the Bruseni region is a far greater achievement than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King&#8217;s assistant overhears something from the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmm, then let&#8217;s make him a Baron. As for the territory, I will send out a message later. Is that clear?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not worth talking about. After all, it&#8217;s the recapture of the Bruseni region. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking for the Count. In the first place, didn&#8217;t His Majesty promise Allen, the adventurer of the Dukes of Ramslett, that he would be rewarded with whatever he wanted, gold, treasure, titles, women, etc., if he kicked the Imperial Guard to the curb and brought victory to the Centraren Kingdom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Our nation has not yet defeated the Est Empire! The war is going on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But your Majesty said that he would be victorious if he would be able to retake the Bruseni region, and issued a written order, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh! So! Even so, there&#8217;s no way he will be granted a Count&#8217;s title! That&#8217;s right――&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Is he even an adult, throwing tantrums like a child? (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">╬</span><span style="font-weight: 400">▔皿▔</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">╯</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to shout something, the man standing next to the King overheard something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s only with the help of my excellent army. Besides, no matter how successful he was in battle, he&#8217;ll never get a Count&#8217;s rank!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, what should he do to get the Count&#8217;s title? Would it be the head of an important person in the Est Empire?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmm? That&#8217;s right. If he can single-handedly take the head of the Emperor or the Crown Prince of the Est Empire, I&#8217;ll consider it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uwaa. He stepped on it with great pinpoint accuracy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, the Duke smiled again, a black smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? By the way, do you remember that I told you at the beginning that my adventurer Allen of the Duke of Ramslett had done more than just retake the Bruseni region?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmm? Was that so? But I&#8217;ve received no such report, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I thought it would be my duty as a vassal to inform His Majesty first, including how to treat it, since it is too great a war achievement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he said that, the Duke took out the heads of Igor, Crown Prince of the Est Empire, and Günther, Magic Commander, which I had brought, from a high-quality magic bag with a preservation function, and laid them out in front of the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? No way?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know these two faces, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, Igor, &#8230;&#8230;the Crown Prince and Günther, &#8230;&#8230;the Magic Commander?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Allen, an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett, infiltrated and brought back the heads of these two men alone. The Ramslett Dukedom has been in close contact with the adventurer Allen. Based on the recent war situation, we believe that the Est Empire and the Kingdom of Xaus are linked, and we have ordered Allen to take the heads of the Est Empire&#8217;s central figures. This is the reason why he left without taking part in the cleanup of the defeated soldiers after completing the recapture of Bruseni.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- It&#8217;s quite funny how the Duke is saying &#8216;adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217; every time he mentions Allen&#8217;s name. (*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≧▽≦</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ﾉｼ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)) )</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King, who had been completely debunked by the Duke, bit his lip and fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After observing the silence for a while, the Duke called out to the King with the same expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, you&#8217;ve been giving false reports to me, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king suddenly looked angry and shifted the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;False reports? What on earth are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You told us that you were being attacked by 100,000 troops, yet you easily defeated them! No matter how strong your army is, there is no way you can defeat an army of 100,000. It&#8217;s outrageous that you lied to me and pretended that the royal adventurer is your own adventurer!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black smile disappeared from the Duke&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty, that is not a false report, it is a fact. Isn&#8217;t it true that there have been other reports besides mine? And my army has repelled them at great cost. What kind of thinking is it to say that? How can you call me a liar and not even thank me for my loyal service in defending our Kingdom? This Gerhard is overwhelmed by this shock.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then a black smile again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sure your Majesty will not say such a thing because you&#8217;re wise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- LOL (*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≧▽≦</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ﾉｼ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)) )</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King was so agitated that he lost his temper and finally uttered a line that he should not have said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu~tsu! Hey! Grab this rude man!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha, Your Majesty! No! You can&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who was waiting next to him stopped him, but the King was heated up and would not stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop me, Chancellor! Do you want to be put in prison too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I apologize for my overzealousness.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So this guy was the Chancellor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the Chancellor left his seat and went straight back to the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Is it okay? You&#8217;re abandoning your support of the king?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, maybe he&#8217;ll be really sent to prison, so he has returned to his usual nature, is that it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so. Then I guess negotiations have broken down. What a pity. Oh, yes. By the way, how is His Royal Highness the Crown Prince? I&#8217;d like to see him fight bravely like royalty once in a while. Well then, I&#8217;ll take my leave now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the Duke stood up and walked towards the exit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the last irony is for the Crown Prince who did not volunteer, but it is also an irony for the King in a roundabout way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because this guy has never been on the battlefield, even though he is surrounded by so many enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that&#8217;s what happens to the child when the parent is like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is why this guy decided to make the First Prince, who was born with the blessing of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Crown Prince at an early stage and spoiled him thoroughly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not the blessings that are given that make a person, but the efforts that are made to live up to those blessings that make a person a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, the Crown Prince only realizes this after the destruction of the royal capital and the loss of everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in this world, unlike in the game, the royal capital will not be destroyed by the hands of the villainess who has fallen into darkness, and Amy, who is supposed to support the Crown Prince, is not what she seems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, what can I say, it&#8217;s partly because of me messing up the plots, but it will be difficult to rehabilitate him now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What the hell are you doing? Get him! Get him!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King was even more enraged when he heard the Duke&#8217;s words, and he shouted orders to the guard knights around him while yelling at them, then the guard knights finally moved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six of the ten guard knights were stationed around the King, which was impressive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke of Ramslett has &#8216;Allen, the adventurer of the Ramslett Dukedom&#8217; who has sneaked into the Imperial City alone and assassinated the Crown Prince and the Magic Commander.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably thought that if they mess with the Duke of Ramslett, there is a good chance that his blade will now turn on the royal family of the Centraren Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But led by this King who doesn&#8217;t understand such things, this Kingdom will be ruined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke of Ramslett, you are hereby detained on suspicion of treason.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Get out of the way! Or you&#8217;ll get hurt!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke threatens, but the guard knights don&#8217;t seem to be backing down. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the four guard knights approached the Duke to restrain him, I fired a non-lethal round at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ga~tsu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Guha~tsu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guard knights, who had been trying to restrain the Duke, groaned and crouched down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umu.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I created a smokescreen and ran through the palace with the Duke.</span></p>
