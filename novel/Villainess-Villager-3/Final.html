<h3>Final &#8211; Villager A Ties the Knot With the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The days have passed quickly since the battle at Lurden and autumn has arrived. Until now, I had been busy freeing those brainwashed by Amy and the negotiations for the end of the war with the Centraren Kingdom, anyway, it was difficult because of these continuous troubles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, we got into trouble when we were asked to give Anna to the church during this de-brainwashing process. The church may have needed to get rid of the distrust they felt by supporting a witch, but we couldn&#8217;t stand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the church in the Kingdom of Ramslett was originally a co-founder of the Ramslett faction, therefore, it was resolved by making the domestic church independent of the church in Centraren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since the basic idea is one country and one parish in the first place, this may be taken for granted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the negotiations for the end of the war with the Centraren Kingdom were a bit of a mess. Gerhard-san got angry and left the table once, which led to a skirmish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other side may have been looking for the best possible terms, but in the end, they settled by ceding part of the granary in the southwest and part of the mountainous area in the southeastern part of the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were lucky to have this mountainous area ceded to us, so the whole area of the Valley of the Flying Dragon with Melissa and Jerome became our territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Centraren, on the other hand, lost a little more than 40% of its territory and even more of its wheat production.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had originally planned not to move the borders as per our prior arrangement, which is why we had nailed Duke Schleistein so many times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, they still have been insisting on it, so I guess they deserve it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if we don&#8217;t do this, we will be watched closely by other countries, and that is something we have no choice about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the Crown Prince, or rather, the former Crown Prince, who had done so much, was punished with a lenient punishment, only stripping him of the right of succession without executing him, by the new king, the Second Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From what I hear, the former Crown Prince is in quite a mental shock and has stopped coming out of his room, and so far it hasn&#8217;t really changed. Well, I don&#8217;t know if he won&#8217;t or can&#8217;t come out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, there is still a huge fire smouldering in that country because the former King was imprisoned, but that is no longer our concern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither I nor Anna have any interest any longer in what happens to the former Crown Prince or the former King.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a waste of time to rehash the past and take revenge now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we are so happy, I want to share that happiness with Anna and my family. Moreover, if I am going to spend time doing that, then I think it would be much more meaningful to use that time for the people we need to protect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, by the way, you may not be interested in this, but the only rumour I&#8217;ve heard about Claude, who was one of Amy&#8217;s Reverse Harem members, is that he is recuperating from an illness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, well, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. As for me, I don&#8217;t really have anything to say about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, today is the long-awaited wedding day for me and Anna. I put on a crisp tuxedo and head into the sacred ceremony. Since this is the wedding of Anna, the First Princess of the Kingdom of Ramslett, many guests from inside and outside the country are in attendance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the Kingdom of Xaus, His Majesty the King, Her Majesty the Queen, and the Second Princess, from the Empire of Est, His Highness the Third Prince, from the United Kingdom of Norsane, His Highness the First Prince, from the Kingdom of Westerdale, Her Highness the First Princess, and from the Kingdom of Centraren, His Majesty King Ludwig, who came to the throne at a young age, his fiancee, the Duchess of Schleistein, and Oscar with a now healthy Markus were also in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- So other than Leo everyone is alive.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, Markus survived and apologized to Anna, which she accepted and forgave him. However, as a result of the series of disturbances, Markus&#8217;s position in his parent&#8217;s home is quite delicate and he is on the verge of getting disinherited. I heard that he is making efforts to clear his name as if he has changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked alone down the aisle of the Wishen Cathedral, where such a large number of attendees had gathered, to the front of the altar, and then turned around to look at the entrance. In the front row of seats, my mother is sitting, along with Elisabeth-san and Friedrich-san, who are already crying raggedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it&#8217;s early you know. But, really, thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short wait, the church doors opened and Anna appeared in her wedding dress, escorted by Gerhard-san. Although I could not see Anna&#8217;s expression, which was hidden by a veil, I felt that she had a look of mixed feelings of happiness and loneliness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They walk slowly down the aisle toward us. It was very amusing to see small children helping Anna walk down the aisle to lift up the hem of her gorgeous dress and veil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they came in front of me. I exchanged a glance with Gerhard-san and took over escorting from him, and then we both went up to the front of the altar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attendees stood up, hymns were sung with the pipe organ playing, and then the attendees were seated again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the priest preached a sermon on love from the Bible and offered a prayer. Then I received confirmation from the priest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Groom Allen, do you take Anastasia to be your wife, to love, honour, comfort, and help one another in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow, in riches and in poverty, to be faithful to her as long as you live, and to remain faithful until death do you part?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I swear.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered without a pause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bride Anastasia, do you take Allen to be your husband, to love, honour, comfort, and help one another in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow, in riches and in poverty, to be true to him as long as you live, and to remain faithful until death do you part?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia pauses only a moment, then inhales and opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I swear.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the priest continues to ask us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you dedicate yourself to one another?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We looked at each other, then answered simultaneously without signalling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;Yes, I offer it.&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a ring was brought before us. This ring was made of precious mithril, and moreover, it was a special ring that Anna had asked that pervert to bless with the blessing of the spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then exchange the ring. Groom Allen, do you give this ring as a token of your love for the bride Anastasia?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I give it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bride Anastasia, do you accept this ring as a token of love from the groom Allen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I receive it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bride Anastasia, do you give this ring as a token of your love for the groom Allen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I give it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Groom Allen, do you accept this ring as a token of love from the bride Anastasia?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I receive it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then exchange rings.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I put my wedding ring on Anna&#8217;s hand and she puts hers on mine. I always hold Anna&#8217;s hand, but today, perhaps because she is wearing a wedding dress, I feel strangely nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then lift the veil and kiss your bride.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The priest urged me to do so, and I gently lifted Anna&#8217;s veil. There I see the face of Anna, the most beautiful woman I love in the world, with a gentle expression on her face and a slight blush on her cheeks, and yes, how can I say it, she is irresistible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Allen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry, I was fascinated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;stupid.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this exchange in a whisper, I gently kiss Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then sign your marriage certificate.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and Ana each sign, and finally the priest signs as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, a couple has just been born who have made a vow to God. No one will be able to separate them. The wedding ceremony is now closed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how Anna and I became a married couple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I escort my beloved down the aisle. There are several familiar faces that I had been too nervous to notice before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Margaret and Isabella, also master and the senior adventurers in the back, and even Monica-san, are in attendance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, aside from Monica-san, master and the senpais looked totally out of place in their suits, which seemed to be borrowed, and I chuckle a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we passed by them, the doors of the cathedral were opened. When we stepped out through the doors, we were greeted with a thunderous cheer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t believe, so many people have come to celebrate!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san, Anna-chan, you&#8217;re finally husband and wife, aren&#8217;t you? Congratulations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen-san, Anna-san, congratulations!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun are standing in the plaza in front of the cathedral. Melissa-chan wears a ribbon on her tail and Jerome-kun wears a tie. Both are custom-made with the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Ramslett sewn into them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Melissa-chan, Jerome-kun.&#8221;</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we thanked them, a small baby dragon appeared between Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun. Her name is Ciel-chan, and she is Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun&#8217;s beloved daughter. Like Melissa-chan, she has a beautiful pure white body. However, her eyes are golden, just like Jerome&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kyu!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Ciel-chan came trotting up to us, making sweet noises. We have been there many times already, and Ciel-chan has grown quite fond of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We gently stroke Ciel-chan, and she squints her eyes pleasantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took Ciel-chan in my arms and together we climbed into the basket that had been prepared in front of us. Normally, we would have paraded through town in a horse-drawn carriage, but Melissa-chan&#8217;s idea was to have Jerome-kun fly with the basket hanging in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Melissa-chan, it was probably just a matter of getting them to participate, but this performance in the presence of dignitaries from various countries must have been quite shocking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the basket with us on it floats softly into the sky and moves along the street, maintaining a height of about 5 to 6 meters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The street was full of people waving at us. As we waved back, my eyes met Anna&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We smile at each other, and I tell Anna how I feel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, thank you for marrying me. I will make you happy, I promise. I love you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Allen, me too. No, the wedding is already over, isn&#8217;t it? All right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna looked determined as she said this and then gave me a very, very gorgeous smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, I too. I love you. I will always make you happy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan, who was listening to it, muttered as if she was amazed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? You two are going to help each other and be happy, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, I look alternately at Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun, and then at Ciel-chan, who is squirming around at my feet.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, when I looked at Anna, I nodded broadly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Yeah. Anna, let&#8217;s be happy together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, Allen. My husband.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We looked at each other and kissed in a passionate embrace amidst the constant congratulations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ringoon, Ringoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the cathedral bells rang out solemnly in the enthusiastic town of Wishen.</span></p>
