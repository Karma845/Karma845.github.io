<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Villager A Settles the Battle</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The town of Lurden was plunged into a panic when Jerome-kun appeared out of nowhere. Jerome-kun flew low in the sky while intentionally releasing a roar, causing the soldiers and townspeople to run for cover with expressions as if it were the end of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the roar of this dragon is a unique ability of the dragon species that, when exposed to it, the weak ones are dominated by fear and become immobile or slow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In most cases, it is difficult to move against this roar unless you are at least level 25 or have a very strong heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, some of the soldiers still attacked even after being hit by the roar, but their attacks were repelled by Jerome&#8217;s hard scales and failed to inflict even a scratch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna releases the brainwashing of such soldiers from above Jerome-kun with the Holy Ice Awakening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, we made a forced landing in front of the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the soldiers who had come out to intercept us had already fallen under Jerome-kun&#8217;s roar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He-here, all I have to do is knock everyone out, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, please.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, don&#8217;t think as if you are in a m-mud boat, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna and I landed on the ground and were about to run toward the gate. But a familiar person called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oops, Allen-boy, you can&#8217;t leave me here, can you? This world is guided by the Saint of Charity. And to have such a woman dress like a saint is blasphemy against her, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell, even master has fallen prey to that woman&#8217;s poison!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, there is nothing to be upset about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of thing is within the realm of expectation, of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out of my pocket the specially made gun loaded with non-lethal rounds for duelling and fired rapidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Gah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master kneels as it is, and Anna shoots the Holy Ice Awakening there. Then master&#8217;s head was engulfed in ice, and it cracked immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, hmm? Why am I in such a place?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master, having come to his senses, is looking around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? It&#8217;s Allen-boy, isn&#8217;t it? Why are you here? And what the hell is going on?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master noticed me and asked curiously. Anna saw this and called out to master.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are Allen&#8217;s swordmaster, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen-boy. Who is this beautiful lady dressed as a saint?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Master. She is my fiancée and the first princess of the Kingdom of Ramslett, Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Geh. Ramslett&#8217;s princess? Ex-excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Master hurriedly kneels to Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s fine. More importantly, do you know where I can find a woman named Amy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy? Ah, ah, that Saint of Charity-like person. Hmm? Huh? Hmm? Uh, come to think of it, why did I ever think of that woman as a Saint?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, master who seems to have remembered the past little by little is twisting his neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is the power of that woman. More importantly, do you know where she is in the castle?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I didn&#8217;t go in and out much, but I heard she is sitting on the throne these days, probably?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That woman, I&#8217;m sure His Majesty the King is still alive&#8230;&#8230;. Well, okay. Come on, Allen. Let&#8217;s stop her!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Excuse me, Master. Oh, and please get out of here as soon as possible, okay? Both I and my mother now live in Wishen, so if you come over there, we can help you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah? Oh. Be careful! Allen-boy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once we were inside the castle, I created a smokescreen to hide ourselves. Then, holding hands firmly with Anna, I activated 【Concealment】.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is also something I discovered through a lot of research for this time, that 【Concealment】 can hide people or things as long as they are in close proximity to the user.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure if this was possible because I had been using 【Concealment】 so much that my skills had leveled up, or if it was possible from the beginning, but I found out that it was possible anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- probably from the beginning, cause his weapons were invisible.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, with Anna&#8217;s guidance, I easily made my way through the castle to the front of the throne room. Then I waited for the messenger to come and followed him to the throne room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, there was Amy, sitting proudly on the throne in a flamboyant dress, with the Crown Prince and Markus on either side of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In mangas or games, this is where the quarrel with Amy will start with the statement &#8216;Your evil doings will end here!&#8217; or something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m not going to be stupid enough to show up here to blabber on and increase the risk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I no longer care about Amy beyond my hatred for what was done to Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We came here simply because Anna and the people we are supposed to protect would be in danger if we left them alone and because the world would be a mess, so we came to kill them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that&#8217;s really all there is to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, we&#8217;ll end it with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, goodbye.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held Saiga up, pointed the muzzle at Amy&#8217;s body, and pulled the trigger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doon</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ggh, gah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a surprise! Even though they should not be able to react, Markus intervened between Amy and us and took her place to protect her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A&#8230;my, I&#8217;m glad&#8230;I&#8230;was&#8230;protect&#8230;A&#8230;my&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, the strength slowly drained from Markus&#8217;s blood-soaked body.</span></p>


 <p style= "text-align:center"><strong>2</strong></p>
 
 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Noooooo, Markus! Why! Markus!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Amy crying and the fact that I have shot and killed a person I knew, doesn&#8217;t even bring up feelings of sympathy for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only the question, &#8216;How in the world?&#8217; is swirling in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, apparently I&#8217;ve been pretty ruthless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it&#8217;s too late now after all that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hold Saiga again to shoot the next bullet at Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the Crown Prince shouted that and closed the distance between us at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Anna pulls out the 『Sky Knight sword』 and prevents the sword of the Prince with it. Sword clashed with sword, and a metallic sound echoed through the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia! Get out of my way! This guy! If it weren&#8217;t for this guy!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince delivers the next blow in an attempt to eliminate Anna. The move is much more sophisticated than what we saw in class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This must be a〖Hero〗buff which he has put on himself. If I had been hit by this, I probably would have been killed with a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Anna easily parries the Crown Prince&#8217;s sword. The Crown Prince, unable to keep up with her movements, easily lost his balance and staggered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, it&#8217;s time to wake up from your dream.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, who said this as if admonishing him, lightly flicks the Crown Prince&#8217;s sword away from him and then hits him with a sharp middle kick to the gut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gah, ha!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince, with his body bent over, grunted in pain and fell to his knees on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The difference in level is so great that it is no longer even a match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having received the blessing of the〖Sky Knight〗, the blessing of the〖Ice Saint〗, and with the training through high-speed dungeon traversing of the Wind Mountain Dungeon, Anna&#8217;s current status is an S in both physical and magical power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the〖Hero〗buff on board, the current Crown Prince does not seem to stand on his feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Holy Ice Awakening!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s head was wrapped in ice and quickly broke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? I-I was? A-Amy? Eh? Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna lands the final blow on the Crown Prince, who is confused after his brainwashing done by Amy fell off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ice-bound Holy World!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s body is wrapped in ice by Anna&#8217;s magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s this!? Anastasia! Damn! Oh, Mana, the source of all things, Mana. Become a flame armour and protect myself. Flame armour!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince puts a flame armour on his body. Considering the compatibility, the ice should melt with this, but there is no sign that the ice created by Anna will melt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Why! Ice should melt in the flames!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, that ice is holy ice. It will not melt by ordinary means. You will be taken prisoner as you are.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, damn it! Anastasia!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince glares at Anna with hateful eyes and shouts loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when he shouted, the Crown Prince&#8217;s mouth was sealed with ice and he was unable to utter any more words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming this, Anna seemed to lose all interest in the Crown Prince and turned her back to him, who was still mumbling something, and then turned to Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ready my saiga to make sure I hit her this time. However, Amy speaks to Anna in a theatrical and sweet tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama! Please wake up! This should not be what Anastasia-sama wanted.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the line the heroine in the game told to the villainess who was corrupted by darkness during the final battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand now. In the game, the power of the Saint of Charity was activated here, and it would have weakened the power of the magic sword as it purified some of its despair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Anna here is not trapped by a magic sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even if that were the case, neither the Crown Prince nor Markus, who protects Amy, would be able to fight and defeat the weakened villainess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Lady Saint!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stunned by the suddenness of the situation, the soldiers came to their senses and attacked us. Anna made a small gesture to stop me as I held up my Saiga to intercept them, and then she cast her magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Holy Ice Awakening!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the soldier&#8217;s heads are cooled with holy ice and their brainwashing is lifted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? What? Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldiers, having come to their senses, stop and look around. They don&#8217;t seem to understand why they are doing this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Amy saw this, she was blatantly distraught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hi, hii. Why. Why are you, the villainess, here! What&#8217;s going on? Someone! Someone!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Holy Ice Barrier!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna used another unknown magic and a dome of ice formed between the thrones and enveloped us. Perhaps it is similar to the ice saint magic that restrained the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed Saiga at Amy, but Anna looked at me and shook her head a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s too dangerous to even exchange words, so I&#8217;d rather just shoot Amy now, but apparently, Anna has an idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lowered my gun and nodded a little, Anna nodded back and then approached Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hiii. Someone! Help me! Someone!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy runs away with such a scream and desperately hits the wall of the dome in an attempt to break the ice. But of course, the ice doesn&#8217;t break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, come on. No matter how much you brainwashed them, both Markus and the Crown Prince risked their lives to protect you, and that&#8217;s the last thing you want to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ice Binding.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anna used her magic, the ice restrained Amy. Then, forcing Amy to turn toward her, Anna declared to Amy in an emotionless voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know, I do believe that people should be forgiven if they are remorseful and atone for their sins.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Anna&#8217;s words, Amy, who was spun lightly, had a hopeful expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Amy thought she will save her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I just can&#8217;t forgive you alone. You have seduced and corrupted the Crown Prince and the men who were to be the future pillars of the Centraren Kingdom. As a result, this country has been disrupted so much that the blood of so many innocent people has been spilt.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna said this to Amy with a cold expression I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she changes the tone of her voice and says the following with a hint of anger,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not all! How dare you sell me out to the Est Empire for some incomprehensible reason!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wh-what! Isn&#8217;t it your fault that you weren&#8217;t attractive as a woman!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy responded hysterically to Anna&#8217;s anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it&#8217;s not even a rebuttal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, what kind of nerve does she have to immediately respond in this way to someone whom she should be trying to beg for her life?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That man and I were only engaged for political purposes. Even if there was an obligation, there was no love. But still, how dare you try to defile my chastity! And, even inflict such fatal wounds on Allen as well!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna takes her strong anger out on Amy. However, for some reason, Amy is bullishly trying to make a strong comeback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, hmm? But that&#8217;s too bad. You&#8217;ve been defiled by dozens of men. Serves you right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, what the hell is going on already? Does she even know what&#8217;s the situation right now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu. Sorry to disappoint you. My chastity is safe. The Spirit of Light protected me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Anna said this with a triumphant look, and gently touched the fairy&#8217;s hair ornament with her right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy with a strange voice is glaring at Anna with a terrible expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At first. Like Allen, I too thought about how quickly killing you will solve everything. But when I saw what happened to Markus, after breaking the brainwashing of His Highness, and also by the time we came here, Allen&#8217;s swordmaster, and all the other soldiers whose brainwashing I had to break, I changed my mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, she immediately looks hopeful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, seriously, I don&#8217;t get it. What is going on in this woman&#8217;s brain?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words that came after this would not be positive in any way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. I won&#8217;t take your life. But let me take that voice away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy&#8217;s eyes widened when she heard this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Silence reigns in the ice. There is no sound in the silvery world. O my holy ice! In the name of Anastasia Kleiner von Ramslett, I command you. Silence the voice of Amy von Bleiess, the frightening Witch of Envy who stands before me. Holy Ice Voice Seal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Amy&#8217;s throat was entwined with ice, which quickly shattered and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy flutters and then turns blue when she realizes she can&#8217;t speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now this woman can never speak again. Come on, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a small nod and wrapped the Crown Prince and Amy around the ice using the rope I alchemised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, you&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Let&#8217;s escape while taking these two with us. No, before that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna said so and went to Markus, who was sinking in a pool of blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It may be too late, but something may work out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Anna uses Holy Ice Awakening and Holy Ice Healing in quick succession. Markus was then enveloped in holy ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was he still breathing at least once?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is very unlikely that Markus would survive a shotgun blast to the body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even though Markus was obsessed with Amy, he was one of the guys who had been harassing Anna for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Markus was her enemy, she still extended her hand to him, as expected, Anna was definitely chosen to become a saint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I&#8217;m sure she wants to treat the soldiers who have fallen in the battle outside. But that&#8217;s not possible because Gerhard-san has forbidden it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, we&#8217;re getting out this time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus we escaped from the royal castle, dragging Amy and the Crown Prince on ice while releasing the brainwashing of every soldier we passed. Then we rode on Jerome&#8217;s back and headed for the main camp where the Second Prince and Duke Schleistein were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! Br-brother?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness the Crown Prince!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Second Prince and Duke Schleistein spoke in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We kidnapped him from the royal castle ourselves. As promised in advance, the Crown Prince will be handed over. Please do as you please.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince is mumbling and protesting, but I don&#8217;t know what he is saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, what about that witch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. My Kingdom of Ramslett will give appropriate punishment and dispose of her. Her voice has already been silenced, so she will not be able to do anything worse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so……&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But we&#8217;ve done almost all the important parts ourselves, you know. Your Excellency the Duke, we are looking forward to working with you, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We then flew away with Jerome-kun, leaving behind the Duke, who replied tartly, and the Crown Prince, who was freed from the ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, Anna. What are you going to do about this woman?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. I heard that this woman has been saying for a long time that she hoped I would be messily raped by a bunch of thugs. As a woman, I don&#8217;t understand why she would think that way at all, but I thought maybe if she went through the same thing I went through, I would feel a little better about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s, well…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. I heard that the mines hire prostitutes for a very high salary, but it is still a tough job. Therefore, I hear that there are only a few who volunteer for it and are soon forced to quit. The only ones who remain are those like this woman who was sent to be executed instead. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, who is pinned in ice with a pale face and her mouth agape, was trying to say something, but her voice never uttered a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, our battle with Amy, ended.</span></p>
