<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Villager A Heads for the Royal Capital</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After it became known that going near Miri-chan with insolent thoughts will result in getting paralysed, or life-threatening, none of the servants fell victim to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that the Duke and Friedrich-san can&#8217;t help but think about various things and have been caught by the pervert&#8217;s auto defence several times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say that they had ulterior motives, I&#8217;m not talking about kidnapping or anything like that, but about trade, technological exchange, or using the connection with the elves to improve the status of the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the first time, they were trying to lure her with sweets to make her want to come back to the Duke&#8217;s residence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, to be honest, I thought she should let them get away with that much, but I guess that pervert can&#8217;t forgive when it comes to Lolis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I&#8217;m full of the feelings of &#8216;what they&#8217;re wondering&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah. When the maids apologized to me, I found out that I was suspected of kidnapping children or having an illegitimate child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, I don&#8217;t do that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, thinking from the maid&#8217;s point- a commoner man who was allowed to enter Anna&#8217;s room suddenly returned with a hooded child, is not hard to understand how I could be mistaken in this situation&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she stayed for two days after that, and as a three-year-old girl, she did whatever she wanted and caused a storm at the duke&#8217;s mansion before returning to her home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Miri-chan didn&#8217;t say &#8216;I want to come again&#8217; but said &#8216;Bring Anna to play with me&#8217; to me, so the plan of the Duke seems to have failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah, and that pervert didn&#8217;t ask for any compensation whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I dropped him off at the elf village, he said to me, &#8216;When you get married and have children, bring them to me.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can I say, I thought that there are times when she is a pervert, and also times when they call her selfless Wise Sage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she was still a pervert, but for a moment I thought that maybe she was just a pervert who liked children.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, well, no matter how it turns out, a pervert is a pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it&#8217;s important to say that I tried holding her hand, kissing her, hugging her, and many other things, but it didn&#8217;t work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t know what is the key to waking Anna up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that a little time has passed since I returned Miri-chan to the elf village, I think it&#8217;s time to sort out the situation here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the Kingdom of Xaus, which had attacked with a large army, lost most of its troops and withdrew. Peace has returned to the territory of the Ramslett Dukedom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite a blow for the Ramslett Dukedom to be deprived of its stockpile of wheat and to have its invaded city plundered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, thanks to a solid claim for damages against the Kingdom of Xaus and a response of almost full compensation, the balance of income and expenditure seemed to be quite positive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may be due to Friedrich-san&#8217;s power at the end of war negotiations, but the main reason seems to be that the defeat was too great for the Kingdom of Xaus to ignore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the Duke, the army that attacked us was over 100,000, which is almost all of the army that the Kingdom of Xaus can mobilize for an expedition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is estimated that only about 20,000 to 30,000 returned home safely after being defeated by the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s army of only 10,000.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this gap is exploited and the Kingdom of Xaus is invaded, it will be the Kingdom of Xaus that will be cut off from its territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the Duke had asked for reinforcements, but the royal family did not send any reinforcements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, all negotiations for the end of the war were conducted by the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that there is no problem with this because this Kingdom is like a feudal system, but it&#8217;s also strange that they didn&#8217;t send reinforcements to defend the Kingdom&#8217;s territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, was it because he had refused all cooperation and asked for the disinheritance of the Crown Prince?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I heard that the eastern front against the Est Empire ended up in a stalemate after I left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the Centraren Kingdom, which wants to defend the seized Bruseni, and the Est Empire, which wants to reclaim it, are in a state of a slow standoff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since we had captured the fortified city of Cardassia and taken all of the Bruseni regions, I had met the victory conditions that the king had mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, this should be no problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I think they should either quickly make peace with the Est Empire, or increase their forces and push them a little further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, unlike in the game, the war is overwhelmingly in our favour, so the possibility of the destruction of the royal capital has been greatly reduced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless the king makes a very stupid decision, that is&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m currently riding in the Duke&#8217;s carriage to the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why we are heading to the royal capital is because the Duke has been summoned by that King, personally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s willing to negotiate for my reward, but the Duke&#8217;s assessment is that he&#8217;s most likely aiming for assassination or house arrest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, according to the Duke&#8217;s secret agent, the King says that I&#8217;m the royal adventurer he discovered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be frank, I don&#8217;t know what that means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, taking into account the various circumstances, he came to the conclusion that the king was thinking of eliminating the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I totally agree with that idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we discussed the various possibilities and came up with a few plans. Some plans would be to fight, some would be to bow, but if things keep going like this, it would be the plan to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if the plan is to fight, the country will be divided and the people will be forced to sacrifice a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, as a final negotiation, the Duke dared to go to the royal capital, knowing that it was a trap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the course of that discussion, I told him about my blessings and skills. I would no longer have to hide anything from the Duke since we would now be in-laws.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, to my surprise, the Duke knew that I had a skill or blessing other than the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke predicted that I would have assassin-related blessings, or a type of skill that hides my appearance, a skill that specializes in the use of some kind of dark weapon, and the skill of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">No Chant</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and that I would have something more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was right for the most part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as expected, the blessing of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind God</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">was unexpected and surprised him a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, well, that&#8217;s why the Duke, who knew about my blessings and skills, decided to take me to the capital as his shadow escort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we make a mistake here, the country will be divided, so we can&#8217;t afford to lose the Duke at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why I want to do everything in my power to prevent that from happening, and take a path that will minimize the damage to the people who are just living in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke and I share the same feelings, and I&#8217;m sure Anna does too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, we rode to the royal capital with a fragment of hope.</span></p>
