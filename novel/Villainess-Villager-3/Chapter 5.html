<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Villager A Asks the Pervert for Help</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan and Jerome-kun have returned to the Valley of the Flying Dragons before I knew, and my Buitor Rev. sits alone in the spacious yard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t get the chance to thank them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was gazing out the window, a maid came to call me, and I was invited to have dinner with the Duke and his family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when I saw someone I never imagined would be there, I was so surprised that I thought my eyeballs would pop out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother!? Why are you here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you surprised? Well, it&#8217;s good to see Allen&#8217;s surprised face.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the Duke with a frown, asking him to tell me first, but his face showed that he was very pleased with himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re okay. When I heard you were hurt, my heart almost stopped, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hugged my mom for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Allen. Take a seat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, I brought your mother with me when I withdrew from the royal capital. You and Katerina-san are the people under my protection. When I say I will protect you, I will protect you. It is a matter of course.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke said in a matter-of-fact manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to thank him for still giving me advice and keeping his word even after such a rude outburst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I was trying to figure out how to get my mother out of the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And today we&#8217;re having dinner together because Katerina-san is going to be family, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When mother heard this, she looked around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My daughter is not well and hasn&#8217;t regained consciousness yet. However, my family, the Duke of Ramslett, has approved of my daughter and Allen&#8217;s relationship.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Yes. You did your best. Congratulations.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, my mother hugged me tightly and patted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m already a head taller than her, so I bend down and let her do it, but it&#8217;s embarrassing to do it in public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we talked about Anna&#8217;s current situation again, and mother had a sad expression on her face when she heard about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, about the selfless Wise Sage Loringus, I actually have an idea. Can I take Anna somewhere tomorrow?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. The doctor said to keep her on absolute bed rest. Besides, where are you going to take her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a place deep within the lost forest where Loringus-sama last disappeared.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke wrinkles his brow when I say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to go see the elves that are rumoured to exist, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Anna and I are both acquainted with the elves of that village. That hair ornament that Anna wears all the time is a very special one, a fairy hair ornament given to her by the Queen of the Elves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I see. That hair ornament. I heard that the maids were creeped out by the fact that it was back in Anna&#8217;s hair before they knew it, even though they had removed it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. In that village, there is a spirit of light that was born for the first time in 800 years, and that spirit may be able to do something about her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, can I ask you to do it for me? After all, I&#8217;m worried about moving Anna now. If you can bring them here, it would be better. Of course, I won&#8217;t harm the spirit-sama, and I can guarantee the safety of her companion if she has one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how I decided to go see that pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next morning, I launched the Buitor Rev. from the yard. However, it was going to be a long flight from the south to the north of the kingdom, so I landed at the airport in Ruhrden, took a short break, and then headed back to the Elf village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the sun was about to set, I landed at the airport in the Elf Village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah? Allen-san? It&#8217;s unusual for you to come at this time of year. Hmm? Where&#8217;s your wife?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, a few things happened. I&#8217;m here on an errand for Her Majesty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Well, take your time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The autumn days are often said to be the time when the sun drops quickly, and although it was still light earlier, it was already getting dark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Majesty, it&#8217;s been a long time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, Welcome. What did you come here for today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve come to make a request to Rho-sama, the Spirit of Light.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, to Rho-sama? Miri, come here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Miri-chan came to me. Next to her, of course, that pervert was flying along with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, Allen. Carry me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held Miri-chan, who ran up to me. Her weight hasn&#8217;t changed at all since that day in the summer, and I can tell that she hasn&#8217;t grown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, I knew you&#8217;d be here soon.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert comes up to me and whispers in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean when you say I&#8217;ll come?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Somehow, that girl seems to have been in a terrible situation for a long time! I was surprised that the power of the blessing I gave was being used more and more! So explain to me, what happened? &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, I explained the situation to the pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, the irregularity the day before yesterday was caused by the magic sword? Even I didn&#8217;t expect that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the only reason why Anna was not controlled by the magic sword was that this pervert kept sharing his power through the fairy hair ornament to prevent it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bow my head to the pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for protecting her. And, please. No, I beg you! Please heal Anna.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, I whispered so that only the pervert could hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The doctor told me that the you before your rebirth could do something about her&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, the pervert whispered in my ear with a troubled expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even I can&#8217;t heal everything. And I don&#8217;t know if I can heal anything from here, it&#8217;s too far away. That&#8217;s why you have to bring her here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; The doctor said absolute bed rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s true. Well then, take me and Miri-tan with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the pervert said that, I hesitantly asked her Majesty if I could take her out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, Rho-sama? Um, she is asking me to take Miri-chan along with me&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. Rho-sama, Allen-sama, please take care of Miri.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was expecting her to say no, but she easily gave me permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how the pervert and Miri-chan decided to go with me, but is it okay to take such a young child out of the village?</span></p>
