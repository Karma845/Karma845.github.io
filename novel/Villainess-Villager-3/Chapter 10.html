<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Villager A Escapes from the Royal Capital</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I use my wind magic to blow away the soldiers blocking my way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My magic power on the guild card was already at S. I realized that I had reached the same level as when I had thoroughly strengthened Markus in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my physical strength is still at C, probably because I haven&#8217;t been working out hard enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s tremendous. Allen&#8217;s wind magic.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke says so as if he is impressed, but this is probably thanks to the blessings of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Wind God</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really glad that I was able to help Jerome-kun with his wedding arrangements at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I don&#8217;t have time for such sentimentality right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, over here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After meeting up with the Duke&#8217;s bodyguards who were waiting in the waiting room, we pushed our way through the soldiers standing in our way and ran out into the town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we ran down the main street, and after a short distance, we entered an alley. After running through the intricate alleyways, we came to the entrance of the sewers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll disturb the capital as planned. In the meantime, the Duke and the others should go through the sewers. I&#8217;ll return from the sky after I escape alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, be careful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke also, please don&#8217;t make Anna sad by dying here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Oh. That&#8217;s right. Can&#8217;t die until I see my grandkids.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke smiled and disappeared into the dark sewers without looking back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve already done a preliminary survey of the sewers with one of the Duke&#8217;s attendants, and there&#8217;s a squad hidden at the exit of the sewers to escort the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do is distract the soldiers so that they don&#8217;t get to know that the Duke and others are in the sewers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a dangerous mission, but with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> skills, it&#8217;s the perfect job for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close the entrance to this sewer and lock it with </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Since I can transform the shape of things, this is easy enough. I can only thank the Lurden Store for selling me such a cheat skill at such an unbelievable price.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I need to hide using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and immediately start a diversionary strategy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing to do is to create a foul-smelling commotion near the center of the city. The gas, which emits a strong odour like rotten eggs, is sealed with thin ice and set off one after another around the guard posts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When this dissolves, the stench begins to drift.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was bad for the people on the street, the amount of gas was not harmful to their health if they were outdoors, so it was not a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also poured a warm liquid that smelled strongly of ammonia on the bodies of the soldiers on guard duty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ammonia is just a reference, but there is a prospectus that the pungent smell will make people notice it right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was, how to say it, very effective, although I felt like I had done a very bad thing because the people started distancing from their friends immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, after creating a commotion of stench and fake filth near the centre, I moved on to the north gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then this time, a bomb with little or no lethal effect detonated i.e, a bomb with reduced pressure to reduce the explosive force and prevent fragments from flying around, caused a commotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, I had an idea and bought some flour and put it in the bomb, which also helped to create a fuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flour rising up from the ground looked like it was on fire, which made a great impact. The idea was a success as it attracted a large number of soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made sure that there was no fire, so it didn&#8217;t turn into a dust explosion. However, if there was a spark somewhere and it ignited, it would have been a disaster, so I stopped at once&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm. I guess I got a little carried away. I&#8217;m sorry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, there&#8217;s a reason why I&#8217;ve been creating a diversion from the center to the north gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory is located to the south of Lurden. Therefore, you would normally think that the duke would break through the south gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the aim is to make people think that they are trying to draw the troops away from the South by creating a commotion in the North.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the real goal is to divert attention away from the sewers, so it is fine if the troops gather in the north, or conversely, if they focus on the south. Furthermore, they may even search the central area thoroughly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they get a little confused and act in a meaningless way, then my plan is a success.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Satisfied that I had made commotion to some extent, I finished my mission on the north side and headed for the east gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, the east gate was tightly closed. It seems that the order not to let the Duke escape has been conveyed to them in one way or another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, according to what I overheard, it seems they&#8217;re saying that the Duke has gone mad and tried to harm the King, and that&#8217;s why the capture of the entire Duke&#8217;s family was ordered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that this order has been issued means that there is a good chance that a subjugation army will be formed against the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, it seems to have turned out to be the worst possible pattern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the situation is different from the game, it seems that the fate of the overly powerful Duke of Ramslett, who is marginalized and ostracized by that foolish King, has not changed after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there is no doubt that the presence of a foreign character, which is me, has greatly twisted his fate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Anna had gone through something like that, I hadn&#8217;t given up hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke, Friedrich-san, and Elisabeth-san are still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I work hard towards my goal, I can twist that fate as much as I want.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I&#8217;ll just do what I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached the gate for the general public while hiding using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Then, I process a good flaming liquid on the spot, put it in the straw I had brought and lit it on fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lit straw burns in an instant and then spreads to the wooden gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden outburst of fire sent the East Gate into a state of panic. I quietly left the scene as the soldiers scrambled left and right to put out the fire.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;They say the hens will be cackling tomorrow night. I ploughed the field yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~Gacha~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door was unlocked, and I went straight into the Lurden Store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Welcome. I see you&#8217;re back safe and sound. What can I get for you today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I came to scout. Sooner or later, the royal capital will be in turmoil. Before that happens, Would you like to come to the Dukedom of Ramslett?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, But you&#8217;re the one who overthrew the Est Empire, aren&#8217;t you? For the hero of the Kingdom to say such a thing, Is this a civil war?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what you think, but I want to continue trading. That&#8217;s what I came to say. Sorry to interrupt.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s all I said and left the store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I walked through the dark back alley to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild. There, I secretly handed a letter to my master, Monica-san, and the rest of the adventurers who are my acquaintances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might be a wanted man, so I didn&#8217;t show my face. I secretly left the letter on the desk or tucked it into their pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content is, of course, a request to leave the royal capital and not to be hostile to the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially when it comes to war, adventurers are likely to be hired as mercenaries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that happens, I may end up having to kill my seniors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be selfish of me, but I don&#8217;t want any of the people who have helped me to die here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure they will listen to me. It was frustrating that I could only believe that, but it was not good to stay too long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing everything I had to do in the capital, I walked out of the east gate, which got burned down when the fire spread during the day.</span></p>
