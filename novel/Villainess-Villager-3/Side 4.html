<h3>Side &#8211; Anastasia (1)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unleashed the most powerful anti-personnel magic available indoors and stabbed Leonardo to pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Allen! hold on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, Anna, sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, hold on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, blood &#8230;&#8230; on your hands.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen is concerned about others, even in a state like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care about that. Don&#8217;t die! Hey! In a place like this! Hey! Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Allen was able to ask for me with great trouble!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, finally, we were supposed to tie the knot!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something like this! Something like this!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, God!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see the light slowly fading from Allen&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No! Don&#8217;t die! Don&#8217;t leave me alone!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face is probably a mess of tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen! Don&#8217;t die! Don&#8217;t leave me! Allen! Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Allen&#8217;s body suddenly lost power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone. Please! Heal Allen! I don&#8217;t care what happens to me! Please!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ O you who seek guidance! I recognize your strong desire and grant you strength. ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next moment, a brilliant light enveloped my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, ah, this, this is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment that light subsided, I was suddenly convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull out the piece of chair that is stuck in Allen&#8217;s body and cast a spell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Buried in the ice are the sprouting seeds. Melted water is a blessing that brings life. O Holy ice, I command you in the name of Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett ・ Heal my Allen&#8217;s wounds ・ Holy Ice Heal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I know this magic. Why ice magic can even cure is also something I don&#8217;t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I am convinced that I can save Allen in this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, my magic covered Allen&#8217;s body with ice, and soon Allen&#8217;s body was completely trapped in the ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My Lady! Allen-dono!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-this is-&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain the situation later! Those guys are getting away. Get them now! I don&#8217;t care if you have to kill them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ha-hah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the soldiers chased after the fleeing Crown Prince and the others. Afterwards, with father and others, who came later, I returned to my room with Allen, who I had put on ice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why did you arrange a meeting? And what were the guards doing!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, about that. I don&#8217;t know why, but when that woman said it to me, I felt like that for some reason.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father is questioning the soldier who was on guard, but his answer is not making any sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At first, I laughed when that woman referred to herself as a Saint, but then I began to feel that she was right&#8230;.Also, His Highness the Crown Prince, ah, the royal family of the Centraren Kingdom, said that it&#8217;s natural to talk to the classmate from the same school&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that why you had them meet?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Father held his head and let the soldier leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What the hell is going on? He would not have been foolish enough to make that decision. That&#8217;s why I left it to him&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Father, Allen called that woman a witch. From the looks of it, he was using a Blizzard Phoenix magic stone, so he was probably doing a character appraisal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Witch &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a pause, my father changed the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And Anna, what is this all about? Why did you put Allen on ice?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is &#8230;&#8230; I heard a voice from the staff that woman was holding, and then I was surrounded by light. Well, I don&#8217;t know, but somehow I was convinced that if I did this, I could heal him.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the block of ice that enclosed Allen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Indeed, the wound seems to be healing, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, most of the wounds that were so severe have already closed up, and the pieces of the chair that may have remained in Allen&#8217;s body seem to have been expelled from his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have never heard of ice healing magic. And what is with that staff?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That woman said that the staff was the sign of a Saint and that she was recognized by this staff, and had become a Saint.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But in Allen-kun&#8217;s character appraisal, she was a witch.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, maybe&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Father thought for a while and then suggested to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, let&#8217;s check your status. Something might have changed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I was to have my status appraised, and crystals for appraisal were brought to me. This is a very expensive magical tool, but every noble family has one of these in their house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without the adventurer&#8217;s guild card, this crystal can be used to find out what blessings, skills, etc. one has.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, this could be done by registering with the guild, but aristocrats do not want the guild to have their information, so they do this to check for themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held my hand over the crystal and there it appeared with surprising results.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><b>Name:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett</span></p>
<p><b>Age:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> 17</span></p>

<p><b>Magical Power:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> B</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, umm? Father? What is this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? What the hell is going on? Ice Saint? 【Holy Ice Magic】? Moreover〖Sky Knight〗!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly understood what had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am sure that this staff, this staff gave me the strength I needed to save Allen&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This staff is&#8230; isn&#8217;t it a dangerous staff that creates a witch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I can only assume so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the ice that sealed my Allen cracked. Then immediately the ice shattered with a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move my body, which is still not well, as hard as I can to get to Allen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His body was cold, but I could hear his heart beating, and as I held him tightly, I could feel the warmth slowly returning to his body.</span></p>
