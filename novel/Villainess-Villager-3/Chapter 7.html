<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Villager A Let the Pervert Check the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, I see, I see, what! This is unacceptable. Who on earth did such a terrible thing! The one who did this must be crazy!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert is touching Anna&#8217;s forehead and is upset about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m grateful for her help, but I can&#8217;t help but feel a little nervous about letting her touch Anna because I feel like it might taint her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this is also for the treatment. I don&#8217;t have a choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ll tell you the results. Miry-tan, can I borrow your body?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the pervert said that, Miri-chan gave a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the pervert entered Miri-chan&#8217;s head, and Miri-chan&#8217;s head hung.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-sama gasped in that situation and hurriedly supported her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Liza. Miri&#8217;s body is now being moved by me, the Spirit of Light. My name is Rho, and I am related to the selfless Wise Sage Loringus.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Lo, Lorin, gus&#8230;. sensei?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched warmly as Elisabeth-san&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not so twisted that I&#8217;m going to get in the way here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Liza, your daughter seems to have grown up to be a very strong and kind-hearted woman. And you, as a mother, have become much more respectable. Loringus is very happy to see your growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, oh, oh, sensei!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san hugged Miri-chan&#8217;s little body and cried, without fear of being seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert, who is moving Miri-chan&#8217;s body, held Elisabeth-san&#8217;s head in her small hands and gave her a gentle pat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at her and, no, I won&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, Elisabeth-san began to calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry for such a shameful sight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the pervert smiled using Miri-chan&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smile of the beautiful young elf girl was truly angel-like. So, Elisabeth-san also couldn&#8217;t help but smile as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But knowing what&#8217;s inside, I just can&#8217;t accept it normally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this pervert is a good pervert, but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh. I guess some things in the world are better off not knowing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really. Oh, really. &#8230;&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, let me tell you the results of the diagnosis.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert said this with a straight face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s conclude. The soul of Anastasia is now sleeping deep in her heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, will my daughter ever wake up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She&#8217;s not dead. So, in theory, she&#8217;ll wake up, but at least I can&#8217;t help with that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wh-What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san looked like she was about to cry, and I couldn&#8217;t help but ask her for a solution in a stronger tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right now, Anastasia is in a state where she has sealed her soul to herself. And if she hadn&#8217;t done this, her soul would have been torn apart and lost by now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, then, why don&#8217;t you just break that seal?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ask the pervert with a desperate feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But I don&#8217;t know the key to unlock the seal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The power that triggered the seal is my power. When I blessed Anastasia, I made sure that I could lend her my power through the fairy ornament. Since it is my power, I naturally know how the seal was made. But since the seal is for the protection of her soul, it cannot be easily broken.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, she took a breath, and then the pervert continued speaking again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You will need a key to unlock the seal. It could be a person, an object, a memory, a place, or something that this girl truly cares about and looks forward to. If we can find out what the key is, it will be easy to break the seal. But if you force it, the soul will be broken and lost. Once that happens, it can&#8217;t be undone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san covers her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So there&#8217;s nothing I can do right now. You&#8217;re better off looking for the key to the seal. Oh, and I don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s wearing the magic sealing collar, but please leave it on until she regains consciousness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? No, this is the one those guys put on her&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. So that&#8217;s what it is. Even if you don&#8217;t have the key, it will come off if you break it. You don&#8217;t need to worry about it because it will simply prevent you from using magic. However, if you take it off in this state, there is a risk that the magic will break out somehow. So, please do not remove it until she regains consciousness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so &#8230;..I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really feels like a Wise sage when I hear this kind of thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why she looks like a different person to me anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;More importantly, please lead me to the magic sword that put Anastasia-san in such a state.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded and headed to my room with Miri-chan and Elisabeth-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I opened the door and walked out of Anna&#8217;s room, for some reason, I found the Duke and Friedrich-san sitting while leaning against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maids were worried about these two people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Dear? Friedrich?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. They will be able to stand up soon. This is what happens when anyone who has insolent thoughts about my contractor, Miri, tries to approach her. If they really wanted to harm her, it would have taken their life, so the fact that they were able to get away with such a thing suggests that they were thinking of something of a calculative nature. Now, please continue with the lead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">S-Scary. The pervert&#8217;s passion for little girls was really not half-baked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had this kind of auto-defence then, no wonder the Queen allowed her to go out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? So that means me and Anna also?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it was on my face, because the pervert answered my question as if he had read my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, that&#8217;s right. Neither Allen, Anastasia, nor Liza had any evil thoughts of looking at Miri and using her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, no. Wait? You&#8217;re the one who &#8230;&#8230; uh, yes. I&#8217;m not going to say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when we entered my room, I offered her the sheath that contained the magic sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, so this is the magic sword&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert gives instructions by gesturing to put it on the floor. Apparently, it is too heavy for Miri-chan&#8217;s body to hold it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the pervert looked at the sword placed on the floor, the sheath-like wrap I had made returned to the sand and the magic sword revealed itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert grips the handle placed on the floor without hesitation with Miri-chan&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s dangerous!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say that, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like anything special happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. After all, it seems that there is no doubt about it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pervert muttered so sadly and used some kind of magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dazzling light enveloped the area, then quickly converged on the magic sword and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The magic sword has now been sealed. Please take this to the Elf village. This sword should not remain on the outside.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This sword is a magical sword made from the souls of numerous young children who were repeatedly abused, betrayed by loved ones, and killed in despair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m utterly disappointed with the content.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There should be no one in the human world who can purify this. If anyone can do it, it would have to be a saint, especially a saint of charity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? The saint of charity?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but ask back at the unexpected word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. A woman who has received a holy blessing and has had her wish granted by a sacred object is called a saint. However, in the past, there were saints who were good at healing, saints who were good at blessing, and even saints who fought with their fists. Among them, the saint of charity is the saint who specializes in prayers and words to save the hearts of the dead, the weak, and the wounded.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. It&#8217;s all connected to one existence. So that&#8217;s what it means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But as far as I know, there is no such person in this world right now. If that is the case, then it would be better if I were to purify it little by little over the next few hundred years in the Elf village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Oh.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Rho-sama! Please, please take care of it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san, who said that, seemed to be moved by tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, then I leave the rest to you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, the pervert quickly slipped out of Miri-chan&#8217;s body. Elisabeth-san hurriedly supports Miri-chan, who is about to collapse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the pervert who came out of Miri-chan&#8217;s body opened her mouth and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m so tired. As expected, this kind of thing makes my shoulders stiff. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No more&#8230;.. I won&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>
