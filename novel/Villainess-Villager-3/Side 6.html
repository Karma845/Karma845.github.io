<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (4)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Huh? I don&#8217;t understand!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How come the villainess and the nerd are still alive?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I, the Saint of Charity, am wanted as a witch, aren&#8217;t you crazy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, how dare you say it&#8217;s okay to kill me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you so afraid of me, the Saint of Charity?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s probably right. After all, she is the villainess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of things that are confusing but wait and see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;ll make it easier soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about that, I got some unbelievable news.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? The territory of the villainess was recognized as a country? What&#8217;s more, the kingdom of Xaus, which was supposed to be fighting them, recognized it and sent a princess to the ceremony?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on top of that, the engagement of that nerd and the villainess was announced, was it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, Markus burst into our room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness! Something terrible happened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What happened Markus?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leo is! Leo is!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about Leo! Did he come back!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-that is&#8230; in the c-coffin&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Leo&#8230;is? De..ad?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, my eyes went blank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then Karl-sama hugged me and held me close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, oh, but yeah.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m still okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, I can&#8217;t believe they killed Leo!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leo is a capture target, unlike the villainess and that damn nerd mob, you know? Why did you kill him?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, the heroine and the Saint of Charity told you to come back at any cost, so you have to come back to me! What were you thinking?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……Unforgivable!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my Leo! How dare you!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama! Leo! Avenge Leo!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All right. I&#8217;ll kill them for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. We should have just killed the villainess and the nerd quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a Saint of Charity and was too nice to them, so those scum took advantage of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- No, you&#8217;re an idiot.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will not fail again!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know, Amy. But if we don&#8217;t do something about that coward&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me! Your Highness!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is it, can&#8217;t you read the air?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, the Saint of Charity too. You are very beautiful as always..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, thank you. You&#8217;re very good.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I answered as the Saint of Charity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?! What&#8217;s the matter?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah. The front against the Est Empire has collapsed and all of Bruseni has been lost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! What did you say!? Didn&#8217;t the report say that Cardassia wouldn&#8217;t fall, even if it was pushed back somewhat?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems that there was a secret passageway that we did not know about, which was used to attack us from within the city walls.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tch, then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah. The sudden appearance of enemy soldiers in the castle confused our side, and we lost half of our men, who were crushed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Half of them, you say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah. And the Est Imperial Army, which has defeated the whole of Bruseni, is now further organizing its forces. It is likely that they will soon begin their march towards Lurden.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No way? Are you saying that the royal capital will fall even if the villainess is not there?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I, the Saint of Charity, am here, you know? Yes, that&#8217;s right. we will not lose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get it. This must be the last boss battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- For once she is right.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m here. Karl-sama. I&#8217;ll support everyone in this fight!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. We have the Saint of Charity with us. We can&#8217;t lose.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As long as we have the Saint of Charity, there&#8217;s nothing to fear!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My words motivated everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. Now is the time to show my power as the heroine!</span></p>
