<h3>Side &#8211; Amy (5)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha. I didn&#8217;t think the power of the Saint of Charity was so strong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King, the ministers, and the knights, all agree with me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it bluntly, it all seems like brainwashing now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been a very smooth ride, especially since that Prime Minister gave in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the power of the Saint of Charity only works on those who have a liking for me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you know what? If they like me even a little bit, it will definitely work, and if I keep on telling them, they will definitely listen to what I say and change as I say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the Prime Minister seeing through it, all the people in the castle are mine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told them several times that I am the Saint of Charity, that they should believe in me unconditionally and should offer their everything to me. After that, they started to believe in me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then for the general populace. The Prime Minister gave a speech in which he simply read from a manuscript he had written, and intentionally staged the healing show of the wounded soldiers. Oh, and then doing charitable work or something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, after doing something like the act of a nice human and telling them about myself, they immediately believed that I was the Saint of Charity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love Karl-sama and others. So I have no intention of becoming their Queen, but it&#8217;s practically like my own country now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I heard that Oscar was released, and his father, who seems to have switched sides to the second prince faction, caught him and took him somewhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t even been able to contact Claude for a long time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s strange that after writing letters to both of them I didn&#8217;t get any response?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I had captured them properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;m sure we can talk about that later, right?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was looking out the window by myself, Karl-sama came in after finishing his work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran to Karl-sama, and he gently embraced me. Then we kissed passionately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, I missed you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama with a neat face is always nice to see.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Markus!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markus came to me too. Then Karl-sama let me go and left me with Markus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, I missed you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Markus also hugged me tightly and kissed me passionately, just like Karl-sama.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re both here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because I only have Amy. Amy&#8217;s happiness is my happiness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too. I would do anything for Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. Karl-sama, Markus. I love you, too. So love only me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, of course.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would never look at another woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that so. As I kept asking them to love only me every day, they soon became like this. Now they don&#8217;t feel anything when they see any other woman but me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s perfect. No one will complain about this kind of thing anywhere in the castle anymore. No, in fact, they&#8217;ll look at you fondly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, I&#8217;ve been in bed with them, and it&#8217;s fulfilling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Amy. I just got word from the church that they&#8217;re recognizing you as the Saint of Charity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, finally!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so happy with Karl-sama&#8217;s words that I let out a loud voice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I was steadily persuading them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I steadily met with priests and sisters of the church and gradually persuaded them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially the support for the orphanage was effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to an orphanage and taught the children there that I was a Saint. The children immediately believed that I was the Saint of Charity, you know? With sparkling eyes, they would say, &#8220;Saint-sama, Saint-sama has come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I didn&#8217;t really want to be with those dirty orphans, but when I put up with it, the sisters and priests there started listening to me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So little by little, I got good rumours going, and by the time I realized it, there was no more talk of witches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today, I was finally recognized by the Church as God&#8217;s chosen Saint of Charity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now there&#8217;s no one left to bother me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufufu&#8230;now all we have to do is to deal with those Imperials out there.</span></p>
