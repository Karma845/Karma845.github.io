<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Villager A Worries about the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We succeeded in returning to the territory safely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently the escape from the sewer was unmarked, so the Duke and his men were able to join up with the troops that had been put on standby without any problems, and succeeded in returning to the Duke&#8217;s territory at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My return method was the original Buitor that I had hidden at the airport in the forest northeast of Lurden, but after getting used to the improved model, I found the old one a little difficult to fly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was satisfied with the improvements that had been made, and at the same time, it shook my engineer&#8217;s spirit to make more improvements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know when it will be, but I&#8217;d like to build a glider like the one I flew in a previous life, with a double seat, or a light plane with more seats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I heard that the situation in the Royal Capital has not been good since then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the lords heard the King&#8217;s decision this time, their reactions were divided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, the southern aristocrats, who were firmly united around the Duke of Ramslett, supported the Duke without a single defection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a result of the fact that the groundwork had been laid quite well in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the lords who are threatened by the Est Empire in the east have not made their stance clear, but many of them seem to take a position more in line with the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two reasons for this. The first is that, if the food supply from the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory is cut off, then there will be territories that will starve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how fertile the land of Bruseni is, it is obvious that the Imperial Army will mess with the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, it will take a long time for production to recover since they have expelled a significant number of residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, is it still a long-standing grudge? I don&#8217;t know why they drove out the inhabitants, but I hope they will learn from the Roman Empire, which treated its conquered people well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in this world, there is no way to know about ancient Rome, and in the history I learned here, there is no empire as huge as that one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, let&#8217;s get back to the story. The other reason is my existence as an adventurer of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My one-sided bombing and overrunning of the Est Empire is already well known, especially to the soldiers who participated in the Battle of Bruseni in the east, and they have experienced its power firsthand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s reassuring while I&#8217;m on your side, but the moment I turn against you, it turns into a nightmare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, there was no way to shoot me down except by attacking me during takeoff and landing, also bombs and incendiary bombs were raining down from above almost without limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such an opponent, it was no longer a matter of maintaining morale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, the Est army had clearly lost the will to fight in the middle of the battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, on the other hand, the nobles in the west and north are supporting the royal family, taking the opinion that the Duke of Ramslett should be eliminated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, many of the nobles support the current King and Crown Prince in the west and the second Prince in the north, so while they are ostensibly condemning the Duke of Ramslett, they are also in a state of internal strife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the King has emphasised the order of the subjugation of the Duke of Ramslett, a rebel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, despite the King&#8217;s order, when it comes to actually sending troops, the lords are reluctant to lose their own soldiers or those of their own faction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a messy situation that I&#8217;ve heard of in world history, but I&#8217;d be grateful if my opponent could actually get stuck in such a situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke, on the other hand, mercilessly took action.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, he stopped the export of wheat outside his territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ostensible reason for this is that it was plundered as a result of the invasion by the Kingdom of Xaus, but the reality is different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, it wasn&#8217;t the time to sow wheat seeds, so the damage was not as great as it was said to be, and the Ramslett Dukedom was not hurt since they got more compensation from the Kingdom of Xaus than they got plundered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As proof of this, distribution to territories that support the Duke of Ramslett, such as Margaret&#8217;s Altmunt and Isabella&#8217;s Luinberg, is still permitted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this wheat embargo cast a huge shadow on the lives of the common people living in non-Ramslett ducal territories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The price of wheat is rising day by day, and in some towns, the price of bread has already doubled within a week of the start of the embargo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt sorry for them, but I couldn&#8217;t just sit by and let the King&#8217;s arrogance get the better of me. There is no choice but to make my heart a demon here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing that happened was a huge migration of adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adventurers make their living by hunting demons and conquering dungeons to gain treasure, but due to the nature of their work, they are allowed to move to other cities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the price of wheat skyrocketed, many of these adventurers moved to the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory or other cities that were self-sufficient in wheat. Some of them are said to have moved to the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory in anticipation of the war demand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among them, Margaret&#8217;s Altmunt is said to be particularly popular, and I&#8217;ve heard that a considerable number of adventurers have travelled there for the Orc&#8217;s meat that can be produced in the Great Dungeon of Orcs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only hope that master and others are included in this group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, so far we are following the plan that I discussed with the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are a few things I envision for the future, but there are still many uncertainties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, it is necessary to watch how the Est Empire, which has lost two of its important people, and the United Kingdom of Norsane, which has yet to make a move on the political changes in its neighbouring countries, will emerge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the situation is unpredictable as to what the non-Ramslett faction lords will do as the food situation worsens as time goes on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished my work for the day and came to Anna&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, my job is to help the Duke with his political affairs. In this situation where the Duke&#8217;s territory is in need of even a cat&#8217;s paw, there is no room for idle play. (T/N:- cat&#8217;s paw is depicting shortage of personnel.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good evening, Anna. The stars are shining beautifully today too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to her, but she didn&#8217;t respond at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maids who serve her every day make sure that she is well-groomed, and she looks fantastic, as beautiful as an elaborately made sculpture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently lifted Anna&#8217;s body and turned her to face me, changing her position to prevent bedsores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time I pick up her body, which has become lighter and thinner, my heart tightens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Listen, Anna? The Duke has agreed to your marriage to me. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s time for you to wake up?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I know that won&#8217;t happen. I raise her up and talk to her while I try to relax her joints so they don&#8217;t stiffen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. The day after tomorrow is Anna&#8217;s birthday, right? It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve been able to celebrate your birthday at the mansion, and everyone at the mansion is really excited about it. So, you know. Wake up, please.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t. I had decided to smile and talk to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started to tear up a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Anna woke up in this state, it would worry her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, good night.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I put her down on the bed again, I lightly kissed her on the forehead and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the moonlight, Anna&#8217;s figure was still so fantastically beautiful, and so fragile that I was afraid she would disappear at any moment.</span></p>
