<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Villager A Helps in Rehabilitating the Villainess</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the morning after Anna&#8217;s birthday, I&#8217;ve been working hard and helping her with her rehabilitation in my spare time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been bedridden for such a long time that her body had become very weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, she could not stand up properly, but now she has recovered to the point where she can walk with support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how long it will take for her to be able to wield a sword and control magic like she used to, but Anna&#8217;s condition is improving day by day, and that makes me irresistibly happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna really wants to use the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sky Knight Sword</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I gave her. Of course, I&#8217;m going to help her, but I don&#8217;t want her to be in a situation where she has to use the sword, so I have mixed feelings about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Anna is smiling next to me like this, and she&#8217;s still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That alone makes me, no, us happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, fortunately, Anna doesn&#8217;t remember much of what happened after the magic sword was placed in her hands. It was a blessing in disguise that she didn&#8217;t suffer a deep psychological scar from the sword&#8217;s mental attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she is afraid of being alone in the dark. She always keeps a light nearby when she sleeps, and Elisabeth-san watches over her at her bedside until she falls asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to be able to protect her so that she can sleep early.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I explained to her the situation since Anna was kidnapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Anna looked very sad when she heard that the King had defended the Crown Prince despite a lot of evidence and that the Crown Prince had never admitted his guilt, also that I killed the kidnappers, and that the Est empire used that and Anna&#8217;s refusal of marriage as an excuse to start the war, that the school had been closed because of it, and that even the students had gone off to war in a student mobilization, albeit on a volunteer basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett and the future Queen of the Centraren Kingdom, Anna has been selfless in making it a better country to the extent that it seems excessive to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was all done out of a sense of responsibility as a noblewoman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is sad to see that what she had built up in this way has not been rewarded and that they are running towards collapse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she was as angry as I was at the King for not recognizing my achievements and trying to get away with only knighthood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t treat people who have achieved so much properly, you don&#8217;t deserve to be in the top position. In fact, isn&#8217;t this the first time since the founding of the country that the whole of Bruseni is under our control?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you ask me, that&#8217;s true. There&#8217;s been a struggle from the beginning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yes. But I wonder when the royal family became like that. In the first place, the founding King became King by taking the lead in fighting to protect his people and defeating their enemies. If you can&#8217;t fight for your people, you should quit being a King.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that Anna shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Moreover, His Highness the Crown Prince didn&#8217;t volunteer to go to war. It&#8217;s the end of the line for the royal family.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna said this and looked far away. She didn&#8217;t seem to have the same &#8216;for the country&#8217; will that she had before, and seemed to me to be someone else&#8217;s problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared at her and thought something silly like, &#8216;She&#8217;s so cute&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong? Do I have something on my face?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna must have noticed my gaze because she looked at me suspiciously and told me so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? No. Anna looking far away is also cute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! Stupid! What are you saying out of the blue!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna who turns bright red after saying that is cute, and Anna who is angry is also cute.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hey! Allen! What&#8217;s wrong with you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, what to say? Maybe I&#8217;m sick.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! Get a doctor so-soon!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw Anna turn blue with impatience, I gave a small laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s an illness of wanting to watch Anna all day.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Anna&#8217;s face turned red again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do-Don&#8217;t say stupid things! I was! I was worried about you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But I was hundreds of times more worried about you than you are about me. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m happy that you reacted in such a cute way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Anna huffed and turned bright red, but turned over and muttered quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay because you came back to me properly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not letting you go again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh geez, I&#8217;m never leaving Allen again.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently hugged Anna, and she hugged me back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathed in deeply as I felt Anna&#8217;s warmth. Anna&#8217;s nice scent filled my nose, and a warm feeling of gratitude for her return filled my heart.</span></p>
