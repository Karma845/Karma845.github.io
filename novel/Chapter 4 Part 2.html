<b>Part 2</span></b>

<p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remembers&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The day that Asahi and Senpai met. On the first night of the first meeting, Asahi opened the window shakily. Senpai, who was leaning on the armrest with her upper body, asked in a light tone. Looking back now, Senpai was probably hiding her embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"See, the moon is beautiful tonight.... I went out to play during the day today, so I didn't notice. Did you move out today? Hey, you're really freaking out, instead of covering it with a corrugated box. Don't you always leave your room normally? You look really cute now, and..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's heart skipped a beat, and he asked back, &#8220;And what?&#8221;. Senpai shook her head&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nothing. Can you tell me your name? My name is Himi Kanako. What's your name?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Senpai smiled- "Your name is the same as the name of a sunny day, so it makes you feel happy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remembers&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">the next night. Asahi glanced out the window through the curtain, Senpai was standing on the balcony at that moment. Their gazes crossed, and a hint of surprise appeared on Senpai's face. Despite hesitating, Asahi opened the window. The senpai said something- "so amazing".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was thinking, would you mind opening the curtains. Then you actually opened it, which really scared me. It actually happened. It was so much fun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi wonders why do you want me to open the curtain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai replied&#8212;"I was thinking, will Amaharashi-kun go to the same high school as me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?" &#8212;&#8212;Asahi couldn't help but be a little surprised. Senpai started explaining to him-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was thinking about what you said yesterday. Then I thought about where Asahi lived before. You said that compared to the previous house, it only took half an hour to get to high school here. Then I noticed that the location of the high school I attended happened to match the conditions you mentioned. I was a little worried, so I checked with the map on my phone, but I couldn't find a school with any other exact conditions."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi told her the name of the school, and Senpai clapped excitedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right! Interesting! Moving on to the next door neighbor, the child in that family will attend the same school as me! &#8230;Sorry, I'm talking to you again today. Since my inspiration suddenly appeared, I want to confirm it with you. If we go to the same school, we can go to and from school together. This is very nice."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The last one is really great. It shouldn't have any special meaning. But to Asahi, it was like a surprise attack, and Senpai's happy smile was really pitiful, Asahi was surprised. An unbearable itching feeling struck, and after looking away, he would pay more attention to this point, which embarrassed Asahi. Because of that, Asahi looked straight at her as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai looked surprised, her eyes were shaking back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...A second later, her body shook. Senpai showed a very happy appearance, and placed her hand on her face on the armrest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remembers&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nothing to mention on the third day. Asahi couldn't help but care, so he looked through the gaps between the curtains a few times. The curtain in Senpai's room was tightly closed. Light leaked from inside. Asahi heaved a sigh of relief, while feeling a hint of regret in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other side of the window, how is Senpai feeling?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi thought about it&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The fourth day. There was a 'click'&#8212;Asahi heard the sound of pebbles being thrown against the window for the first time. Senpai called him for the first time. At first, he thought it was his own illusion, and then repeated it several times, he only felt that it came from somewhere nearby. After a while, Asahi looked up from his notebook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did it come from the bedroom window?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's face appeared in his heart. Asahi walked to the window in a panic and opened the curtains. At that moment, Senpai simply waved her right hand holding a small pebble. There are two left on the armrest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Adding to what Senpai was holding at the time, there were three in total.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Asahi didn't notice in the end, what would Senpai do? Would she stop chatting with Asahi by the window? Or will challenge again the next day? But in the end Asahi still noticed&#8212;after being filtered by the probability sieve, Asahi responded to Senpai's call as a result. However, Senpai tonight, even if she made eye contact with Asahi; even if Asahi opened the window, he didn't show a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi asked: "What's wrong?" &#8212;&#8212;I got an apology.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Amaharashi-kun, I'm sorry"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi asked&#8212; &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was listless and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't think of anything until yesterday. I thought Amaharashi-kun moving here was very interesting, so I was playing around without permission. I didn't think of anything.... Today, I talked to people closest to Amaharashi-kun's house - I just found out about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(&#8230;That family must be very sad. Uh? Hasn't Kanako heard from your parents? Or do you mean your parents don't know? The wife of the family came to our house to say hello after moving&#8212; so I asked &#8220;What is your husband's job?&#8221;, the woman smiled lonely and said to me&#8212;&#8212; &#8220;My husband has died&#8221;. Until this spring, the relationship of his wife, husband, and son who was still in high school was still very good, because it was too painful to live in a house full of memories, and they were about to move here&#8212;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi started to think about how to explain to Senpai. He thought for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My name was given to me by my father." &#8211; Asahi said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My father has a hobby, namely climbing mountains. After marriage, he stopped climbing alone, before he occasionally went to the mountains. Once, he couldn't go down the mountain according to a predetermined plan, so he spent the night in the mountain. Even if he was fully prepared, he was still afraid. In the middle of the night, I can't help but wonder&#8212;am I going to die like this? Will I never see the woman I like again? &#8212;&#8212;This woman is referring to my mother. He slept very soundly and woke up several times in the middle of the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, in the rapidly turning fine weather, he said that he saw a red sun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The red sun shone through the gap between the clouds and fell to the ground, shining on his father's cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that moment, the anxiety, fear, and despair that stained my heart seemed to disappear in an instant. He smiled and said he was just thinking about it. Sunrise is hope. It was like a sharp knife, shattering the former despair with the darkness of the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pretty majestic, isn't it? But because of this, he gave me this name. Life is colorful, full of boredom, sadness, and shame, but this is unavoidable. People were always lost, but he hoped&#8212;in this moment, I could wash away anxiety and fear like the rising sun, and grow with hope. This is where my name comes from, so it doesn't matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is something only my mother and I know in this world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After hearing what Asahi said, Senpai called out the name &#8211; "Asahi."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her tone was like touching a treasure that should not be broken, and she called out several times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi. Asahi, Asahi, Asahi, ...Asahi. Amaharashi Asahi."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai laughed happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun. From today onwards, can I... can I secretly call you with a pebble? If you don't hate it, would you like to come over and chat once in a while?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi replied shyly at the same time &#8211; &#8220;I would be happy&#8221;. Chatting through the window with a neighbor who was as beautiful as a goddess, Asahi felt a deep sense of joy. In the middle of the night, Asahi felt a rising sun in his heart. It's hard to let go, it's scary, it's cheering, it's mesmerizing... the warm feeling will turn into a certain shape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One can't help but want to see where the warm emotion comes out of its form.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remembers, when starting&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212;At first, I thought this was Senpai's wish. Only when the atmosphere is right; only when the time is right; only the moon is beautiful; Senpai occasionally looks through the window and chats with me for a bit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moon hangs high in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The stars shone, and the night breeze slowly passed. Silence enveloped only the outdoor AC unit in my mother's room ringing. On national highways, the occasional sound of passing vehicles will be heard here. In the corner of the field of vision, the street lamp on the tree-lined street was dotted with stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai smiled and looked at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The distance between the windows was just a little over a meter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"At that time, Senpai didn't expect that there would be anyone else in this room, so she was very shaken. Even though I panicked, I still clearly remember: at that time, Senpai didn't even panic pulling the curtain. Strange, but Senpai didn't do this all of a sudden-instead, she walked to the balcony&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hope you can call it a "seed" or "germination". To say it's a fad, like an event that has a certain probability for everyone. Because the facts aren't like this. I didn't say that that night. Come out&#8212;I think the confused Asahi it's so cute and funny. That emotion is the seed... Right now, seeing Asahi blushing and pretending nothing happened still makes me excited."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Senpai's cat ears are cuter"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai laughed twice. As a result, the cat ears on her head shook twice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Is Asahi worried?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When that Senpai said this sentence through her cell phone last night, she had a feeling about it. ... Asahi found Asahi's answer himself. After the incident at the library, this premonition turned into belief. Because of that, he would be fully armed again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi and Senpai finished their appearance in the library, they returned home. Asahi took the bus which was slightly slower than Senpai. After returning, Senpai was already waiting for him in front of the house. It was like a reward for hard work&#8212;she didn't say a word, and showed Asahi the screen of her phone. The phone wallpaper is Asahi. ...It was a photo with cat ears that Senpai took in the previous punishment game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">At 9 pm, after a long time, Asahi opened the window without any hesitation - just like a picture of Asahi, Senpai wearing cat ears. But unlike before, she's wearing pajamas with cute cat patterns, and she's not wearing cat claw gloves&#8212;despite being simple, her destructive power is not to be underestimated. Her courage was enough to shoot down Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remained alert and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. Senpai planted a seed in her heart-so Senpai started trying to communicate with me. Although there are other ways, but in terms of results, we're already like this. We're talking by the window now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how many times they came back, it would definitely be like this. Asahi and Senpai would definitely enter this desolate world&#8212;Asahi wasn't that naive yet. He did feel it a little&#8212;especially in the beginning. Those inconspicuous little interactions can be interrupted at any moment&#8212;very fragile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if it ended abruptly, it wouldn't be surprising.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But it doesn't end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think there are many reasons for this. Maybe because Senpai found my reaction interesting at the beginning; or maybe because Senpai was very happy at the time, so the impression was really good."</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Mh049Gv/17.jpg" alt="17" border="0"></a>

dium;">I said it myself, like a fool. Despite being a bit shy, my appearance wasn't hated by my Senpai&#8212;there was a kind of luck in it too. Moreover, Senpai will subconsciously like Yoru Magach &#8211; Aki Nee-san said before that his appearance is also a manifestation of genetic compatibility. Even though this is what Aki Nee-san casually said, I also wish it in my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rather than appearance, it might be more appropriate to talk about temperament.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Senpai said just now&#8212;Senpai's liking for my expression was probably a bigger factor. ...Senpai just wanted to see me panic and blush, so she would tease me. Even though I can't see my face, I can almost tell what expression I'm showing when I see Senpai's appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe it's because I moved into the house next door by accident, and I'm relatively the same age&#8230; Maybe it's because the schools happen to be the same, which makes Senpai a little excited; maybe because after that, I heard about my father from the nearest neighbor. I think I messed up, Senpai lost a lot of time; maybe because seeing Senpai's sad face made me nervous, I told her the origin of my name; maybe it was because Senpai felt that the period of the story was beautiful&#8212;not only that story, it might also include mine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai called my name just then. I didn't understand it at the time, but now I know how special it is for a Senpai to call the opposite sex. Maybe my name being called from my Senpai's mouth carved a warm power, a mysterious voice&#8230; in the hearts of me and Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's face was full of interest, and she listened to Asahi's words. The serenity was never erased from her face. Senpai leaned forward, lying on the armrest, her eyes up, staring at Asahi. Asahi had heard people say that the cat stared at its owner, acting like a baby.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi couldn't look away from his Senpai. No matter how cute Senpai's cat ears were&#8212;As long as she thought about what to do next, Asahi couldn't be embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course, I also have reasons to continue chatting with Senpai at the window. There is more than one reason. If I mention the reasons for my interest in Senpai, I can list them all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"... Asahi-kun. Today you talked a lot in front of Tsubasa and Shimao-kun, "I like it", right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not enough. Tsubasa and Tasogare-san don't know Senpai, ...of the entire nation that everyone has seen. It's a smile that can pierce other people's hearts-a small demon-like expression Senpai, I can't say a word "hate". This will be doubted by Tsubasa and Tasogare. So, what I said in the library, isn't even half of what I wanted to say. If you ask me where I like Senpai-it's really not enough&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;All in all, even after I moved in, it's been days... even though it's already April; even though I was in high school; even at school we can see each other - we still haven't finished talking by the window. I don't know why we're doing this, and I don't know why this is happening. For Senpai it's true, and it's the same for me. However, I think the most important and immediate reason is very clear&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai is still so calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's what Senpai and I want to continue. Only this, this is not coincidence or luck. Various factors have turned into the will of me and Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;For various reasons, Senpai wanted to talk to me from the window; for various reasons, I wanted to talk to Senpai by the window. However, these emotions are like a thin thread, which can be easily broken if ignored. However, Senpai and I tied this thread together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;Even if she hesitated; even if there are many worries; even if I'm confused whether this is really happening&#8212; Senpai is still holding the pebble in her hand, and I'm still opening the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;The thread keeps piling up day by day, getting tougher and tougher-not afraid of wind and grass. Senpai gradually enjoyed teasing me from the window. I don't know when&#8230; I also gradually want to become the same as Senpai who is like a goddess. The thread becomes stronger and is no longer afraid of being pulled. These emotions gradually began to increase, and would never end-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;because Senpai is so beautiful; because Senpai lives next door to me; because Senpai is so gentle - I would love Senpai, but these words can't tell my emotions. Why did this love in my heart become so big? &#8212;&#8212;I thought about it myself. Only then did I know that I was always thinking about Senpai&#8212;just as Senpai was thinking about me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;This should be the correct answer. This was the answer to an answer that Senpai herself didn't know. That's why&#8212;Senpai will fall in love with me, and Senpai will fall in love."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai is more beautiful than the moon, more mysterious than the clouds, and more compassionate than the stars.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The night wind caressed Senpai's hair, sending a breath of love to Asahi's side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi sure&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If I am different from the current me, if there are fewer reasons to motivate Senpai; If Senpai is different from the current Senpai, if there are fewer reasons to motivate me&#8230;&#8230; As long as there is one difference between these two conditions, there won't be any more everyday like now-but every time</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;between me and Senpai is superimposed like this. There were many happy times between me and Senpai... Until Senpai's so-called &#8220;seed&#8221; was fertilized into &#8220;love&#8221;. I think this is the answer. Everything about me, Senpai, makes this love relationship blossom and bear fruit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's smile deepened, and she was still very calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...But there was one thing Asahi wanted to try. What Asahi wanted to do today wasn't just to solve Tsubasa and Tasogare's doubts and to solve the answers to these questions&#8212;this was only the first round.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi whispered the answer, not wanting to say - How? Am I right?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai said, &#8220;That's how it is,&#8221; and nodded. Apart from the satisfaction in her eyes, there was also a feeling of pleasure - how should I tease Asahi this time? For Senpai, this answer was not the end. Senpai didn't expect Asahi to say some of what she wanted to say. Although Asahi had no intention of doing this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, this means that from now on, as long as these happy times are added together, our love will bloom and bear fruit, right? ...Then, should we start sooner? Asahi isn't afraid of being caught by Tsubasa. Doubt, are you just say half of it in the library?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was sure of this&#8212;that is, saying it would make Asahi very embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What else does Asahi-kun like about me? Can you tell me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi is really shy. Not only this question embarrassed him, but also the look in Senpai's eyes that wore cat ears&#8212;plain and full, but with a lewd expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, Asahi wanted to lift the restrictions created by Tsubasa's suspicions as soon as possible. But that doesn't mean Senpai doesn't feel an itch in her heart. If she was afraid, Asahi would not have come here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Senpai. As long as this time continues to accumulate, this relationship will definitely be more intense. But accumulating more time will grow a more colorful love.... I want to do this&#8212;I want to make the world of silence between me and Senpai go a step further far."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi remembers. ...That night, the window sill was covered in flowers, Asahi and Senpai made it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi jumped onto his Senpai's balcony spontaneously. Senpai at that time could be said to be shaken. This idea should have popped up from then on: maybe&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is uncertain. This aura was so weak that after seeing the Yoru Magach doll, which looked a lot like him, he couldn't forget it completely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the idea was right, Asahi wouldn't pose much of a challenge. As long as you take the wrong steps, you may not be liked by Senpai. Obviously, she hadn't started dating yet-Senpai had already told him in the form of a question-she liked him. But Asahi never said fond words to Senpai. As long as the angle was changed, they would only chat by the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the night of the reunion, his body moved before he even started thinking&#8212; as long as he thought about it, Asahi would hesitate to step on the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But now it's different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it was only for a second, they still kissed in the pouring rain. It was like the Big Bang&#8212; the impact and heat caused Asahi's spirit to break for a while. After calming down, countless trusts grew in Asahi's heart like elementary particles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The newborn universe is more colorful than in the past. Moreover, this was also because Asahi also clearly conveyed to his Senpai that he liked her. Even if it could only express less than half of the emotions in this heart&#8212;but in front of Tsubasa and Tasogare, Asahi had already done his best.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The rest-from now on, you can say anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least there's value in trying it now. Asahi has every right to challenge. Show confidence&#8212;at least, he could tell himself that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi put his hand on the windowsill and begged&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, please go to the side like before.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai, who had been calm until now, opened her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi wouldn't give her time to mentally prepare. Asahi was the same as that night&#8212;but not like that, he consciously put his hand on the wall and stepped over to the window sill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was the same as before&#8212;never thought Asahi would take such an action. On her beautiful face, she was shocked and shaken. Her expression provoked Asahi's affectionate heart. Senpai's surprised expression, her expression enjoying Asahi-Asahi's reaction was so affectionate and affectionate. Every time Senpai showed an expression that would only be shown to Asahi, Asahi's heart would lose its cool.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi knows&#8212; I really like Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Presumably, as long as Asahi panicked and blushed, Senpai would sense this. The other party gives herself as much happiness as herself gives to each other. Asahi had always hoped to be on par with Senpai. Asahi wanted to embarrass Senpai and know this at the same time&#8212;a happiness that made her not even want to do it, Asahi also gave his share to Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi crossed the night again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...the night before. Aki who was drunk suddenly said-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Himi-san is really pouting..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When she said this, the main story of "Aquavit" had just ended, and the TV started broadcasting a collection of cute illustrations, cool music and staff lists.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha?" &#8212;&#8212;Asahi turned his head and looked at Aki. Aki took another sip of the cocktail that increased the concentration of the vodka, and said with emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hate it, that's just from my personal experience. Asahi, it's a shame the type of person who doesn't seem interested in sex at first glance is actually very sexual..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of experience did you have" &#8212;replied Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is the experience I gained after observing my companions. Although there is no beauty like Himi-san, at least there is someone like Himi-san next. Obviously there are a couple of &#8220;Excellent Students&#8221; up to high school. Serious face, you will keep a virgin face until you get married, but once you have a girlfriend in college, you will be lovers and lovers all day long... Why is it only me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's just your jealousy" &#8212;said Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if I put my jealousy aside, this is also true. The so-called top students are that kind of thing, because their sexual desire is too strong, so they will distract themselves and focus on studying..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took out the Blu-ray disc "Aquavit" from the Blu-ray playback and criticized it at the same time&#8212;get rid of your inexplicable prejudice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know how many cocktails Aki Nee-san drank" &#8212;said Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Chicken chicken."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi replied&#8212; "this drunkard, go to sleep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Needless to say, Aki's speech was full of prejudice. Those are all jokes made by drunks. Since his Senpai was too perfect, he expected his Senpai to be like this. I really hope she won't say that her personal feelings are the truth of the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But - joking is sometimes the right answer.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Asahi landed on the balcony, he lost his balance. Even though he wasn't about to fall, he staggered. Senpai subconsciously supported him&#8212;Asahi just stared at her like that. Senpai was surprised, and looked into Asahi's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Except Moon no one can see Asahi and Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how Asahi and Senpai touched each other&#8212;as long as the door to Asahi and Senpai's room was locked, there would be no stopping them from appearing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's face turned red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Of course&#8212; Asahi thought to himself. Senpai slowly let go of the hand that was holding Asahi's arm. Even though Asahi also hit the balcony handrail, his hands were shaking so nervously, but he relied on his own will to resist desperately, and grabbed the palm of Senpai who was about to leave - this was the first time Asahi held Senpai's palm alone. This was not only to prevent her from escaping, but also to re-feel how close the two were.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was not the same as by the window&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not the same as speaking quietly in public&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, in this place, there is nothing that cannot be done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's face trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to Senpai's request, Asahi said something he couldn't say in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I like looking at Senpai's back and looking at me calmly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, now naturally there was no need to turn hatred into likes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No need to care about anyone. Just say what's on your mind. Here, every "like" would penetrate deep into Senpai's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I like the smile that slightly rises at the corners of Senpai's mouth after looking at each other from the window. I like Senpai's hair blowing in the night breeze and glistening in the moonlight. I like that Senpai will always be unpredictable. Even though I'm not at peace but I love the look of Senpai with a satisfied body and shaking after seeing my reaction. I like the way Senpai uses her arms to support her face on the balcony I like Senpai to use it. I'm the sound of Senpai calling me out by throwing pebbles, I like the nervousness when talking to Senpai before 9 pm . I like the smell of Senpai which is occasionally carried by the night breeze&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">" &#8212;&#8212;Wait... Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai blushed and tried her best to let out her voice. She looked into Asahi's trembling eyes&#8212;beads of sweat appeared on her forehead beneath her bangs. At this moment, Asahi realized that his Senpai had always been in this mood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was no need to hesitate - after seeing Senpai's reaction, Asahi immediately understood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;It turns out that Senpai really likes me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sensation of pleasure spread throughout his body, and Asahi couldn't help but tremble.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was impatient.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212;I like Senpai's sweet smell. I like Senpai's cute appearance in pajamas. I should only see Senpai in pajamas at school-I'm very happy. I like chatting with Senpai every day. I like talking to my Senpai about what will happen tomorrow. I like her happy and shining eyes. I like her slightly lonely expression when she closes the window after talking today&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai shouted&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212; Asahi!!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi looked at Senpai intently. In fact, Senpai was slightly taller than Asahi&#8212;but Senpai lowered her head because she was embarrassed, and Asahi's gaze turned upwards. &#8220;Ha&#8212;&#8212;ha&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; Senpai took two deep breaths. &#8220;Plop, plop&#8221; - clenched fists could feel boiling blood flowing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai slowly raised her head with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She called out Asahi's name again&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun, ...uh, listen to me&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8212;&#8230;So, I&#8230;like&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't say the words to deal a fatal blow to Senpai. Senpai slowly let go of Asahi's hand. She took off the cat ear headband she was wearing on her head, and her feet were bashful. Asahi watched&#8212;Even though he had let go of Senpai's hand, he could still feel Senpai's heartbeat. &#8230;&#8230;Wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Asahi's own heartbeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's cheeks were warm too. There was a deep tension in his throat, and a raging flame ignited deep within his chest. Senpai also lost her composure. Since Senpai wasn't shaking from excitement, Asahi didn't notice it&#8212;Senpai's tremors were also transmitted to him at some point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai desperately tried to calm down, but she couldn't.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I, I... I always, uh-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Senpai always can't help but eat the cake in front of her."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi said softly&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where did Senpai's calm come from? Come on&#8212;I thought about it for a moment. Last time, when I came to this balcony, Senpai lost her composure for the first time. Obviously before this, it was only the two of us chatting; obviously we were also nearby touching each other in a short distance - but that night was different.... So, I guess so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi raised his hand and touched Senpai's cheek. Senpai didn't run away, but she tightened her body. In the middle of the night, the face of the red rose that was blooming was very warm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here, there are no obstacles&#8230; Even so, I hugged Senpai tightly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai shuddered shyly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you were at the window, the distance between us would be more than a meter. Even though Senpai would tease me at such a close distance, she would definitely choose a public place with the people around her. She would definitely choose not to be at this time. But maybe there's a place where people will come.... in other words, Senpai chooses an environment that can be controlled by Senpai-I won't lose control and hug Senpai, so Senpai is full of calm. But here it's different... Senpai, is it is there anything else you wish to deny?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai tightly gripped the removed cat ear headband.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her eyes wander. It's not because she's embarrassed, it's just because she's embarrassed that prevents her from looking straight into Asahi's eyes&#8212;Asahi understands this way. Senpai didn't run from under Asahi's palm that was caressing her face, but quipped her body. So time passed for a few seconds. At this moment, that Senpai seemed to have adjusted her consciousness&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ha&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: large;">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;she took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She looked at Asahi again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...There's one thing you didn't say properly. It's not you I want to control. This..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She quickly looked away&#8212;beads of sweat trickled down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want to control myself. I don't want to get in the way of Asahi-kun, I control myself&#8230;&#8230;because I&#8230;like&#8230;like&#8230;Asahi-kun&#8230;&#8230;like, I can't help myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai made a coy voice with an expression she would never show by the window. Her slender shoulders trembled slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That too now-after seeing Asahi-kun's face, my heart is so happy. I really want to run to you and hug you tight... But I have to control myself. I'm scared to see the feeling I can't control not to see you directly so far. Especially when I saw Asahi-kun's face turn red, showing an expression of reluctance&#8212;everything about Asahi-kun is like a rare treasure to me, and I can't put it down. I'm afraid of this feeling in myself&#8230;so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though she was very shy, Senpai desperately said it&#8212;meaning, Senpai really had nowhere to run. It's like saying: Even if you want to pour out your own heart, you also want to get rid of your troubles. If you don't do this, I don't know what will happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So I said wait a minute. Asahi, I beg you. Don't tell me you like me in a place so close, in a place where no one else will come. Keep a little distance&#8212; uh, Asahi said. It's okay, it's all right, so wait a minute, please, wait&#8230; wait a minute, really wait a minute&#8212;!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Asahi tilted his face, Senpai immediately panicked. Asahi's right hand was still caressing Senpai's cheek, and his lips slowly approached Senpai's. Senpai didn't run&#8212;when her lips were about to meet, she closed her eyes tightly instead.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't go up directly, but instead looked at Senpai's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's face slightly trembled, showing shame, fear&#8230; and a hint of joy. Asahi had never seen Senpai show such an expression&#8212;perhaps, she had never shown such an expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi thought to himself&#8212; this might be her own passion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi wanted to be like Senpai&#8212;&#8212; change the color of Senpai's world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, he got a revelation from heaven. He only knew now&#8212; every time Asahi and Senpai's time by the window started to overlap; each time Senpai's love affair got bigger; whenever Asahi wanted to be on par with this beautiful Senpai, started fighting stubbornly&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's world would be changed by him again and again, day after day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's long eyelashes trembled slightly...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Asa&#8230;Asahi&#8230;?&#8230;Asahi!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai opened one eye timidly, and she realized&#8212; Asahi stopped just as he was about to kiss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi put his right hand and touched Senpai's face. Ba-dump, ba-dump&#8212; a heart that beats as if it's exploding in your chest! Senpai who looked angry only noticed this at this moment&#8212;she finally understood one thing. Even Asahi was very shy. Senpai opened her eyes wide and her body couldn't help but tremble&#8212; at the same time, she forced herself to smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi-kun?...You're still a hundred years too early to tease me! Didn't you just say what you like to me with a proud face? By the way, didn't you have anything to say then? What did you say? What are you trying to say? If you can say it, say it? Don't be shy&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;I just wanted to say, I want to be with Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">thump, thump, thump &#8212;If only the sound of a beating heart were the only thing left in the world. Asahi and Senpai looked at each other with red faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't kiss Senpai, it's not because I'm embarrassed. It's because I think back, I wanted to say this but didn't say it. Senpai, please go out with me&#8230;. Or, Senpai didn't intend to be with anyone. Am I in "Anyone"?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">pounding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Asahi really has bad eyes" &#8212;&#8212;Senpai smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know that's not the case, but you still say that.... Of course I can get along with you. But I have one condition-namely, for a period of time from now on, don't jump over the window again.... Even I can stay calm even after you jump over&#8212;you can't do this until I can stay calm. I'm not going to give you any hints."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi recalled the night when it rained, and Senpai suddenly kissed herself. The kiss was only one second. It's like a child in a kindergarten, absolutely no fun. Even so, it still left an impression on Asahi with some sequelae&#8212;in just a second, Asahi's world was turned upside down; just looking at his Senpai, Asahi's heart would move. So Asahi answered-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I will try to make Senpai feel ashamed without crossing this line. I will fight hard-not to give dominance to Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least for now, Asahi wanted to make her heart flutter when she saw Asahi&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">even at the window, Asahi would take her composure&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">-Asahi kissed in the past. This kiss was much longer than a second.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In Asahi's desk drawer, there was an unopened ribbon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This ribbon is in the same series as the Yoru Magach ribbon hanging from Senpai's bag. That ribbon is Yoru's companion &#8211; a liquid that can fuse with everything in the world, and it's an artificial life form in the shape of the Aquavit dragon. The print on the ribbon is exactly the same as the work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Starting tomorrow, this ribbon will be hung on the inside of the school bag, in a position not visible from the outside&#8212;can be swayed at will, no need to care about other people's views. The world that only Asahi and Senpai knew about was once again connected to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This would be a new part of the time that Asahi and Senpai gathered together.</span></p>
