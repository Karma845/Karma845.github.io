<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2 &#8211; Homeroom Teacher</h1><div class="text-left">
				<p class="calibre3">After two months of high school and not attending school once, a teacher finally came to my house. And by the way, he was in front of my room right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t hear a word about a teacher coming to my house, but I guess my mom kept it a secret.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I guess she thought I’d run away if she told me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Can I talk to you for a minute?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The homeroom teacher &mdash; Kiritani, I think his name was? Asked me through the door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shut up, I have nothing to say to a teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I quickly replied.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seriously, he was wasting my time. I’m going to play one more game by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m not trying to force you to go to school. I just want to talk to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani spoke slowly and in a reassuring tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…However, my feelings were completely unmoved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What, he wasn’t going to try to get me back to school? If that was the case, why go this far and come to my house?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So why don’t you open the door?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t have anything to say to a teacher!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I know that. I know that teachers were all talk and no action.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In middle school, Touya and his classmates bullied me every day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The teachers…they may have known about it, at least my homeroom teacher definitely did.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had a lot of insults written on my desk in the classroom and my homeroom teacher happened to be there when I was being beaten up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But my homeroom teacher pretended not to see it, probably because he didn’t want to get in trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was teaching and doing homeroom every day as if he didn’t know what was going on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing him, I thought to myself, “Teachers are terrible.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right. I’ll do the talking and you can listen to me from there. Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani asked me, but I honestly didn’t think it was a good idea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I didn’t think he was going to leave when I talked back to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I had no choice but to listen to what he had to say.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I guess I’ll just turn on the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I used to be a student just like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, in passing, I heard Kiritani say that he went to school in high school to the extent that he would progress through grades, and that all the rest of the time he stayed at home and played video games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He said that he was tired of human relationships because of his personality, which originally made it difficult for him to express his own opinions because he was so concerned about those around him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was at that time that I met someone who changed me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a female student who was in the same class as Kiritani at the time. He said she changed his life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was a person with strong habits who came to school every day wearing a parka, which was prohibited by school rules.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But she was someone who would never bend what she thought was right and never conform to others. She was always herself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As he got to know her, Kiritani also decided to be himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And he became a teacher to help students like himself in the past, even if only a little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is nothing wrong with being a hermit. What I want to tell you, Kenji-kun, is that even if you are shut in, it is important whether or not you are doing what you really want to do right now, whether or not you are living your life as yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, this is also from someone who changed because of others… Kiritani said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From what I’ve just heard, it seems that this teacher actually wants me to go to school. He was different from the teachers I’ve had in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Living your life as yourself… Those words were stuck in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But I don’t really know what it means to be yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still don’t trust Kiritani. …I’ve come to want to talk to him a little bit, though.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Frankly, I don’t think I’d like things the way they are either.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but I don’t even know what to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He might be able to help me with this situation…That was what I had hoped.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A warm voice came back through the door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll help you, and we’ll find something that’s you together.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani, or rather &mdash; Kiritani-sensei &mdash; continued to say this to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hearing his words, the expectations that I had just held grew stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you really going to help me find myself?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked as I opened the door. As I had expected, Kiritani-sensei was weak-looking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Despite his appearance however, he had an air of dependability about him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, Kiritani-sensei was a little surprised to see me. I think it was because I suddenly opened the door and because I was dressed like a shut-in with shaggy hair and shabby clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of course. I’m your homeroom teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei answered my question with a smile. It was a reassuringly kind smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… Can you come back tomorrow?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, I naturally said those words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei replied immediately without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing him like this, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps, this person would really&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">And at this moment, my life started moving again.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“Sorry for the inconvenience.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei greeted me at the door after changing his shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Mom had to go to work on an urgent matter, so it was just me and Kiritani-sensei at home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei, can I ask you a question?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s the matter? You can ask me anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… What kind of person is that girl in the parka who changed your life that you were talking about before?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had been thinking about this ever since I heard Kiritani-sensei talk about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered what kind of person they were who could change someone else’s entire life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, she was the most problematic kid in school and did the most crazy things.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">She started a guerrilla event without the teacher’s permission, or she played Juliet in the “Romeo and Juliet” play at the school festival and changed the ending from a tragedy to a comedy on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was a messed-up schoolgirl.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ehh!? I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I really don’t know if I can count on this person.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So what does she do now?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right now? Right now, she…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei reacted in a way that seemed kind of hard to answer. She would happen to be a bad person, right?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he pulled out his phone from his pants pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Did someone send him a message?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Good.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Kiritani-sensei paused, gut-posing. …What was he doing, this guy?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, about what the parka girl is doing now…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Turning around, Kiritani-sensei continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, what is she doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked again. I hope she hasn’t become a bad person for now…</p>
<p class="calibre3">But contrary to my misgivings, Kiritani-sensei answered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She’s a Hollywood actress.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei looked so happy when he answered that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The person who changed him must be a very nice person.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">The day after Kiritani-sensei visited. I played a game with Marumaru before he arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…No, I certainly don’t think it was a good idea to keep things as it was, okay?</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I like games in general… so I tend to get caught up in them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hm? What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru called me while we were playing together. The game, by the way, was a trendy shooting battle royale game that we played yesterday as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Did something good happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s that suddenly?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because you are playing really well today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as Marumaru said, my gameplay was in top condition. </p>
<p class="calibre3">“You had more than ten kills in three straight games.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Nothing particularly good happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I doubt it… maybe you got a girlfriend?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh!? You really got one!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, sorry. I was concentrating on playing and wasn’t listening.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“C-Come on. Don’t surprise me…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru sounded a little relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-What was it? What about a girlfriend? There was no way I could have a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“R-Right! There’s no way Kinu can have a girlfriend!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru went out of his way to repeat what I said. I mean, don’t you have some kind of follow-up or something?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t even talk to anyone outside of my family, let alone a girlfriend. Marumaru probably is as far as it goes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! Kinu should be thankful to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, yes, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That doesn’t feel sincere at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thanked him appropriately, Marrmaru made a disgruntled sound.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I’m too embarrassed to tell him, but I’m really thankful to Marumaru.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the time when I stopped going to school and my hatred for Touya and Ruri was at its strongest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still thought of Touya as my best friend, and I still had feelings for Ruri. My feelings were completely messed up, and the one I hated the most was myself…</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I didn’t know what to do anymore, Marumaru helped me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason I got to know him was that I started playing games to pass the time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every day, as I immersed myself in the game to avoid thinking about anything else, I got better and better at playing, so I put up clips (short videos) of my games on social networking sites to try it out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But it didn’t get any popularity, and I was thinking, well, whatever, when suddenly I received a message from an account I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“KN-san, I saw your video! You are very good! Wanna play together?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was Marumaru who sent me this message.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru was a bit of a disappointing person who, like me, posted clips on social networking sites… but his gameplay was much better than mine, but he never got any popularity.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I declined the offer from Marumaru at first.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the time, I was kind of reluctant to play games with someone I didn’t even know, and I didn’t want to interact with someone who may be abusive…</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I politely declined Marumaru’s invitation, but to my surprise, he sent me another message the day after I declined.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I really want to hang out with you, KN-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Naturally, I turned that down, too…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s play, KN-san!” “It would be fun to play with KN-san!” “KN-san and Marumaru make a good team, don’t you think?” “KN-san! It will be good if you play with me!” “KN-san! KN-san! KN-san! KN-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I kept refusing, but he kept asking me over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This guy was too persistent!</p>
<p class="calibre3">So finally I was convinced by Marumaru and decided to play a game with him just once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Playing games with someone else was much more fun than playing alone, and for that one time, I naturally forgot about Touya and Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since then, I have been playing games with Marumaru frequently.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But today’s Kinu is still in good condition. Did something good happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why does this guy have such good instincts? Even though I’ve only known him for almost a year, he knows me so well that it was sickening.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe this kind of thing was the reason we have been able to play together for so long.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Marumaru, actually…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I told him about my high school homeroom teacher &mdash; Kiritani-sensei &mdash; who visited me yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In high school, Kiritani-san was a shut-in, just like I was now, but a girl in his class changed him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was really trying to help me by telling me about those experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I told Marumaru everything that happened yesterday, including those things, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You have a good teacher!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru said happily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And based on the way you are phrasing it, you also think he is a good teacher~”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru said in a tone of voice as he knew everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was annoying like always…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The day is near when Kinu will go to school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…You.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said that remaining as a shut-in wasn’t necessarily a bad thing in itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whether or not I would attend school was totally up in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“School is nice~, it’s fun~!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s fun… How old are you to begin with? Are you in school right now?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t know anything about MARUMARU, or rather, every time I asked him, he evaded my questions. I trusted him and told him that I was a high school student, but I still tried to hide the specifics from him as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How old I am?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, couldn’t you at least tell me that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked, and Marumaru pondered, then said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s a secret☆”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He said it so mischievously. …This guy was still endlessly annoying.</p>


<p class="calibre3">[EDN: Sorry for the month-long delay, Char has been done with this for a while now but I was busy graduating and working on other projects. Don’t expect constant updates just yet, but hopefully will be shorter than another month.]</p>
<p class="calibre3">[TLN: Like is tough, need job.]</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">One afternoon on my day off. I &mdash; Aima Ruri &mdash; came to an amusement park to have fun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was not by myself, but with Touya, who I have been dating for about a year now. In short, it was a date.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The roller coaster was pretty fast, and it was fun and scary in a good way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Amidst the crowd of people coming and going, Touya, who was walking next to me, spoke to me happily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, it was.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But for some reason, he was staring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-What?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, um… sorry. Looks like Ruri didn’t have much fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh… T-That’s not true. I had a good time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I said this, Touya shook his head from side to side.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can tell when Ruri is not enjoying herself. We’ve been together since we were little.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He sounded sad, but I couldn’t deny it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because what he said was true.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I did not enjoy the roller coaster ride, or rather, I was not enjoying our date.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, it happens sometimes, doesn’t it? Anyway, let’s try freefalling this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yeah, sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I nodded at his suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he turned around and held out his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There are a lot of people here and it’s dangerous. Here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya smiled kindly. In a situation like this, lovers would hold hands as a matter of course. But I…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… that’s alright. I’m not a child.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see. Right…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya-kun turned his face down as if he was disheartened. Seeing him like that made my heart ache.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He had tried to hold my hand many times, tried to hug me, and made many other approaches, but I had avoided all of them like I was doing now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though we have been together for almost a year, our relationship has not progressed in any way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It has stopped since we started dating… no, it has stopped since Kinu stopped coming to middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…No matter how I thought about it, this was not good.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Touya. I knew that I&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s get in line over there, it’s gonna get crowded if we don’t hurry!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He said to me as if he was interrupting my words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He then headed off to the free-fall line by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was as if he was running away from me…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I replied with a whimper and followed after Touya-kun.<br class="text-left" />
It wouldn’t be good if things continued as they were. I know that, but Touya has been my friend since elementary school, and for whatever reason, I accepted his confession.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So even though I was thinking of breaking up with him, I couldn’t say it strongly enough.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even when I tried to be brave enough to tell him, he ran away from me, just like now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This has been going on for about six months now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I am the worst.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if I thought so, I would not be able to tell Touya-kun today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hated myself for acting like this so much.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Kiritani-sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a weekday evening. School had already ended.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My parents were away for work, and for some reason I was in my room playing games with Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, aren’t you way too good!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said to Kiritani-sensei who was sitting on my bed while playing the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The game was “Zomabrawl,” a well-known fighting game. It was a simple yet profound game in which the winner was the one who can knock the enemy off the field.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I was playing against Kiritani-sensei, and to my disbelief, I had lost ten games in a row.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was one of my favorite games other than battle royale games… As a stay-at-home gamer, I was shocked at this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I’ve been playing this game for a bit.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, that’s definitely more than a little bit!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had lost all ten of my matches to Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, is Kiritani-sensei just going to play games again today?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since his first visit, Kiritani-sensei has always come to my house whenever his work schedule allows it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…As he told me the first time, he never really forced me to go to school with him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the contrary, he came over to my house and we played games together and talked about the latest youtube video recommendations.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, for today, I guess I’ll leave it at that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s what you always say.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I pointed this out, Kiritani-sensei gave a wry laugh. Others might wonder what he was doing even though he was a teacher… but I had an idea of what he was trying to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s already this late. Maybe I should go home soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei checked the time on his phone and stood up, bag in hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, we both went to the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll see if I can come back in two days this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I see. Got it…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I just said, Kiritani-sensei would probably come to my house again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When we talk, I could tell that he chose his words carefully so as not to hurt me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think he was really trying to help me, unlike the teachers I’ve had in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If that was the case&mdash;shouldn’t I respond to his actions?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought to myself as I watched Kiritani-sensei’s back as he put his hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, wait a minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I stopped Kiritani-sensei who was about to go outside.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He looked back at me with a puzzled expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I began to tell him the story he probably wanted to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I haven’t actually been to school since middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! Why so sudden?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s not sudden. Sensei must have been waiting for me. So I have to tell you why I stopped going to school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">We always played games and talked without a care in the world, but Kiritani-sensei never pried into my affairs. I never talked about myself either.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I knew.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was probably waiting for me to tell him about myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right. I have been to your house so many times, so you probably figured it out.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, it was obvious.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But he was a good teacher as he didn’t forcefully ask me about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was because of his actions that I decided to tell my story now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, I want to talk to you about how I got this way…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, let’s hear it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei took off his shoes and went up the doorway again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then we went to the living room so that we could talk.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After we both moved to the living room, I told him about the reason why I had stopped going to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That I had confessed my love to my childhood friend, Ruri, and that my best friend, Touya, liked her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because of this, I was bullied by my classmates, especially by Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The fact was that Touya has always hated me. That Ruri might have used me to be with Touya since we were little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I revealed everything that happened when I was in the third year of middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After listening to my story, Kiritani-sensei muttered nothing more than that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason he didn’t say anything like, “I’m sorry you had a hard time,” or “must have been rough,” was probably because the reason I stopped going to school was my own fault.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I confessed my feelings to my best friend’s crush.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know it was my fault too.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Still, I was shocked that Touya, who had been with me all along, never liked me, and that Ruri might have taken advantage of me as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So to be honest, selfishly, I still have some feelings of hatred for the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I still want to be best friends with Touya again, and my feelings for Ruri haven’t disappeared at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hated myself because of that…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t know what to do anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered in a quiet voice that sounded like it was about to disappear right after I spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Unlike in middle school, this time, words came right back to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think there is any life without mistakes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei continued in a calm tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, if you have lived your whole life without making a single mistake, that means you have never had a single quarrel with anyone, and you have never told even the smallest lie. Do you think there is such a person?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…There isn’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I replied, Kiritani-sensei smiled warmly, “Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think that everyone that lives makes mistakes from time to time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, that was why I confessed my love to Touya’s crush.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That I have hated both Touya and Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still want to be best friends with Touya, and I still have feelings for Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All of this may be wrong, but I don’t want you to hate yourself for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the end of our conversation, Kiritani-sensei told me this in a gentle tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no way I could not hate myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought so even after listening to Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei, seeing me like that, suddenly started talking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“When I first talked to Kenji-kun, I told you that we would work together to find what it means to be yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Indeed, that was what Kiritani-sensei said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this moment, it is important to be able to do what you want to do and live your life the way you want to live it… But when I replied that I didn’t really know what it meant to be myself, he said he would work with me to find it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think to be yourself, you have to like yourself first.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To like myself…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, that’s right. If you don’t like yourself, I don’t think you can be yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think what Kiritani-sensei said was right.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was already having a hard time hating myself. It was painful.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But ever since that incident, no matter what I do or how much fun I have, I always feel guilty about Touya and Ruri somewhere in my heart, and I can’t even laugh from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How am I supposed to like myself like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I found myself pathetically asking for help.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Right after I said it, I thought to myself that I really was a helpless guy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Kiritani-sensei didn’t dismiss me with disappointment or abandon me; he gave serious consideration to what I was going through, and he said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maybe you should just accept the mistake you had made.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Accept it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was a little puzzled, not understanding the meaning of Kiritani-sensei’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps sensing this, he explained carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Acceptance means that you admit to yourself that you’ve done something wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I confessed to the person whom Touya likes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hated both Touya and Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still want to be best friends with Touya again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still love Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have to admit to myself that I was full of mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, who has made mistakes, is still Kenji-kun. So you have to reflect on that, but there is no need to deny your mistakes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No need to deny it…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I understood what Kiritani-sensei was trying to convey.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I’m sorry to Sensei, but I…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think this will speak louder than my words.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was at a loss of what to say, Kiritani-san took something out of his business bag.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, he held it out to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…A movie ticket?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, it is. A ticket for a Hollywood movie.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A Hollywood movie?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why at a time like this? I wondered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If Kenji-kun sees this, you might be able to like yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“R-Really…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked, Kiritani-sensei nodded his head. He had a confident look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I replied and accepted the ticket.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, but Kenji, I don’t know if you can go to the movies by yourself right now. Do you want to go with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I can go to the movies by myself. Even though I say I’m a shut-in, it doesn’t mean I can’t go outside at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. Then your level of withdrawal was about the same as mine in high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That doesn’t make me happy…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, we’re both at the same level of withdrawal, but I’m a much better gamer than you are.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is the worst thing you can say to a stay-at-home gamer! I’ll win next time, I promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said with enthusiasm, and Kiritani-sensei chuckled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve told you everything I wanted to tell you, so I’m going to go now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Umm…Thank you, sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m a teacher, so it’s only natural.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said it as if it was really a matter of course. He was an amazing person, I honestly thought so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He went to the front door, put on his shoes and placed his hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’d like to come back after Kenji-kun sees that movie, so I’ll visit again in a week or so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Got it. I’ll make sure I watch the movie by then.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei nodded at my words, then opened the door and left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What a kind teacher…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that from the bottom of my heart, including from the first time I met him until today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei was by far the best teacher I have ever met.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…But what’s this movie about?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked at the movie ticket.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said that if I saw this movie, I might be able to like myself. But even after looking at the title and description, it looked like a normal movie, but I wonder what kind of movie it was…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Please.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered and gripped the ticket a little tighter in anticipation.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“The aquarium was a lot of fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A weekend. Today I had a date with Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As he said, we went to the aquarium today and were now on our way home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The dolphin show, with those cute dolphins flying so high, got me a little excited even though I’m in high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, the dolphins were amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The dolphins were so high up in the air that they were flying over the water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But maybe I was not laughing with him right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Where should we go on our next date?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Isn’t there… soccer practice? Shouldn’t first-years go?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s… okay. The third-year students’ last tournament is coming up, and it seems like having the freshmen there would be a distraction.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since Touya-kun and I go to different high schools, I don’t know what was going on with his soccer team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I could only believe his words… but I wonder if he was really okay with going out with me all the time on his days off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, I received a notification on my phone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked and saw that I had received a LINE from a new friend I made in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The message said that she wanted to go somewhere together sometime.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To which I replied, “Sure!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, who are you talking to?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya asked unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s a new girl friend of mine from high school. She wants to hang out with me sometime.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hmm, what kind of friend?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What kind of friend… it’s a normal female friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see..”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Touya-kun said this, he moved from next to me to in front of me and stopped dead in his tracks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-What’s wrong…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re not talking with Kinu, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was a little afraid of the look on his face when he asked me that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I’m not! She really is a friend!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, let me see your phone.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so surprised by his words that for a moment I couldn’t say anything back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t believe that this was something that Touya-kun had said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ever since elementary school, he had been a considerate person. Even when he was playing soccer, he never got angry when a teammate made a mistake, and would even say that they would take it back instead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And yet…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why not? If you have nothing to hide, you can show it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, but… this is absurd.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here I could have just done as Touya-kun said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I didn’t want to. I feel that my relationship with Touya-kun would end in many ways. Not just as lovers, but as friends.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Then why don’t you always look happy when you’re with me!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Touya-kun shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But soon he huffed and turned his face down a little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, Ruri…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, umm… I’m sorry too.””</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sometimes Touya-kun told me I didn’t look like I was having fun, but I knew.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That I have never once had a date with him that I truly enjoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey… Ruri, turn around for a second.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I turned my head toward Touya-kun as he called me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, suddenly, he put his finger on my chin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he slowly moved his face closer to mine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately, I pushed him away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, I quickly moved away from him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Touya, why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We’ve been dating for about a year now, and I thought it would have been fine…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Even so… You’re acting weird today, Touya.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know… I’m really sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya-kun apologized with his eyes facing the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It wasn’t supposed to be like this…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He continued, muttering to himself. I felt the same way. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. How did we end up like this?</p>
<p class="calibre3">If it were true, the three of us would still be having a good time together, just as we did in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I think about this, I thought back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no point in continuing this kind of relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya, we&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As usual, he interrupted my words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I did not give up and tried to tell him one more time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Listen to me! I can’t be with you anymore, Touya-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t do this!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He denied it more strongly than the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because I only have Ruri now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He said with a sad smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing the look on his face as if he was about to disappear, I couldn’t say anything more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It must be too late for everything. For Touya-kun…and Kinu as well…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Next time, let’s go to a movie for the first time in a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya-kun asked me out on our next date with the same smile as before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">To which I could only nod.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Where did I and Touya-kun go wrong?</p>
