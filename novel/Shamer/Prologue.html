<h1 class="calibre1">Prologue &#8211; What If You Could Live a Life Without Mistakes?</h1>

<p class="calibre3">I’ve thought about it and wondered what would happen if I could live such a life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Would it be the ideal life, since everything would work out as it should?</p>
<p class="calibre3">But to be honest, there was no one who could live a life without a single mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because there is no one that has never told even a small lie or had a fight with a friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just by living a normal life, humans make mistakes, not just once, but many times.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I have made a mistake too.</p>

<p class="calibre3">It was a very big mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I was depressed, withdrawn, and selfishly jealous of those around me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But in the end, I was so disgusted with myself for having made that mistake…</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that time, I was in pain no matter what I did.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I knew that there was no way out of this pain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was the punishment of those who have made a mistake.</p>

<p class="calibre3">But then, “that person” taught me something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if I made a mistake, there was still something important&mdash;</p>
