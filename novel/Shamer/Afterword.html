<h1 class="calibre1">Afterword</h1><div class="text-left">
				<p class="calibre3">Nice to meet you. If you’ve been reading my work for a while, it’s been a while. I’m Mitsuki Midori.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I am very honored to be the author of “Shamer,” the second light novel derived from Chinozo-sama’s songs, following “Goodbye Declaration”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This work can be enjoyed by those who have read “Goodbye Declaration” as well as those who have not, and I hope that many people will read it as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The story of “Shamer” is about the main character Tanaka Kenji, who has made a mistake and is gradually recovering from it through various experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Have you ever made a mistake in your life?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I know I’m asking this, but I think everyone has made mistakes, to a greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, I have too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When we make mistakes, we sometimes blame others even though we know it is our fault, or on the contrary, we sometimes feel self-loathing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I personally hope that this work will be read by such people and help them recover, even if only a little.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I would like to conclude with a few words of acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Chinozo-sama. Thank you very much for your advice on this piece, even more so than on “Goodbye Declaration”! Without your advice, “Shamer” would not have been completed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thank you again, Arsetica-sama. Thank you again for your wonderful illustrations, which are too cute! To put it mildly, they are the best!</p>
<p class="calibre3">M-sama, the editor in charge. Thank you very much for your various suggestions during the writing process.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thanks to M-sama’s help, the quality of this work has improved many times over.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone who was involved in the publication and, above all, to the readers who picked up this work. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I sincerely hope that we will have the opportunity to meet again somewhere&mdash;</p>


<p class="calibre3">[TLN: Shamer done, Elite is next, but I got exams so yeah, after that.]</p>
<p class="calibre3">[EDN: And with that, Shamer is done. Once again, thanks to Char for TLing and I hope you guys didn’t mind the parts (editing 70 google doc pages for a single chapter post was just too much).]</p>
