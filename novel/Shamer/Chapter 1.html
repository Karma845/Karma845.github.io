				<p class="calibre3">It was late May. It was the time of year when the temperature was gradually rising and summer was approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I &mdash; Tanaka Kenji &mdash; was in the middle of the soccer team’s last middle school tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Takanashi! Over here!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I called out to my teammate who was about to be surrounded by players from the opposing team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He noticed and immediately kicked the ball this way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Okay! Nice pass!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ball landed perfectly at my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to go on the offensive from here, but the next thing I knew, the enemy team had me surrounded in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This guy is not very physical or good at dribbling! Rush him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the players who had surrounded me gave me an order.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What a terrible thing to say. Well, he was right…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Not good…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The score was tied at 1-1. The game had already gone into overtime, and we were in the second half of the game. With roughly two minutes left, if time was used out here, the game would go into a penalty shootout…</p>
<p class="calibre3">We were not very good at penalty kicks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, we must score a goal here…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go for it~!! Kinu~!!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, I heard the girls cheering. “Kinu” is my nickname.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her voice was strangely clear in my ears, even though the surroundings should have been noisy with the instructions of the players and the sound of their footsteps running on the soccer field. …I’ll do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu! Over here!””</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked in the direction of the voice and saw our team’s captain, ace striker, and my best friend&mdash;Itsuki Touya&mdash;raising his hand and calling out to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We can’t let the forwards get the ball out of our hands! We’ve got to get in front of them!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The player who had just taunted me gave another order again, and the players surrounding me all rushed to steal the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was underestimated and Touya was on the lookout. I’ve seen this scene many times, and it was always the same.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After calling out his name, I, who was surrounded, kicked the ball straight out to the player who had put out his foot to take the ball directly in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The opponent looked puzzled for a moment, but the ball passed under his legs and went to Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nice Kinu!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m counting on you, Ace!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya received the ball and dribbled down the field at great speed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t let him go free! Stop him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The player in front of me gave a panicked order.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately after, the players of the enemy team stood in front of Touya, who was relentlessly advancing forward.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were three of them. Normally, I would have passed the ball…but not for Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first one he passed with simple speed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No way!?” “Damn!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The second and third players were passed in a blink of an eye with the use of skillful feints.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As expected of our ace, who had the best control of the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Keeper! Stop him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">With all of the opponent’s defenders out of the way, the only player left in front of Touya was the keeper.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The keeper was bold enough to step forward to block the path of Touya’s shot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was probably not a bad decision.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, Touya, seeing the opponent’s movement, gently kicked the ball out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ball floated up and over the keeper’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It drew a beautiful arc and went straight into the goal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya’s voice was subdued and raised his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought he should be happier, but he was always like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As expected of Touya! Nice shot!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Our ace is the best!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Our teammates praised him for scoring the winning goal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was less than a minute left. If we don’t let up, we would probably win.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nice pass! Kinu!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya was making a sign toward me. While none of my teammates were talking about me, he was the only one who praised me like that. This was always the case.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That was a nice shot by Touya, too! That’s our ace!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said, and he responded by raising his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We defended the remaining minute without any danger and won the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this, we advanced to the finals of the Tokyo tournament. We were just one win away from our long-awaited national tournament.</p>

				<p class="calibre3">“Nice game! Well done!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After the game, as Touya and I were walking down a residential street to go home, it was not the soccer team coach who clapped his hands and praised us&mdash;but a beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why are you acting so superior?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because this year, when I cheered for you, you always won! In other words, the soccer team won because of me!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The beautiful girl replied proudly in a good mood.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her name was Aima Ruri. She was the one who was cheering for us at the game earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She had round eyes and well-groomed, shiny hair that reached to her back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her face was rather cute, and she seemed to be popular with all kinds of boys.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri and I have known each other since we were little &mdash; since we could remember, so to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We have always done everything together. I have been playing soccer since elementary school, and Ruri has always come to my games to cheer me on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But we never lose a game when Ruri is there, so I think she is our goddess of victory.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said in a fresh voice. But as Ruri herself said, it’s only this year… Last year and two years ago, when Ruri came, we usually lost. Was it possible to have a goddess of victory for this year only?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As expected of you, Touya-kun! You know me well~!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After such an exchange, Touya and Ruri laughed at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Touya was in the fifth grade, he transferred to the elementary school where I and Ruri live. Since then, we gradually became good friends, partly because our houses were in the same neighborhood, and now, it was a matter of course that the three of us were together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But you know, joking aside, both of you were really great! Touya had a nice dribble and a nice shot, and Kinu’s passing was great too!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya’s dribbling and shooting was really impressive!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I agreed with Ruri. I started playing soccer in elementary school, while Touya started in middle school, but he originally had a great sense of athleticism, so he improved very quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was now the dependable captain and absolute ace of the soccer team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Rumor has it that he has received offers of recommendation from several strong high schools.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t know if Touya was concerned about me, but he doesn’t talk about it at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu’s passing was more impressive! You were watching the opponent’s moves!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m not that good. I didn’t overtake three players or shoot over their heads.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, that guy kept taunting me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was probably why I was able to make the pass through the legs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What are you talking about? That’s not true.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s not the case!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri came close to me and insisted in a loud voice. Why so loud!?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it all of the sudden… My eardrums almost broke.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because! Kinu said things that I don’t understand! You were working hard today!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, maybe I was trying hard, but&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Compared to Touya, I really didn’t do anything. When I was about to say that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know that Kinu runs more than anyone else and works hard in attack and defense.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Working hard… is something everyone does, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No. Maybe everyone else is doing their best, but Kinu is definitely the hardest worker on the team! I guarantee it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri placed her hand on her chest and said confidently. When was that tone of voice?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Besides! You also encourage those who make mistakes, praise those who play well, and do your very best in those areas!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! O-Oh, I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was true that I considered the atmosphere of the team and paid attention to details…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri really looks out for others.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes! As Kinu’s childhood friend, I’ll be watching you all the time!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri smiled cutely.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The smile she suddenly showed me made my heart jump in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t mean it that way…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu has a really good childhood friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Following Ruri, Touya also said something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What are you talking about? If we were childhood friends, then so is Touya.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…yeah, well, right. I forgot about that one.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya laughed inadvertently as he put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He’s been with me for years, but he’s such a terrible person to forget that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But as Ruri said, it was Kinu’s passing that allowed me to dribble freely, score a goal, and win the game today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“R-Really? I think that’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s not true. Kinu’s passes always reach me when I want them. Thanks for everything!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! …T-That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I got embarrassed and looked away at what Touya said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What a man. Is he trying to make me fall in love with him?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Kinu! I have a feeling you’re happier than when I praised you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? Of course, I’d be happy if Touya praised me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s that~! You should be happier when I praised you!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No good. You always get carried away. You’re always asking me to buy you something next time!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let me get carried away~! Buy me something~!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As the two of us were talking to each other, Touya started to giggle.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You two really get along well.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I mean, we’ve known each other for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We’ve been together since we were very young.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was just as Ruri said. I had the feeling that she was already by my side when I realized it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe they felt the same.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Not fair.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but his voice was too quiet for me to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, when I tried to ask Touya about what he said&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh no! It’s already so late!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Ruri looked at her phone and shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s wrong? Are you playing games again?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good answer! I actually promised to play a game with my online friends after this!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You…what would you have done if we had lost the game today?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I would postpone the appointment and comfort you both! Especially Kinu, I would use a pacifier and a rattle to make him wobble&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You would comfort me like a baby!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was now really glad we didn’t lose today’s game. My childhood friend was about to create black history for me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Congrats on today! I’ll definitely be there to cheer you on in your next match! Bye-bye!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri waved her hands in the air and then left the place like a ninja.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How much do you want to play games?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri really likes games.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess so. She is the one who had to decide between the soccer team manager and the after-school gaming and ended up picking the game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So I guess that means we’re less than a game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…That’s for sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri’s love of video games was exceptional, unlike most video game enthusiasts. Ever since she was a little girl, she used to make me play games with her. The worst days were the ones when she made me play all day long.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…However, for that, Ruri also spent all day with me doing what I wanted to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was just starting to play soccer, if I was practicing on my own to get better, she came to help me every time, whether it was a weekday or a holiday.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri even gave me the nickname “Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, even though it was a nickname, only Ruri and Touya called me by it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was in elementary school, before Touya came to my new school. My classmates made fun of me for having a normal name, and I had a complex about my name since.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, my game name was “KN,” so they started calling me by my nickname “Kinu,” which she just took from there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was always free, but always acted with someone else’s best interest in mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was a good friend to me&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya called my name.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hmm? What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Do you want to go to a nearby park and talk for a while?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“At the park? Can’t we just talk on the way home?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked, he shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it’s very important.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya has a serious expression on his face. He was not usually a jabbering dummy, but it was a little unusual to see him with this kind of expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I nodded my head, wondering what the heck he was going to talk about.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">Touya and I moved to a nearby park together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This park was where Ruri and I used to play when we were little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even after Ruri fell in love with games, her mother had instructed her to go outside to play.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though she was an indoor person, Ruri was very athletic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And it was also a park where the three of us used to play together after Touya transferred to our school. Inside the park, several small children were happily playing on the playground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The three of us used to play together in this park.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, I used to play soccer with Ruri in the neighborhood. When we were playing soccer, Ruri kicked the ball into the window of a neighbor’s house and got in a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hahaha, that happened to us too.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya laughed briskly. …But this was not the time for such old stories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…So, what did you want to talk about?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ahh, that’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said after I reminded him</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then his face turned into a nervous one and said &mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, is there anyone you like?”</p>

<p class="calibre3">I blew up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What!? W-What are you talking about out of the blue!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because we are in the throes of puberty. I thought maybe there’s someone or two you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Even if I did, this is so sudden…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">What was so important about this…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, Kinu, is there someone you like?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya asked me again. His eyes looked straight at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why so serious? I wondered, but my best friend was so serious. I thought I should answer seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…There is none.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said back, and Touya asked me in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m serious. All I like is soccer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see. Okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I answered properly once again, Touya mumbled something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But that was a lie. The truth was I have someone I like.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A girl I grew up with who was always there for me at all times.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I like Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But if I told her how I feel, it might change the relationship between the three of us. For example, Touya might become reserved and stop being with us…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I like Ruri, but I also liked the time the three of us spent together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thought about that, I couldn’t very well say what was really going on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I, you know, have someone I like.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ehh!? Seriously?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though I was struggling to think of the right answer, Touya made a shocking disclosure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We had been together since elementary school, and I had never heard that he had someone he liked.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But why did you ask me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, that’s just because I’m curious about who my best friend likes, but it’s not a good idea to force you to answer…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s with all the concern? You sound like a girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know, I’ve been thinking about you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the middle of his words, Touya pointed a finger at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-What is this…?”</p>
<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008.jpeg" alt="" width="1354" height="1923" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3659" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008.jpeg 1354w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00008-1082x1536.jpeg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1354px) 100vw, 1354px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I like Kinu.&#8221;</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya revealed it in a very casual manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was so natural that for a moment I was surprised! But then I…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come on? You could have believed me at least a little bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because, Touya, you just grabbed the thighs of your pants. That’s your habit when you lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I pointed my finger at him &mdash; just as I said, he was clutching his pants.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, no, I’ve done it again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya scratched his head as if the prank had failed. What do you mean, “Done it again”?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Goodness. You didn’t have to come all the way to the park just to play a prank. The sun is going down and it’s getting cold, so let’s get the heck out of here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I stood up from the bench, a little dismayed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wait, wait! It’s true that I have someone I like!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya started talking like that again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought it was just going to be a prank again anyway… He has got that kind of personality.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then tell me who you like, Touya.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was sure he’ll say my name again or give some other random answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was what I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Ruri.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">…What?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The person I like is Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-Wait a minute! It was a lie again. You’re trying to surprise me again, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m not lying. I really like Ruri. I’ve always liked Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya made his feelings clear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I immediately turned my attention to his hands, but he did not grab his pants. In other words, everything he was saying now was true.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No way… I couldn’t believe that Touya liked Ruri…</p>
<p class="calibre3">And he meant for a long time, since elementary school?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t know that at all, and I didn’t even realize it…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So here is the thing…Kinu, will you help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the midst of being completely flustered, Touya asked me to help him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Eh, help you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I mean it as it is. I’ve been with the three of you, but I’d like you to give me and Ruri a little time alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Time alone with Ruri…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. You’ll cooperate with me, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya held out his hand to me with expectant eyes. He doesn’t seem to think in the slightest that I would refuse. But I like Ruri, too…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We’re best friends, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya asked me with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was a hint of pressure in his smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…T-That was right. Touya was my precious best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We have played soccer together since elementary school, and even if my opponents made fun of me, only Touya always believed in my passes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">T-That was why… I&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Of course I’ll help you. We’re best friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the end, I promised to cooperate with him and held his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I like Ruri… but that doesn’t make me selfish enough to put my own feelings first and refuse my best friend’s request.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, if I were to reveal my feelings here, it would destroy the relationship between the three of us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I were to do that, I felt it would be much better for me to hold back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you! I knew you would say so!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya laughed, looking truly happy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first time I saw him like that, I realized that there was nothing I could do to take it back and I felt a terrible pain in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! I’ll do my best to help you, so hang in there!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I shouted to cover up the pain in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My best friend was in love with someone else, and it was my childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I needed to help him as well…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought and at the same time, the pain in my heart was getting worse and worse.</p>

<p><br></p>

				<p class="calibre3">The day after Touya revealed his feelings to me. Me, Touya, and Ruri went to school together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We usually go to school together, or rather, we have always gone to school together since elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that Touya was going to ask me to leave them so they could go to school alone, but he told me that if I did that, she would definitely notice..</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I heard that, I felt a bit of relief, even though I was pathetic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! Here comes yesterday’s hero!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As we entered the classroom together since all three of us were in the same class, Takanashi, a classmate and a member of the same soccer team, pointed his finger at us and started to talk. He pointed to Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, what? Me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We were just talking about yesterday’s game. That was an amazing dribble and shot from Touya. He seriously looked like an ace!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">For some reason, Takanashi sounded proud.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re so cool, Touya~!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As expected of Touya!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya is really amazing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other classmates instantly surrounded Touya while praising him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thanks to this, I and Ruri, who were by his side, were pushed out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I just played my role as a forward, and I couldn’t dribble or shoot if my teammates hadn’t got the ball to me in the first place…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why are you being so modest? We won yesterday thanks to Touya, so you should be more proud of yourself!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As Takanashi patted Touya on the back, his classmates also said stuff like, “Touya’s so cool!” “Touya is the best!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day after the soccer team’s games were usually like this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whenever the team won a game, it was always because Touya scored a goal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And he was a person with an outstanding sense of sportsmanship, grades that always rank in the top one digit of the grade, a handsome and bright face, and a gentlemanly personality.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So it was not at all unusual for me to have a situation like today where they have “Touya Fever.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Naturally, I was no match for him in soccer or academics.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I respected him and admired him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey you all! Yesterday’s game had heroes other than Touya!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, a lively voice echoed through the classroom. It was Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? Where is he?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He’s right here! Here!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi asked with a dubious look in his eyes, and Ruri raised my arm to the sky like a referee raising the boxer’s winner. What was she doing!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji was yesterday’s hero…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s right! If it wasn’t for Kinu’s pass, Touya-kun wouldn’t have scored that goal! In other words, Kinu staged yesterday’s victory! He’s a fantasista!” (EDN: According to google, Fantasista is a old soccer/football manga)</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri appealed desperately.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Fantasista” was an exaggeration, and she definitely didn’t understand the meaning of the word.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s started again. Aima’s fondness for her childhood friend”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi said in exasperation at Ruri’s comment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other classmates also looked at each other with the same look of “Oh, no, not again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s with that reaction! I’m just telling the truth! If it weren’t for Kinu’s pass…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, yes, I’m tired of hearing you brag about your childhood friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As Ruri was in the middle of her complaint, Takanashi stopped her with his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s true that Kenji is an okay passer, I’ll give him that. …But other than that, he is subtle, and compared to the great Touya, he is nothing at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi’s words were met with nods of agreement from his classmates. Yesterday I was told terrible things by my enemies, and today I’m being told the same by my allies, too. Can I cry about this?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it’s not! Kinu is much more amazing and a super player than you think, Takanashi-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I get it, I get it. I’ll let it be that way. Can we just drop the topic now, please~?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps not wanting to be prodded further by Ruri, Takanashi forcefully ended the conversation and urged the surrounding classmates to disperse.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The classmates may have thought the same thing and quickly dispersed from the area.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mou… They don’t understand Kinu at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t do anything rash. My heart can’t take it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I want everyone to know that Kinu is amazing! Also, umm… when I do this… does it bother you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri turned her face down a little and asked anxiously.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day after a soccer game, Ruri will always tell our classmates that I was great too when there was Touya fever going on. Whenever Touya scores a goal, it was usually when I passed the ball to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, Ruri’s behavior may be a little too much… but I’m…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t mind. Rather… umm, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye, but I thanked her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, Ruri’s expression suddenly changed to a bright one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah! From now on! I’m going to show off Kinu to everyone!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I honestly don’t want more of that…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was smiling happily even though she was saying so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wonder what she will do next time. …It was making me nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, Kinu. I should have said something more.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it’s not Touya’s fault. I mean, they’re right, and it’s nobody’s fault.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I responded to Touya’s apology.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was just a good passer there. Nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But then again, Ruri really likes Kinu!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! I-I don’t like you or anything! I just want to show you off because we’ve been together since childhood! If Kinu is great, that means I’m great!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re actually covering for me for your own good!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was surprised, and Ruri laughed like a villain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What a farce this was. …Well, I guess it was true that she didn’t like me romantically.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right. Everyone, take your seats!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The classroom door opened and the homeroom teacher entered. At the same time, all my classmates returned to their seats. We were about to go to our seats as well when it happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m looking forward to working with you about yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Touya whispered in my ear so that Ruri could not hear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I turned around, he was smiling again, just like yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m counting on you, my best friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">With that, Touya walked to his seat with a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…What was I doing talking happily with Ruri?</p>
<p class="calibre3">From today on I have to support Touya’s love and make sure he and Ruri get together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked over and saw Ruri sitting in her seat, lightly chatting with her friends while her homeroom teacher was preparing for homeroom. That sounds like fun…</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered if I would be able to enjoy talking with Ruri like that again if she and Touya got together.</p>

<p class="calibre3">After school. Normally, we should be practicing for the finals of the Tokyo tournament, but our soccer team always has a cool-down day the day after a game, and club activities are canceled. Voluntary practice is also forbidden.</p>
<p class="calibre3">According to the coach, this is because middle school students are not yet physically fit, and if they push themselves too hard, they will soon get injured. Rest is part of practice, the coach always says.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I was at the arcade with Ruri and Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri invited me to go with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, I have been playing only with Ruri and Touya since I was little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason was that I’ve always given priority to Ruri and Touya, even when I’ve been invited by other people.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was how much I care about them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thought about it, I didn’t know anyone I was close to except the two of them…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yay! I win again!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In front of the fighting game, Ruri happily shows off a guts pose.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re too strong…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile, I, sitting opposite her, was limping.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as we entered the arcade, Ruri asked me to play against her, and before I could say no, she had me sit down in front of a fighting game. I was forced to play against her for 10 rounds, but I lost all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As you would expect from someone who plays games after school every day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was being hit with a lot of unintelligible frame-ups, and an amateur like me couldn’t compete with her at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’m doing it again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had to support Touya’s love life, but it wasn’t going well at all because of Ruri’s behavior. I’ve been trying to get Ruri and Touya alone at school, but she always tries to get the three of us to go out together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe Ruri valued our time together as much as I do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Or maybe I’m simply not ready for it yet…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, can you do me a favor?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! What, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was unexpectedly approached by Touya, I jumped, wondering if he had seen through my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I wanted to play the crane game alone with Ruri from now on, can you find a good reason and go home?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go home… but since it’s Ruri, she might say she’s going home with me then.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’ll be fine. I’m going to hold her back a little bit. Please, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya put his hands together, then bowed his head and asked earnestly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When my best friend did this to me, I wouldn’t be able to refuse…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you! Kinu is my best friend after all!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya thanked me with a happy look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was supposed to be a joyous occasion, but my heart didn’t beat at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sorry! My mom asked me to do some shopping, so I’m going home first!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said in a slightly louder voice so that Ruri could hear me over the din of the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really? Well, I should go home too&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, Ruri should stay at the arcade. Touya is here too!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I insisted, and Touya moved closer to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right. I’m sorry Kinu, but we are going to play some more.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri looked at me, but as if to intercept her, Touya took her hand and led her away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You worry too much. I’m going home first, so have a good time. See you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I turned my back to them and started to walk away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So it was just Touya and Ruri together… It was like a pseudo date already.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this in mind, I came to the doorway of the arcade.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But then I couldn’t help but notice the two and turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, that’s great! You’re so good at the crane game!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, I am! I’m always up for a game!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Both of them were smiling happily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Especially Touya had a look of enjoyment on his face that he had never shown when he was with me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I see… Touya really likes Ruri. Even though I heard it from him yesterday, my heart tightened again when I actually saw him like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, Touya and Ruri happily played the crane game together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They seemed to be a good match. …That was a given.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya was the ace and captain of the soccer team, and he was a smart, high-spec handsome boy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was said to be one of the prettiest girls in our grade, and there were many boys like me and Touya who had feelings for her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If they were to become lovers, I was sure everyone would congratulate them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of course I’m not good enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was just a childhood friend who has been with her for a long time, and I was not even close to Touya in terms of studies and sports.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no way Ruri would ever look at me like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If that was the case, then I must be right in helping my best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I told myself as I left the arcade by myself.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Day after day, I supported Touya so that he could be alone with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have heard from Touya himself that when he was alone with Ruri, he aggressively showed himself off and asked her out on dates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, Ruri was puzzled by his sudden change in attitude and has yet to go on a date with him. Even so, Touya tried his best to make Ruri like him on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Watching my best friend’s desperate attempts, I, who at first had mixed feelings, gradually began to think about one thing.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“I’m home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">One day after school. I came home from soccer practice and was changing my shoes at the door when my mother came out. My family was not that wealthy and my parents both work, so it was not unusual for me to come home after practice and find no one home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But it looked like Mom finished work early today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Welcome home. Kenji has a visitor.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A visitor?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Who could it be? I wondered, and moved to the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I saw a dandy man in his forties sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Matsunaga-san!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The gentleman called my name in a mature voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His name was Matsunaga-san and he was the coach of “Teijo High School,” one of the most prestigious soccer schools in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the reason why the coach of such a prestigious school was at my house was because I have received a recommendation from Teijo High School.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My apologies. Thank you for coming all the way here today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, this is no big deal to come to your house.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san smiled calmly. Rumor has it that he was a rather strict coach.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I’ve had him visit me several times now, and I’ve never seen anything like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But even so, Kenji-kun’s last pass in the last game was brilliant.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it was because Touya-kun was in a good position.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Even so, no ordinary player could have calmly slipped the ball past the opponent’s legs in a tense situation and accurately placed it at the feet of Touya-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san, who was at the game the other day, seemed to be enjoying himself a little and praised my play.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san appreciated my pass very much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About a year ago, I replaced a senior who was injured at the time, and I made three passes that led to a goal. My performance caught the eye of Mr. Matsunaga, who happened to be watching the game, and thankfully, I received a recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I was so happy to hear about the recommendation that I jumped… But, I&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So what do you think? Are you ready to come to my place?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“U-Um… I’m sorry. I’m still having a bit of a hard time…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Although Matsunaga-san offered me his recommendation, I was unable to make a decision.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are two types of recommendations for “Teijo High School.” One was a special recommendation that waives most of the tuition and other fees.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Those would be prepared for those who are expected to go immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other was a general recommendation that only guarantees admission to the high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The recommendation I received was for the latter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this case, I would have to pay all the high tuition fees of a private school, and since Teijo High School was located far from my home, I would have to live alone in a dormitory, which would also cost me money. In addition, the soccer teams of strong schools often go on expeditions, so they need money for that as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In other words, it was a considerable burden for those of us who were not particularly wealthy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Both of my parents told me not to worry about it, but as a child, I couldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… if I make it to the nationals, you’ll put me up for a special recommendation to Teijo High School, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah. I can’t guarantee you a special recommendation, but I’ll talk to my superiors.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san nodded his head in agreement to my words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have a deal with Matsunaga-san that if our soccer team makes it to the national tournament, he would recommend me for one of the special recommendation slots.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fortunately, the special recommendation slots don’t seem to be filled yet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m hoping you’ll decide to enter our high school as soon as possible. Otherwise, the recommendation slots will fill up fast.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm, I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I’m the one who inadvertently expressed my true feelings because you are a promising athlete. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I apologized, and Matsunaga-san apologized back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“More importantly, good luck in the upcoming matches. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Y-Yes!</p>
<p class="calibre3">I replied energetically.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was the only person other than Touya and Ruri who would say that they had high expectations for me.</p>

<p class="calibre3">After that, Matsunaga-san talked with my mother for a while and then left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were probably talking about recommendation-related matters.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After Matsunaga-san left, I finished eating dinner and was in my room.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sitting on a chair, I looked at the pamphlet of “Teijo High School” that Matsunaga-san had given me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were a regular participant in the metropolitan tournament and have participated in the national tournament more than ten times, winning the national championship twice among them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If I can get into this high school, I’m sure I can get closer to my dream…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have had a dream since I was a little kid: to be a professional soccer player.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was little, my father, who enjoyed watching soccer games, took me to the stadium.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The moment the game started, the stadium was filled with cheers from the crowd and I saw the players running on the field surrounded by fans and I wanted to be like them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was when I started practicing and playing soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though I knew I was not as talented as others, I practiced hard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was glad that what I had cultivated in that way was appreciated by the coach of a strong school, even if it was by accident.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was really glad that I have worked so hard at soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We definitely have to win the next game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Looking at the pamphlet, I made up my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If we win the next game, I might get into Teijo High School with a special recommendation. Then I could enter high school and pursue my dream with all my might without putting a burden on my parents.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If we don’t make it… then I’ll just have to thank my parents from the bottom of my heart and ask them to let me into “Teijo High School” with a general recommendation. I’ve already talked to them about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, my phone rang. On the screen were the words “Touya.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He probably wanted to ask about Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve made up my mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">From now on, I will work harder at soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I would forget about my feelings for Ruri. I thought so after meeting with Matsunaga-san today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, recently, Touya has been approaching Ruri, and it seemed he was working incredibly hard. It was a big difference from me, who just stayed together with her without any action.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, as his best friend, I should support his love life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hello, it’s Kenji.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After making a strong decision, I picked up the phone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that moment, I gave up my feelings for my childhood friend of more than ten years.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">One week later. I and Touya were in the finals of the Tokyo Metropolitan Tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If we won this game, we would advance to the national tournament. And I might get into “Teijo High School” with a special recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Incidentally, Touya and I had both been to the Tokyo tournament before, including elementary school, but had never been to the national tournament. So it was only natural that I wanted to win, but I was sure that Touya wanted to win too, no matter what it takes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nice pass, Takanashi!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I carefully received the pass from Takanashi.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Like in the previous game, Takanashi was usually so-so to me, but he still gave me passes. I guess it meant that he acknowledged me in some ways.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu~! Do it! Go for it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I heard Ruri’s energetic cheering, as usual. I’m a passer, so I can’t go for it… but her cheering still gave me strength.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the most important match, but my mind was surprisingly calm.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu! This way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya called from the front. The score was tied 0-0. It was overtime again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was almost the same as the previous game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t let their forwards get the ball!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the opposing team tried to surround me with multiple players, just like in the previous game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But if I pass the ball to Touya, he will always score. That was how we always had won.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If our soccer team made it to the national tournament, there was a chance that I could get into the special recommendation slot of Teijo High School.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With that thought in mind, I calmly assessed my opponent’s moves. Then, I found one of the enemy players surrounding me with a wide open crotch and an opening.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t always go for the between the leg pass…But if that was the best option…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I called out my best friend’s name and kicked the ball out to pass under the crotch of the player with the gap.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But the enemy player quickly closed his legs and stopped the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! No way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re looking too much at my crotch. It’s so obvious.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The player who stopped the ball said to me, who was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve done it. I thought I was calm… but I was in a hurry to win in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right! We’re going to go all out from here!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The captain of the opposing team gave the order, and all the other players ran to the front, leaving a few defenders behind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“H-Hey! Hold on!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I chased after them, but I couldn’t catch up with them at all because I’m tired from the overtime.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I was sure they were just as tired as I was… how much stamina do they have?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Everyone hurry back! We must defend our goal!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi instructed, and all our teammates tried to get back on the defensive.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, the enemy team’s players were too fast on the offensive, and one by one they were overtaken.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then &mdash; in the end &mdash; the opposing team’s forward even got past our goalkeeper and took a shot.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The final game of the Tokyo Metropolitan Tournament. The last game of the middle school tournament was lost because of my mistake.</p>

<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“What did I do…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After the game, I was walking home alone. Normally I would have gone home with Touya and Ruri, but I talked to them and asked them to leave me alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said, “I didn’t score a goal either, so don’t worry about it,” and my teammates said, “It’s not Kenji’s fault.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But it was completely my fault. I was very concerned about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How can I ever become a pro if I’m like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered discouragingly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now there was no more talk of getting a special recommendation from Matsunaga-san.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I returned home, I found that no one was home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Both of my parents were away all day today, apparently because they had some work they had to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, they didn’t come to watch today’s game either. …I was honestly glad they didn’t come to today’s game. If they came, I was about to show my parents how pathetic I was.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’m tired.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I placed my bag down and sat down in the doorway in my uniform. I don’t even feel like changing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After sitting there for a few minutes with nothing to do, the house phone suddenly rang.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I finally get up and go into the living room to pick up the phone, which has been ringing for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, this is Tanaka.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is it Kenji-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the other side of the phone was Matsunaga-san.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Matsunaga-san! What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I wanted to talk to you about something, and I’m glad you picked up, Kenji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Something you wanted to talk to me about…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, and by the way, umm… that game today was quite unfortunate.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I apologized at Matsunaga-san’s words.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Um… the special recommendation is…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, but I’m afraid I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked him with a ray of hope, but our deal was if I could win today’s game and go to the national tournament. The actual reason for this was that the game was lost and also my mistake was the cause of the loss. There was no way they would give me a special recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But you know, Kenji, everyone makes mistakes. Even professionals make mistakes. So don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san gently encouraged me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was still very hard for me mentally, but I felt a little better now that he said those words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you very much. So, I’ve decided… I’ll like to be admitted to Teijo High School on a general recommendation.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm, that’s the thing…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san sounds somewhat reluctant. What is it…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered why, and for some reason, I had an incredibly bad feeling about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, Matsunaga-san said──</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, but Kenji-kun is no longer allowed to be admitted to our high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hm!? W-What do you mean!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, Matsunaga-san seemed to have difficulty saying it, and began to explain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Actually, a few promising athletes have decided to join our school, and because of that, all of our recommendation slots have been filled.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“N-No way… So you’re saying that even the general recommendation slots are gone as well?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked, Matsunaga-san let out a troubled breath.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun didn’t get back to me about the recommendation. I am sorry, but I gave priority to those who made a decision before you did.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“H-How…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t believe that the recommendation was lost because I was too late in making my decision…</p>
<p class="calibre3">B-But! In order to make my dream come true, I can’t give up on this offer!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“P-Please! I’ll do anything, just please don’t cancel the recommendation!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This is a done deal, I can’t do it anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Please do something about that!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’m sorry, Kenji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san said in an apologetic voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The moment I heard that, I realized there was nothing I could do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why me… Why…? With my head in turmoil, I knew I had to at least ask this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Okay, so just one last thing…who are the few promising athletes who got in on recommendation?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, this isn’t really something I should talk about, but… I’ll tell you specially because of your feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, all the names that came out of Matsunaga-san’s mouth were people I had heard of at least once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were some of the best players in Tokyo, or nationally famous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And this time, one has been chosen to join us with a special recommendation.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…Is that so…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted this special recommendation by all means.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Who in the world got in…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm…that kid is actually&mdash;Touya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matsunaga-san hesitated before saying so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The moment my best friend’s name came up, my mind went blank.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why… Because that person should have gotten recommendations from more high schools.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There must have been dozens of schools that wanted him. So how was it that the only high school I’ve been recommended to, and the one I wanted so badly, was the one he had taken the special recommendation for…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was about to be crushed by my crumpled emotions when I realized that the call was disconnected.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why did I do that…?</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“Screw this…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After being told that the recommendation was off the table, I sat on a park bench, drooping.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The park was where Ruri, Touya and I used to play together, and where Touya had recently told me that he liked Ruri. It was already late in the evening and a bit cold, so there were no children around.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t a burden to my dad and mom…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was it my fault for being so slow in making the decision?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was I supposed to accept the offer of a general recommendation even if it inconvenienced my parents?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Damn, I don’t want to regret it, but I was regretting it right now…</p>
<p class="calibre3">And what a joke that Touya was getting into “Teijo High School” with a special recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but I know. It wasn’t his fault.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t tell him about my recommendation, and even if I had, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He just chose the best high school in his opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was wrong to hold a grudge against him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But honestly, it’s too hard…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The only chance to get a recommendation was the one that came to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t believe I let it slip away like this… I wonder if I could really become a professional like this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ya-hoo!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was feeling uneasy, I suddenly heard a lively voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I turned around and to my surprise, Ruri was standing right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s your reaction? You should be more surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri pouted in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre3"> “I was so surprised that I couldn’t speak. …Why are you here anyway?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri told me that after the match was over, she stopped by a coffee shop with Takanashi’s girlfriend &ndash; Asahi-san, who was watching the match with her, and they talked about today’s match.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They talked about how close it was, how that play was amazing, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After talking until she was satisfied, Ruri was going home by herself&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To my surprise, I found my childhood friend, who was apparently depressed, on a park bench!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…You called out to me because of that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s right!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri winked at me and pointed a finger at me. Normally, I would return even one of her light-hearted remarks…but I was not in the mood for that right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Sorry, but can you leave me alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri nodded vigorously and sat down next to me. You didn’t get it at all!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Ruri…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu is such a dummy. How can I leave a depressed childhood friend alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri said in a slightly angry tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Apparently, she didn’t intend to let me be alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Well, she has always been there for me in times like this before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you depressed about today’s game?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, but that’s part of it…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No? What’s wrong…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri asked in a concerned tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered if I should tell her about what just happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I would like to talk to Ruri and feel a little better.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But at the same time, I didn’t want her to see me looking pathetic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, we promised when we were little. If you are in trouble, I will help you! If I’m in trouble, you help me!””</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri smiled as she finished.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We had indeed made such a promise when we were little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And just as we promised, we have always helped each other out, even in the smallest of things.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, was it okay if I asked Ruri to help me this time too…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, actually, I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">First of all, I told Ruri that I had received an offer of recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t tell Ruri about the recommendation before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I also explained that the recommendation was no longer available.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, I didn’t mention the part about Touya’s admission to Teijo High School.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see, that’s what happened…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri turned her head slightly down with a sad expression on her face. I was ashamed to admit that just having her grieve with me like that made me feel a little better.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, now that the recommendations are gone, I guess I’ll just apply to some high school and join the soccer team.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah! I’ll definitely be there to cheer for the games when we go to high school!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri smiled cutely as she said this. Her words honestly made me happy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was why I had to tell her something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ever since I was little, I’ve been saying I’m going to be a professional soccer player…but if I enter a normal high school, it might be a little difficult.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It doesn’t mean that you have to join a strong school to become a pro.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But it was also true that it was easier to become a pro if you joined a strong school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, my best skill was passing, and I hated to say this, but the better the people around me were, the better I could pass and the more appealing I could be.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I could appeal to the right people, I might be able to catch the eye of a coach or manager at a college where I could play professionally, or maybe even a pro scout.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But if it were a normal high school, I&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’ll be fine!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A moment later, Ruri squeezed both my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so surprised that I tried to quickly break free, but Ruri would not let go.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A-About?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked her, flustered, and she began to speak with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That Kinu loves soccer more than anyone else! I know that you work harder than anyone else! I know all that!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So even if you lost the recommendation, you can still become a pro at a regular high school!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was desperately trying to encourage me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All the while, my hands remained clenched.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think she was trying to reassure me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was very happy to hear that, but there was one thing that surprised me more.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Ruri was crying.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009.jpeg" alt="" width="1344" height="1909" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3660" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009.jpeg 1344w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00009-1081x1536.jpeg 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1344px) 100vw, 1344px" /></p>
<p class="calibre3">She was shedding tears the whole time she was encouraging me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was encouraging me with her tears.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Not many people could cry for someone else, even a childhood friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I, who has been with her for a long time, know that Ruri was that kind of person.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that moment, my heartbeat became extremely fast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next time I saw Ruri’s face, I felt an urge that I can’t describe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then, I realized helplessly that I had to do something about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew it… that I really like her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you, Ruri. You’ve cheered me up a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really! That’s good!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri smiled reassuringly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was sweet and lovely and has always understood me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I called her name.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this moment, I had something in my mind that I must not do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s wrong? Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was still worried about me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing her like that, I cooled down for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What was I going to do now…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Was I going to confess my feelings to Ruri?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I must have lost my mind. Ruri wass the one whom Touya liked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I’ve made up my mind. I decided to give up your feelings for her and work hard at soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was going to work hard at soccer and become a professional soccer player…</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;But the recommendation was gone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile, Touya has been admitted to “Teijo High School” with a special recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, he has an admirable sporting talent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His academic ability was also outstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was well-liked and trusted by everyone around him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He has everything I don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thought about that, some dark feeling swirled inside me&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">I could at least confess to Ruri.</p>

<p class="calibre3">That was what I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya was kind, and I think he would at least allow me to confess my feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if I succeeded in confessing, he would understand if I talked to him properly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps he would even give me his blessing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Yes, I’m sure it will be fine. …It’s going to be okay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve got something to say to you, Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sound of my heartbeat intensified all at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason for this surge, however, was not only because I’m going to tell the person I love how I feel about her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it? What do you want to say?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri asked me with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m sure they still think I’m going to be weak or something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Actually, I…I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The words stop in mid-sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was not too late. It was not too late to turn back. That was what was pulling me back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But on the other hand, I also thought that now was the time to make a confession.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If Touya and Ruri got together, I would never be able to confess my feelings to her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If that was the case, then it’s now or never&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">My hands were shaking and my heartbeat was even more intense than before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Normally, I would have taken a deep breath to calm myself down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I didn’t care and told her.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“I like Ruri!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">The moment I confessed, I felt a throbbing pain in my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My heart was still beating, but probably not because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this was the right thing to do…was it?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Are you serious?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri asked in surprise after a few moments of silence. It was a natural reaction. I’ve been with her all this time, but I’ve never acted like I had feelings for her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s true. I really like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I-I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri muttered with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps she was confused.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Would I be able to go out with her by any chance?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The worst thought came to my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;But the next words that Ruri uttered destroyed all my stupid thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“I’m going out with Touya-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">…Eh? Ruri was dating Touya?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“U-Umm…When?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Just three days ago. Touya-kun confessed to me then.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After Ruri answered, she turned her face down a little as if she was uncomfortable. I had not heard anything from Touya. I wondered if he was going to tell me after the tournament was over since it was so close.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“S-So that’s what happened…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In short, it was too late for me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the contrary, my confession to my best friend’s target of love turned into a confession to my best friend’s girlfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the worst act in any case, but the latter meant that I might not be forgiven by Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Kinu, I thought you didn’t like anyone?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri asked abruptly as I was feeling uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Eh, why are you asking me that all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because umm…that’s what I heard from Touya-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri revealed in a slightly lost tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I did tell that to Touya…And he told Ruri…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t go out with Kinu, but we’ll always be childhood friends and we’ll always be friends! And I’ll be there to cheer for the game I just told you about!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Thank you. And… sorry about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Kinu’s feelings were…yes, I was happy. I was happy…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri would say that, but she had a complicated expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then she got up from the bench.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… I’m going to go now. See you later, Kinu!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Okay, bye.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After exchanging parting words, Ruri left the park by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The way she looked seemed to be running away from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’ve been rejected so spectacularly.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a confession that I had made by stepping on my best friend’s feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Moreover, Ruri was clearly in trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Betraying my best friend and causing trouble for my childhood friend…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I really am the worst.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">My mutterings were not heard by anyone and disappeared into the chilly air.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">The next day. I went to school alone. Considering what I did yesterday, I don’t have a face to meet with Touya, and I think it would be awkward if I met with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the first time since I entered middle school, and even elementary school, that I went to school alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I usually have someone to talk to, but being alone was pretty sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this thought in mind, I arrived at school and headed for my classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, Kenji!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I entered the classroom, Takanashi suddenly mumbled my name and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No, it wasn’t just Takanashi. For some reason, all of my classmates were looking in my direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Moreover, I felt that most of them were glaring at me a little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, what…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? It’s not ‘what’. Don’t play dumb with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi looked at me sharply and said angrily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This atmosphere was not a joke or a surprise…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But what do you mean, don’t play dumb?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">What are you talking about? I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Haa. I didn’t think Kenji was that much of a scum.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi put his hand on his forehead in disgust. What in the world?</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was completely unaware of the situation, a student emerged from a group of my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good morning, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“T-Touya…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The moment I saw my best friend’s face, my heart throbbed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I went all the way to Kinu’s house with Ruri, so why didn’t you go to school with us?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. I was feeling a little sick…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hmm, I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a conversation without much substance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And yet, Touya was showing his usual fresh smile. …Something was scary.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, Kinu. I have a question for you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-Is that so? What is it that you want to ask me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked him back, Touya kept his smile the whole time&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Did you confess to Ruri yesterday?”</p>

<p class="calibre3">A moment later, I felt a chill run down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If Ruri had told Touya about it…!?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked around the classroom and saw Ruri among my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;I was surprised to find that she turned her face away from me as soon as our eyes met.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There is no way that Ruri would really do such a thing… not when she has been with me for a long time and has been kind to me at all times. There must be some mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, did you hear me? Did you really confess to Ruri?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…t-that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was lost for an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think it was better to tell the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The only thing was, it was not good in this place with all the classmates gathered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, we are best friends. Tell me the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said in a reassuringly gentle tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that maybe he would forgive me if I told him the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I bowed my head deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was sorry, but the truth is that I liked Ruri too! That’s why I couldn’t hold back my feelings!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I honestly admitted that I had confessed my feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, with a smile on his face, he nodded in sympathy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. You couldn’t suppress your feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“T-That’s right. And when Touya asked me for advice about Ruri, I wasn’t really sure if I should help you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. So Kinu has been through a lot…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya returned the words in a sympathetic tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew that Touya would be fine. If I talked to him properly, he would understand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was relieved to see that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was when it happened&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Kinu is the worst.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">A low, sharp voice that I had never heard in the nearly four years we had been together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as I heard it, my heart froze.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Did you think I would say, ‘Well, I can’t help it, then I forgive you’?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“U-Umm…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya glared at me as much as, if not more than, my classmates from earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve never seen such a scary expression on his face before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve told you that I like Ruri. But then you confess, I guess you didn’t think of me as your best friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No way! I’ve always thought of you as my best friend&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then why did you confess!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya shouted angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre3">My classmates around me were astonished at the sight and I was speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Phew, I’m sorry. I just got a little bit mad.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">His expression returned to cool again, but I could sense that he was clearly angry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was all I did to him&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m in a relationship with Ruri, as you may have heard from her when you confessed your feelings to her. So I’ll never be able to fulfill Kinu’s wishes again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yeah, I know that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see… Then don’t ever mess with Ruri again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Despite his fresh voice, Touya warned me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course. I have no right to continue hanging out with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m glad you’re so understanding. Ah, but I’ve got one last thing I need to say.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As if remembering, Touya clapped his hands and…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, we’re done.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He continued in an indifferent tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-What…!? Don’t say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t do it. I don’t trust Kinu anymore. You’re not even my friend anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya was right. There was no room to argue with him at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So that’s what I’m going to say. Don’t get involved with me or Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri too… wait a minute. Can’t I talk to Ruri too?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…What are you talking about? I told you earlier not to mess with her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What…I thought you meant not to show off in front of her…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At my words, Touya sighed in exasperation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, don’t disappoint me any more. You deserve it after what you did.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“B-But…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t ever talk to Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya’s words came out in a stronger tone. I couldn’t say anything under that pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Touya, can I say something to this guy too?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi, who had been silent while Touya was talking, asked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya shook his head. Takanashi took a drink as if he was preparing to drink, and then slowly approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji, I know I’ve said a lot of things to you, but I trusted you in some ways.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Takanashi…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I looked at him, Takanashi looked a little sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed what he said was true. I had no idea that Takanashi felt that way about me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…but apparently I was wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A moment later, I was soaked from head to toe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I looked up in surprise, I saw that Takanashi had dumped a plastic drink bottle he was holding over my head. After getting even my uniform wet, the contents of the bottle seemed to be juice, and I ended up sticky all over.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“T-Takanashi, you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You scumbag.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takanashi dismissed the idea and headed back in the direction of his classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He admired Touya as much as I do. I was sure that was why he couldn’t forgive me for what I did. Still, I never thought he would go this far…</p>
<p class="calibre3">The drink seemed to have been chilled to a crisp, and even though it was May, it was indeed cold to be exposed to such things.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Seriously, that’s scummy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the boys from my classmates said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, as if in a chain reaction, other classmates began to say the same things.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You scum,” “It’s so terrible that you made a move on someone Touya likes,” “Don’t come to school anymore,” “You’re so gross,” “It’s not normal,” “Who do you think you are, Kinu?” “You betrayed him, confessed your feelings, and got rejected.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They and the girls looked at me with disdain and piled on the invective one after the other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had never seen anything like this before, and to be honest, I couldn’t stand this atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have certainly done terrible things to Touya, to my best friend. I couldn’t help what he did to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but my fellow teammates poured drinks on me, and my classmates abused me countless times…did I really have to go through all of this?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps, as expected, Touya might think this was too much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No, it was that Touya, it must be so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To&mdash;.!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Everyone, you can be harsher than that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as I was about to ask for help, Touya urged his classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was laughing at that moment. As if he was amused by the fact that I was going to be hurt even more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya, why…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered if I hurt him that much too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Speaking of which, I wonder what happened to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She might be able to do something to stop my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this in mind, I tried desperately to find her, but there was no sign of Ruri, who should have been there a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed that she had left the classroom before I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Aah, I kinda feel like pouring a drink on him, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the boys said, and just like Takanashi earlier, he came up to me with a plastic bottle and poured it over my head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This time, the bottle was new, not drunk, so even my school uniform pants were wet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The classmates were laughing at the sight of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…What bullsh*t this is.</p>

<p class="calibre3">From that day on, I began to be bullied by all my classmates, especially by Touya.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">I have been bullied every day since the day that my friendship with Touya broke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everyday I find all kinds of abusive comments written on my desk, and even if I erase them, they are written again a few minutes later. Naturally, no matter who I talk to, everyone ignores me. When I went into the bathroom, I was doused with a bucket of water, as if it was an imitation of a comic book or TV drama. All of this was done by Touya’s order.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This went on for a month, and my body and mind were in shambles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I still continued to go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason for this was because I wanted to talk to Touya and Ruri again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was bullied by Touya and told not to get involved with them again, but I wanted one last chance to talk to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if he doesn’t forgive me, I don’t care. At the very least, I wanted to apologize for what I had done.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this in mind, I continued to talk to Touya every day despite the bullying, but he never responded. I tried to talk to Ruri in the same way, but I was blocked by my classmates and couldn’t even get close to her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t think Ruri told Touya about my confession, though.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As a childhood friend who has spent a lot of time together, I just couldn’t believe that she would do something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Anyway, no matter how many times they avoided me or ignored me, I kept talking to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, will you please stop it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After school, behind the school building. Touya was glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I kept talking to Touya today, and he asked me to talk to him after school behind the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was happy to finally have a chance to talk to him, but it seemed that he called me to the back of the school building to stop me from acting one-sidedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You talk to me day in and day out and never get tired of it, and even though I told you not to get involved, you do the same thing to Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I just wanted to apologize properly to both of you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We don’t need it. I say again, don’t ever get involved with us again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya told me this and turned to leave from the back of the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt a little uncomfortable with him like that. …No, it wasn’t just now. Even on the day he told me he was done with me, I felt an inexpressible pull toward Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Touya. What’s going on? Umm… I have done the worst thing to you…but…I don’t think it’s right for me to say this… but, this doesn’t seem like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Not like me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya turned around and approached me, glaring sharply at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, he grabbed my collar and pushed me straight against the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kuh!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I received a big impact on my back and my voice leaked out. Touya was much taller than me and has a thin but strong body. I couldn’t move at all thanks to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was your fault for confessing your feelings to Ruri in the first place. And yet it’s not like me to be mad at you? Don’t be ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“N-No… that’s not what I’m trying to say…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said in a frightening manner and threw me to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I crashed into the ground. Ouch…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I get it. If you say I’m not being myself these days, I’ll tell Kinu the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya looked down on me with disdain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The expression on his face at that time was the scariest I have ever seen in our time together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What the heck was the truth…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the midst of my wondering, he began to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I hated you from the moment I met you, Kinu. You are always by my side even though you are inferior to me in every way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“!? W-What are you talking about!? I’ve been spending all this time with you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Touya’s words confused me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because it was impossible. We’ve been together since we were little, and we’ve played soccer on the same team for a long time. And yet, I couldn’t believe that Touya disliked me…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m saying that I didn’t like the fact that we were together all the time. But I had no choice but to stay with you because Ruri was there. The truth is, I didn’t want to be with you even for one second.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re lying… that has to be a lie…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself, and Touya shook his head from side to side.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It wasn’t a lie. In the past and now, I hate Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya stared at me and made it clear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I knew… whether I liked it or not. I knew that Touya really didn’t like me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So don’t come near me or my girlfriend again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As if to finish me off, he said those words. I couldn’t say anything back to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, Touya tried to leave, as if he had nothing more to say to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-Wait a minute! Let me ask you one last thing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…What? I have nothing more to say to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya’s eyes were so cold that I felt frozen when he looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was afraid…but there was something I really needed to ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Was it really Ruri who told you about my confession?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of course it was. Who else could it be?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“N-No way… But, she isn’t that kind of person…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even after hearing Touya’s answer, I, who had been with Ruri for a long time, could not believe that she would tell anyone that I had confessed to her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How do you know what kind of person she is? How can you be so sure? In fact, Ruri might not even like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He said that Ruri doesn’t like me… I’d like to think that was impossible, but if Touya doesn’t like me, then maybe she doesn’t either…There was a part of me that thought that way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I guess I shouldn’t have said this. Oh well, whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said, looking disinterested.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll see you later, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">With that, he left the back of the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was unable to move because I couldn’t sort out my feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…what the heck is going on already?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was at a loss for words, and I held my head in my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya never liked me and maybe Ruri didn’t like me either.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If Ruri really dislikes me…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was the only one who thought we were dear friends and childhood buddies.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess that’s what retribution is all about…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I got what I deserved for betraying my best friend. I got exactly what I deserved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My best friend has cut me off, and my childhood friend, the one I’ve always loved, might not even like me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…What am I supposed to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The words I muttered as if asking for help were not heard by anyone.</p>

<p class="calibre3">The next day, I didn’t go to school.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">It has been two weeks since I have been absent from school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I might already have one foot in truancy, or maybe both at this point.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even so, I couldn’t bring myself to go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I went to school, my classmates would give me a hard time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew that Touya and Ruri wouldn’t care about me anyway…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri must have told Touya about the confession after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I mumbled something like that as I crawled into bed, even though it was already time for classes to start.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was absent from school, I never heard from Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the past, when something like this happened, she would call me or even come to my house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But not at all this time. She hasn’t done so since she started dating Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Could it be that Ruri has been using me all this time to be with Touya?</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was what I’ve been thinking lately.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t say that it was impossible. After all, there was the case of Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With each passing day, Ruri took advantage of me, and the truth was that she hates me… and these thoughts began to take over my head…</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Stop messing with me.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">By the time I had been out of school for a month, I had come to hate Ruiri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Not only her. I also hated Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I bet they are both laughing at me right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I made a mistake, that was for sure. …But there was no reason for me to go through this kind of treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hope both Ruri and Touya suffer the same thing I did…</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even as I thought this, I found myself thinking of Touya as my best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I never lost my feelings for Ruri either.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even now, I could clearly say that I love her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My feelings were so messed up that I didn’t know what to do anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I hated myself the most.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;I must be a volatile person.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In the end, I never went to school from then until graduation.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">It has been about a year since I stopped going to school. I graduated from middle school to high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the last year of middle school, I almost didn’t apply to high school, but I studied at least a little by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I was wondering whether I should take the entrance examination or not, but I decided to take the examination so that I would not cause trouble to my parents.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I still couldn’t bring myself to go to school, so I didn’t go even once, and I ended up bothering my parents anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s go! I got 20 kills!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I exclaimed happily as I sat in my room playing a shooting battle royale game that had recently become popular.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ever since I started staying at home, I have been completely addicted to games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I now devote most of my time a day to gaming.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are too happy for a mere 20 kill game”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hear a cocky person’s voice through my headphones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shut up. I’m not as good as you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, I think you’re good too, Kinu. …Just, I’m better than you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What a way to talk. Now I’m mad.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The man laughed when I said that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The man’s name was Marumaru. We met through a game. Of course, Marumaru was not his real name, but a player name used in the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I also play the game under the player name “KN,” but it’s hard to call me “Keenu,” so I asked Marmaru to call me “Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I think it’s time for me to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, you’re done already?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well… We’ve been playing for about five hours.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because Marimaru, you always keep me company for short periods of time, but you only play games with me for long periods of time once in a while. With you, I can go another five hours.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s honestly nice of you to say that, but give me a break.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can picture Marumaru smiling bitterly. I’ll give him a break for today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, let’s play ranked tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ok, see you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After I heard those words, I didn’t hear Marmaru’s voice anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I turned off the game and lay down on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is it time for club activities now…?’</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was past four in the afternoon. If nothing had happened to me in middle school, I would have been practicing for the soccer team at high school right now. …But now I haven’t even touched a soccer ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Well, video games are fun and I don’t have to play soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was thinking about that when there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Oh, I guess my mom was off work today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But no matter how long it took, I didn’t hear my mom’s voice. …Eh, what?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered, and finally, I heard a voice through the door.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun. I’m the homeroom teacher for your class, my name is Kiritani Kakeru.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">It was the weak voice of a man I did not know.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I couldn’t see his face, but I thought he must have been a terrible person.</p>

<p class="calibre3">&mdash;But I didn’t know at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t know that he would save me from this disaster.</p>
