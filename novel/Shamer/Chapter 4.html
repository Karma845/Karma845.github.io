<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4 - Shamer</h1><div class="text-left">
				<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Tanaka! It’s only been an hour since you started running, and you’re already behind!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the soccer field of Seiran High School, while only the first-year students were running, I was scolded by a second-year senior member of the soccer team who was stretching. Incidentally, the third-year students had already retired, so the second-year students were now the oldest in the team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes! I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I apologized and then started running around the perimeter of the soccer field again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had been a week since I had started attending high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My ideal situation would have been to get along well with my classmates, play well in club activities, and gain the trust of my peers… but of course, it didn’t work out that way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was still distant from my classmates, and although the club activities were not long, the tournament was coming up, so the first-year students were mainly running, and I was in the same situation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, it has been about a year since I’ve been to school, and I haven’t practiced soccer much, so it couldn’t be helped. I should work up steadily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…But, why is she here?”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013.jpeg" alt="" width="1163" height="1651" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3664" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013.jpeg 1163w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013-768x1090.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00013-1082x1536.jpeg 1082w" sizes="(max-width: 1163px) 100vw, 1163px" /></p>
<p class="calibre3">While running, I glanced toward where the bench was.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was the advisor there, and Ruri was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was, to my surprise, the manager of the soccer team. And she had just recently started as well. I don’t know whether the timing was good or bad…</p>
<p class="calibre3">Speaking of which, I wonder how things were going for her with Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t intend to do anything as awful as I did in middle school ever again, but I was simply curious.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, I guess they were still dating. Touya, like me, has been in love with her ever since he was little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mmm!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked at Ruri and my eyes accidentally met hers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We immediately look away from each other. …It was awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve not spoken to Ruri at all since the first time I went to school up until today, except for our initial greeting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I wanted to ask her what she thought of me when I was being bullied in middle school. Or, if she disliked me since she was little? I had so many questions I wanted to ask her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I tried to talk to her, but she kept avoiding me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, because she avoided me, it might mean that she really disliked me from a long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if that’s the case, I’d like to hear it from her at least.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And although I hated her so much when I was a shut-in, when I met her, the joy of seeing the person I love again was greater than my hatred. I’m really… pathetic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I was relieved that I don’t have to hate the person I love anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka! Speed up!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After receiving another scolding from my senpai, I started running faster.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I needed to do more running on my own from now on. I was going to die if I didn’t get stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this thought in mind, I ran, gasping for air.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, I passed by the bench, and naturally, stole a glance at it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To my surprise, I saw that she was smiling.</p>

<p><br></p>

				<p class="calibre3">It was break time the next day and I was heading to the science lab because we were doing a chemistry experiment in my next class.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ow…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was holding my thighs as I walked down the hallway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though I’ve been doing club activities for over a week now, I still always get sore muscles every day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t moved my body at all for almost a year. The consequences of my actions were huge indeed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I guess it was not that easy to live like myself…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You seem to have a lopsided stride.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I heard a man’s voice from up ahead, and when I turned my head up to look.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei was right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It looks like you’re doing a lot of hard work in your club activities, Kenji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m just doing what I’m told by sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei smiled kindly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, I use honorifics for Kiritani-sensei at school. …Well, I should have used honorifics when he was visiting me at home, but I didn’t have the right timing… I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was my homeroom teacher, so we’ve talked a lot since my first day at high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I first met him at school, he was surprised but very happy and I was also very happy to see him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the way, how are things going with Aima-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri… well, it is the same as ever.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei sounded disappointed when he responded. I told him about Ruri earlier. She was one of the reasons I stopped going to school, and she was the person I still love.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But I think I’ll talk to her without being discouraged. My high school life has just begun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, you’re right. If you ever need anything, don’t hesitate to talk to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you very much! You’re the best teacher!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I’m not. I’ve told you many times, but I’m your homeroom teacher, so it’s only natural.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Even so, you’re a great teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was sure if I talked to Kiritani-sensei about it, he would try his best to help me like he did when I was a shut-in. …However, I wanted to solve the problem with Ruri on my own.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was my way of making up for the mistakes I made in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I hope you’ll do your best with Aima-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, I will do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After exchanging last words like that, Kiritani-sensei and I parted ways.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was rooting for me, too. Next time, I would definitely talk to Ruri.</p>

<p class="calibre3">…As much as I was enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No progress at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It has been another week since then, and Ruri still avoided me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This might have just solidified that she really doesn’t like me…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve heard this once from Touya in middle school, so I was shocked as hell, but I don’t think this would send me back to being a shut-in again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, the Ruri thing is important, but I have other things to do&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve recently been into the anime on Mi-Tubes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Like Mio May and Morimori Molly, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, yes! There are so many funny stories, like the one where they use up all the secret sauce, or the kid haggling over the price for the first time at the store, and so on!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the morning in the classroom. Two boys were talking happily nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was a chance to get to know them… but I have no idea what they’re talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I guess they’re doing anime on mi-tubes these days.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had never heard of it because I had only seen commentary videos on games before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hurriedly pulled out my phone and searched for it, and sure enough, an anime appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can really watch anime too? …That’s amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While being impressed, I searched for the channel the boys were talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Found it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I looked at the titles, all the videos looked interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the most interesting was…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know the ones where they take a blindfolded surprise detour?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I tried to talk to the boys as I showed them the screen of my phone &mdash; but unfortunately, they had already gone somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Haa.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I let out a big sigh. I’ve been trying to talk to my classmates like this many times since I first went to school, but I keep failing because of my bad timing and the way I talk to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I want to get along with my classmates as soon as possible…but it was hard to be myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;Then, I felt a gaze on me unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I looked, I saw that Ruri was fiddling with her phone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t talked to her yet today…Just to make sure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, look at me right now&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maki-chan, good morning!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly Ruri stood up and went to her friend. She avoided me again…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve been trying to talk to Ruri like this for two weeks now and I was still not getting along with my classmates. I couldn’t keep up with my club activities because I was not strong enough. On top of that, Ruri was still avoiding me …Well, I was in a pretty bad situation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But that doesn’t mean I’m going to let myself rot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All I had to do was to present myself more aggressively to my classmates, increase my physical strength by increasing the amount of independent practice, and keep talking to them without being discouraged by the loneliness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Marumaru, I’m going for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I braced myself as I muttered the name of my departed companion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since he said goodbye to me, all of his social networking and gaming accounts have been deleted. It was not like he stopped playing games or anything, but he was probably just trying to look out for me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I had the accounts, I could always get in touch with him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was the one who said goodbye to me so that I wouldn’t run away again and be stuck in a corner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was sure he would do it to the point that he would delete his account.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He would probably be playing the game under another name and posting clips by now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, are you good at ‘Zomabrawl’?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was absentmindedly thinking about Marumaru, a classmate suddenly spoke to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think he was Sasaki-kun, a member of the basketball team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I guess…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really!? Actually, I’m going to have a Zomabrawl tournament with my classmates at my place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. That sounds like fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, I was wondering if you could give me some tips on how to play Zomabrawl?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well… that’s fine…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really! I’m so happy!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki was happy, but while we were talking, I had a question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How did he know I was good at Zomabrawl?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Not only have I never said a word to my classmates, I haven’t even talked to them properly in the first place…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Um… How did you know I was good at Zomabrawl?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, that’s, uh, Ai&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Stop! If you talk any more, I’ll kill you☆”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The one who interrupted our conversation was Maki-chan&mdash;Or rather, Kudo-san whom Ruri went to talk to earlier. She was choking Sasaki-kun. Hey, hey, isn’t this too much…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ugh, ugh, pain…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re the one who’s trying to talk nonsense. Shut up for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Sasaki-kun weakly replied, Kudo released him by removing her arm from around his neck.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good morning! Tanaka-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“G-Good morning…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry. I know you must have been scared when this idiot suddenly started talking to you. As his childhood friend, I apologize.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it’s okay, I was just happy that he talked to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t know Sasaki-kun and Kudo-san were childhood friends. That was news to me. But in the end, I couldn’t figure out how Sasaki-kun knew I was good at Zomabrawl…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, if you want, why don’t you come to the next Zomabrawl tournament, Tanaka-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Me…? Umm, will you be there too, Kudo-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of course! I’ll be there to beat this man to a pulp!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san said as she turned her attention to Sasaki-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They’re close…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So? I’d prefer to have more people, but do you want to join?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. But&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m an outsider, aren’t I? I was about to say that, but I stopped myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was my chance. I’ve never been able to get along with my classmates no matter how I try, but this was a great chance for me to finally get to know them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I showed them how good I was at games and showed them my knowledge of Zomabrawl, I may be able to close the gap between me and my classmates in no time at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Can I come to that tournament?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, you’re so flippant~ that’s the way to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san gave a thumbs-up. You’re the one who’s flippant though.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m going to need you to teach me how to play Zomabrawl before the tournament.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Got what? Heh.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki-kun laughed. He was a little nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt someone’s eyes on me again from somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I turned my eyes, I saw Ruri there, happily chatting with her friends.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Was it my imagination?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Everyone take your seats!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The classroom door opened and Kiritani-sensei walked in. It was time for morning homeroom to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki-kun, Kudo-san, and the rest of the classmates were all returning to their seats.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had originally been sitting in my seat, so I stayed there until Ruri returned to the seat next to mine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She sat in her seat, looking nonchalant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought I felt her eyes on me twice today…was I mistaken? Over self-consciousness?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Or was it&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">Homeroom began, leaving me with such a bewildering feeling.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka! You’re the slowest one today!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After school. All the first-year students were running at club activities, and as usual, I was the only one being yelled at by my seniors.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While the second-year students were practicing passing in pairs, the first-year students continued to focus on running.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I apologized and sped up with all my might. I’ve been increasing the amount of running in my voluntary training, and I was sure my body will get used to it in another week. …This was the time to step up to the plate.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji, are you okay~?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was running, breathing quite unevenly, I was approached by a male student running in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was Kudo-senpai, and he was the only student who talked to me in the school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was also the head of the soccer club and the ace of the team. He had competed in a national tournament in middle school, but he had decided to enter Seiran High School only because it was close to his home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In fact, he seemed to be coming off an injury, so he was practicing the same menu as the first-year students for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, the other members of the club were appalled that I was not keeping up with the practices, even though I joined the club in the middle of the year, and they scolded me, but no one actually talked to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I was a sportsman myself, and I fully understood how they feel, so I’ll just have to work hard from now on and gain their trust little by little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry. I’m fine, you can go ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t be so considerate. We’re all in the same club. …but I just simply don’t like to run.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai smiled when I ran next to him. He was a good-looking guy, probably very popular with the girls</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the way, Kenji, do you have a girlfriend?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s this all of a sudden…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well. I thought it would deepen the friendship between seniors and juniors.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai said so with a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was at the physical end of my rope, I didn’t have time to talk about this…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t have any. I mean, I’ve never been able to get one before.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, r-really?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For real.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was someone I like, though. She was doing her manager’s job well today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. I thought you definitely…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai mumbled something, but his voice was too low to be heard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought about asking him back, but I was too exhausted to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I managed to finish the run with Kudo-senpai.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ugggh…I’m really going to throw up…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I fell to my knees and gasped for air.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other members of the club were looking at me like I was a fool while I was trying to catch my breath.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everyone on the team was all running the same distance, except only one of them &mdash; the one who joined the club in the middle of the year &mdash; was exhausted, so of course they would react like this. It was just the way it was.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ohhh~, you look like you’re about to die today too~!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai was staring at me, still unable to stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This guy was running the same distance as me and the other first-year students, but he was not out of breath at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What kind of physical strength does he have?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There’s no need to apologize. You’ll get used to it anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Saying that, Kudo-senpai extended his hand to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After thanking him, I took his hand and managed to stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Ah, I still feel a little nauseous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We’re doing a practice match later.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first-year students will probably be running, dashing, and running again, anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The tournament was just around the corner. The actual ball was basically only for the second-year students to practice with.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I guess it would be different for the first years if they could get a regular spot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji, you’re joining us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai said something I couldn’t quite get, so I asked him back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes? I said you’re participating in a practice match.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What… but I’m a first-year, though?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m going to start bringing in some first-year students today. So I picked Kenji. …Oh, by the way, I’ll be participating in that practice starting today too. Understood?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Uh…yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t quite caught up with reality, but for some reason, they’re going to let me participate in the practice match.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Seriously, what does that mean?</p>

<p class="calibre3">“We’re going to start a practice session now where you’ll have to play in a real game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the center of the soccer court, the advisor said this and put the ball on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two members of the club were standing across the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One was Kudo-senpai.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the other was Takahashi-senpai, the vice president of the club.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai was the senpai who scolded me a lot, and I have been scolded by many senpais.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai was on my enemy team, and Kudo-senpai was on my side.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s have fun, Kenji.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Y-Yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was still not fully grasping the situation when Kudo-senpai said this to me, so I responded reflexively.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I stood on the soccer court without knowing why, why did Kudo-senpai pick me in the first place?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was happy… I honestly have no idea why I was here.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wasn’t even able to keep up with the running practice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji’s position is in the middle.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? The middle…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think he meant volante, which was a position that mainly involves passing the ball around. The way he said it was too normal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Also, how did he know my position in middle school? I never told him my position, and I never even practiced by touching the ball, so how could he know?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The questions didn’t just remain, they increased, and without any answers I moved to my assigned position.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then we begin!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The advisor said loud enough for the club members on the court to hear, then sounded the whistle. It was the kickoff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When our team kicked the ball, all the players on the court began to move in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I haven’t touched the ball in voluntary training… is it going to be fine?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I ran along with my teammates’ movements, feeling uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this was the best opportunity to gain the trust of the team members. If I showed good play in this practice, other club members besides Kudo-senpai might start talking to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as I was thinking that, a member near me picked up the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Over here!</p>
<p class="calibre3">I raised my hand and shouted. The player with the ball glanced at me and then passed the ball to another player.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was free now and he could have made the pass.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…No, maybe I didn’t make enough of an appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next time, I’ll call for a pass more clearly. I got myself together and continued to play.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the game, I repeatedly called out for a pass, but after ten minutes, no one gave me one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was completely hacked off…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I never thought I would have so little trust from the club members. …Well, it was no surprise when they saw the running training.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, what shall I do?</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I wanted to play well but couldn’t touch the ball, it was a huge problem.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, don’t skip out on the team!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai, who had moved all the way over here from his front-line position, said to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I’m not skipping out, I’m just not getting any passes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I know, I’m kidding, kidding.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai was laughing. However, I was not laughing over here.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then let me give you a little advice, to you who don’t have the trust of your fellow seniors.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You say terrible things to your junior without mercy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Listen to me. If you can’t get a pass, just steal the ball from the enemy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai had a rather wicked smile on his face as he said this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To be honest, our level isn’t that high, and maybe Kenji can do it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What does senpai know about me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, a lot of things. That’s why when you get the ball, you’re gonna pass it to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After responding appropriately to my question, Kudo-senpai returned to his position.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What in the world is this guy… I thought so, but his advice was sound, so I decided to go for the ball right away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What the heck, you’re my opponent?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And so I was confronted by Takahashi-senpai, the vice captain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was looking at me with eyes that were clearly bored.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I could see that he was caught off guard, like there was no way he was going to lose to a guy like me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Whatever. Just get out of the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai dribbled after saying that in an uninterested manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Feinting to the right and left, he tried to fake me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was the vice captain so he was pretty good at it. But he was not as good as Touya…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was anticipating his movements, and I put my foot out at the exact timing I thought was right.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nah!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai let out a surprised cry as I neatly stole the ball from him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I left him there and dribbled up to the front line.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Over here, Kenji!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I turned my eyes to see Kudo-senpai running at a good distance away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No, he was too far away. I was not supposed to pass the ball at such a distance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji! This way, this way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai called me repeatedly. He really wanted me to make the pass.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I don’t know if it would work, but if I could make the pass here, the club members would trust me a little more. Then I have no choice but to do it!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kudo-senpai!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Calling out his name, I took aim and kicked the ball as hard as I could.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ball went straight down to Kudo-senpai.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then&mdash;it landed perfectly at his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nice pass!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo gave a thumbs-up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so happy that I couldn’t help but give him a thumbs-up too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition, I raised my fist in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It has been a long time since I’ve had this feeling of a clean pass. It felt really good.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After receiving the pass, Kudo-senpai broke through the enemy defense in no time, and scored a goal. This person is just too good… As expected of a national level player.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You made a good pass…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai called out to me from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I don’t think he was being sarcastic or anything, I think he was genuinely complimenting me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How did you develop those kinds of passes?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt a little pressure from Takahashi-senpai who asked that question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…Well, since I was in elementary school, I used to mark the wall, the ground or in the park and hit the ball against it from different distances.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Just that? Did you learn it through such basic practice?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s right. Yes, I did that for about five hours every day.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t do it when I was a shut-in, but I started the same practice again when I started club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! Five hours…!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi was so surprised that his eyes were wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had to practice that much because I had no other weapon than passing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… Sorry. I yelled at you during practice for nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai suddenly apologized.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I didn’t keep up with the practice, it was natural, I don’t mind at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I still overdid it. Sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Takahashi-senpai deeply bowed his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought he might be a scary person, but he was a good person, just a little too passionate.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was thinking&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s with your pass? That’s awesome! I thought you were unmotivated when I saw you practicing, but you can’t do that unless you work hard. Let’s get fit fast and play in a game together!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The club members all gathered around me and praised me for my earlier play.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed that my appeal was successful.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think I’ve gained a lot of the club members’ trust with this. …I’m glad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Boys, we’re in the middle of a game! Get back into position!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The advisor pointed out, and all the members returned to their positions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then the practice session continued for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I made good pass after good pass, and Kudo-senpai scored all the goals.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this way, I steadily gained the trust of the club members through this practice match.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Good work~”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was changing in the locker room after the whole practice, Kudo-senpai called out to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other members had quickly left, and it was just me and Kudo-senpai in the room.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thanks for your hard work.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You made a lot of good passes. Thanks to you, we scored a lot of goals.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai was in a good mood as he changed his clothes. When he took off his clothes, his steel-like body was revealed. I didn’t notice it when he was wearing his uniform, but it was hard to believe he was a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t stare at me too much. Are you a pervert?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m not. Don’t say things that could be misinterpreted.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I replied, Kudo-senpai laughed in an amused way. What was so funny…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… May I ask you one question?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it? I have a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m not interested in that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why not? You should be interested in her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai sincerely appealed to me, but since I could not proceed if I kept responding to him, I let his comments pass through for the time being and asked him a question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai said that you appointed me, but why did you let me participate in the match today?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had always wondered. There were many first-year students who were able to keep up with the training better than me, and there were also many players who were bigger than me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to know why Kudo-senpai picked me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I actually knew about Kenji for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! You knew about me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, that’s right. It was about this time last year.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he began to talk.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About a year ago.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day when I was in the third year of middle school, Touya and I made it our goal to get to the finals of the Tokyo Metropolitan Tournament to participate in the National Tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed that Kudo’s younger brother was at the game and he was also watching.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was watching the game, and even though I made a mistake that caused us to lose, he seemed to remember that I had made many good passes in the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So that’s why you assigned me to the practice match?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right. Your passing accuracy is at a level that can be used on a national level.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai, said something outrageous without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">National level… Surely that was an exaggeration.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And also, the manager of the same class as you asked me&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There, Kudo-senpai stopped speaking. Immediately after, he makes a face like “Oh sh*t!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The manager in the same class as me…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri did?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked. Kudo-senpai’s eyes darted left and right, then he let out a deep sigh as if he had given up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. Actually, my sister and Aima-san are friends, and we used to know each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri’s friend… Is your sister Kudo Maki, by any chance?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What, you know Maki?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai looked surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked him because they have the same last name and she was a friend of Ruri’s, and I guess I was right.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, that’s why Aima-san asked me to include Kenji in today’s practice match.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri told you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had no idea. She still doesn’t speak a word to me at school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Aima-san had told me not to talk about it, but I accidentally did.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai puts his hand on his forehead in dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She even tried to keep me in the dark and get me to practice behind my back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why did Ruri go to such lengths for me…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But well, I was originally going to let Kenji join the practice. I knew you were good at soccer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was honestly happy to hear Kudo-senpai’s words, but my head was filled with questions about Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe she doesn’t hate me…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll put you in the same practice tomorrow as I did today. You should rest your body well~.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah… Y-Yes. I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then good night. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-senpai finished changing his clothes and left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Tomorrow will be the same practice. I’ll have to play better than I did today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But I see. Ruri…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was helping out at practice today as manager, it seemed like it was business as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why did she go to the trouble of asking Kudo-senpai, the captain, to let me participate in the practice match?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought about it the whole time I was getting dressed, but no matter how much I thought about it, I still couldn’t figure it out.</p>

<p><br></p>

				<p class="calibre3">A few days later. I continued to play well at club practice, steadily gaining the trust of the club members. And soon enough, I was selected to start in a practice game just before a tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I heard that my advisor had also been impressed with my performance in the past few days of practice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, I continued to try to talk to Ruri, who was still avoiding me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had more and more questions I wanted to ask her…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka-kun, aren’t you too strong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki-kun said to me while looking at the TV screen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Today was the day of the “Zomabrawl” tournament, which he had previously announced.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After I finished my club activities on our day off, I went to Sasaki-kun’s house, which was relatively close to the school. Because his parents had a lot of money, his house was as big as a mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, Sasaki-kun’s room was so spacious that it was hard to believe it was for one person, and about ten of our classmates were gathered there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, the first round had already started, and I won outright against Sasaki-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I had promised, I had taught Sasaki-kun how to play “Zomabrawl” the night before, but I guess he couldn’t beat a former stay-at-home gamer like me with just one night of soaking in the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was clapped. It’s so frustrating.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, it is my favorite game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I still thought I could do a little better. It’s pathetic that the tournament organizer lost in the first round.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki looked down in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Certainly, it might have been a bad idea to beat the tournament organizer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But there was a situation here, too, where I had to show my good side in the game and get along with my classmates. I couldn’t lose so easily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka is too strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, a boy who was watching the game between me and Sasaki-kun called out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No, not just him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Teach me your favorite combo next time” “Teach me too!” “Teach me your favorite character.” “Do you have any tips on how to win a match?” Do you play any games other than Zomabrawl?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">My male classmates started talking to me more and more like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I recommend this combo&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I answered one by one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, one after another, including Sasaki-kun, started talking to me in the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You guys. You’re bothering Tanaka-kun if you ask so much of him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was being surrounded, Kudo-san appeared and warned the boys.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately after that, the boys responded and began preparing for their next match.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve learned over the past few days that Kudo-san seemed to be the big sister of the class.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had just fought Sasaki-kun and my next match wouldn’t be for a little while, so I moved toward where the drinks were when Kudo-san approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the way, Tanaka-kun is so strong!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, there are people stronger than me all over the place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, there is no one stronger than you. Don’t be modest.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san said so, but I wasn’t being modest, and there were some really strong people around me who were much stronger than I was.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, my homeroom teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thanks for taking down Shunsuke for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh… O-Oh.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">By Shunsuke, she meant Sasaki-kun?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, she joined the tournament to defeat Sasaki-kun… But I took him down instead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Somehow, the two of them seem to be a good fit… it might have been better to lose on purpose after all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maki-chan! I got some candy from Sasaki-kun’s mom!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, a lively voice rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked and saw that Ruri had brought a bowl full of sweets.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“”Ah…””</p>
<p class="calibre3">When our eyes met each other’s, we both let out a squeal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But it became awkward and we quickly looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was not participating in the tournament, but she was visiting Sasaki-kun’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her friend Kudo-san was here, so she came to visit with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thanks, Ruri-chan! Let’s eat the snacks together!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Y-Yes. Sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri replied, and there was silence between the three of us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was probably because of me and Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Ruri&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, all the drinks are gone. I’ll go get some more.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After saying that, Ruri left the room in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve tried to approach her several times today, but she continued to avoid me as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Haaa. When will I be able to talk to her?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri-chan and Tanaka-kun are childhood friends, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, yes… how do you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I heard it from Ruri-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">What did Ruri say to Kudo-san?</p>
<p class="calibre3">It would be tough if she said something like &mdash; I have a childhood friend I hate.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But there is a strange distance between Ruri-chan and you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s because, umm… there were a lot of things that happened in the past, so Ruri might hate me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, she even tried to get me to participate in practice matches. Sometimes I think she doesn’t hate me, but when she keeps running away from me when I try to talk to her like this, I think she hates me after all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I don’t think that’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why do you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because the other day, she told Shunsuke that Tanaka-kun was good at Zomabrawl.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ngh! I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After Sasaki-kun talked to me at that time, I had a vague idea that was the case.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The only classmate who knew that I was good at Zomabrawl was Ruri. I thought it couldn’t be true, since she usually avoided me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Oops.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“? What’s wrong, Kudo-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I forgot that Ruri-chan told me not to tell you what I just said.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san has a look on her face like she made a mistake. Siblings act the same I guess…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can’t help it if I’ve done it already. I’ll tell you one more thing, Tanaka-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the way, that’s probably a definite no-no.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I pointed out, but Kudo-san continued to talk without stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know, Ruri-chan has been talking about Tanaka-kun quite a bit.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, especially since Tanaka-kun came to school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whenever I had a good play at club practice, she always told Kudo-san about it the next day at school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition, if Kudo-san asked a question about me out of curiosity, Ruri seemed to happily talk about things from when we were little that even I normally wouldn’t remember.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So I don’t think it’s possible that Ruri-chan doesn’t like Tanaka-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was quite encouraged by what Kudo-san said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still wasn’t completely sure, but maybe Ruri really doesn’t hate me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Okay, I’ll try to get her to talk to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t come up with any particular plan or anything, though…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka-kun! It’s your second round next!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki-kun said, and I moved toward the TV screen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t think I can play “Zomabrawl” properly in my current state…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go for it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san gave me a light yell from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this probably wasn’t about Zomabrawl.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And so began the second round of the Zomabrawl tournament, which I again won outright.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“The winner is Tanaka-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Sasaki-kun announced the winner of the Zomabrawl tournament, the boys applauded in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was kind of embarrassing…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka-kun was really strong. If you like, I’ll invite you to come next time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, I can come next time, too?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Sasaki answered, the other boys said, “Let’s play one more time,” or “I’ll win this time,” and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had only played properly with Ruri and Touya in the past, so when they said this to me, I felt a joy I had never felt before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt like I had achieved my goal of becoming friends with my classmates, which I had set when I went to school. I hoped I could make friends with more people like this in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well then, it’s late, so let’s go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sasaki-kun said to everyone, and everyone who had come to play got ready to leave and headed out of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I went outside as well and saw Ruri outside as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had not been able to talk to her once since our earlier encounter, due to the effects of winning the tournament and playing a lot of games in a row.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Recently, I’ve been doing well in club activities, and today was the first time I hung out with people other than Ruri and Touya and became friends with them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, maybe I can get back the relationship I used to have with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had such faint hopes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to talk to her one last time. This was my last chance today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, can I&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as I spoke to her, Ruri turned her back and tried to run away, as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I thought I might be able to make up with Ruri, and after hearing what Kudo-san said. I knew it wouldn’t be good to spend any more time without talking to her, so I reached out my hand as quickly as I could.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wait!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I grabbed Ruri’s arm and she turned around in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah… S-Sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I let go of her arm and apologized.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it’s okay… Bye then.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri said that and tried to leave again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What should I do? At this point, I’ll fail once again…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The two of you over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hear a girl’s voice from behind me. When I turned my head, I saw Kudo-san there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll walk you two until the halfway point.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maki-chan, why are you suddenly…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why… Well, it’s for whatever. Besides, you’ve known each other since childhood, right? You probably live in the same direction, so why don’t you two go home together?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As Ruri was lost in thought, Kudo-san then turned to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tanaka-kun, you’re good too, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, it’s settled!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san clapped her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This girl doesn’t listen to other people’s opinions at all!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wait a minute. I haven’t said anything going home&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t care about that kind of thing. I’m going home with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san pushed Ruri’s back and forcefully walked with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While doing that, she turned around and looked at me, signaling me to come quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">If we were going home together, I might have a chance to talk to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I followed them, I began to plan out my approach.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Shunsuke, you know, has always been a crybaby, and the bad kids in the neighborhood used to pick on him and make him cry.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As the three of us walked down a quiet residential street, Kudo-san shared her childhood stories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I beat those bad boys up myself in the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san must have been quite the martial kid.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But you know, even though Shunsuke is a weakling, he has always remained kind ever since he was a little boy. He always helps me out when I’m in trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san had gentle eyes as she said this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps she really cared about Sasaki-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I somehow felt that way when I saw Kudo-san talking about Sasaki.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think childhood friends are different from ordinary friends in that they know each other deeply, and because of that, they fight and help each other out.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Kudo-san started talking about what childhood friends are like.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why is she saying this…? I was a little puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t know what happened between you two, but you should at least talk about it! Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san said, looking in the direction of Ruri, who had been silent ever since a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maki-chan… but I…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You can’t solve anything by running away forever. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san asked with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And Ruri fell silent, as if conflicted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, it’s almost time to go home, so I think I’ll say goodbye now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kudo-san said in a tone as if she had done her part.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You two are free to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">With a final “bye-bye” to Ruri and me, she walked off in the direction where her house would be.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, it was just the two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I see. So the reason Kudo-san asked me and Ruri to go home together was to give us a chance to talk properly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If that was the case, I needed to have a proper talk with Ruri for her sake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri, can I talk to you for a minute?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked her, she looked as if she was unsure of what to say.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thanks to Kudo-san, she won’t be able to escape as quickly as she did before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After a few moments, Ruri answered in a subdued voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m glad. At last, I could finally have a proper talk with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We can talk as we walk.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then we started to walk next to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had been a long time since I walked with Ruri like this… Honestly, I was happy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I also had another thought.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to feel the same way when I walk with Ruri in the future.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Ever since we were little, we always walked side by side like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. Because we’ve known each other since we were kids.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri and I talked about the old days as we walked next to each other on our way home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I would have liked to get right to the point, but unfortunately I didn’t have the courage to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe I just wanted to continue the conversation with her as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you remember? When we were in elementary school, I fell down hard in a soccer game and got a deep cut on my knee, and you saw it and cried that I was going to die.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! W-Why are you talking about that all of a sudden? Kinu no baka!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was angry, but she also looked a little bit happy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had been a long time since I had been able to talk to her like I used to.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I could talk to her like this all the time&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But that was never going to happen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know… I have a lot of questions I want to ask Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes, I suppose so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri returned the words apologetically.　</p>
<p class="calibre3">She didn’t avoid me like she had in the past, and she talked to me properly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She’ll be able to answer my questions now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Depending on Ruri’s response to the questions I was about to ask, there is a possibility that I may be severely hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, no matter what she says, I’ll accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t want to run away from the reality of who I am, as I did when I was in a depression.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have you always hated me, Ruri?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as I asked this question, my heart started to beat faster and faster.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are a lot of other questions I want to ask… but this is the one I’ve been wondering the most.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was in middle school, Touya told me. Ruri never liked me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She has been with me since we were little, and now, I really don’t know if she doesn’t like me or not.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I really wanted to know the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, Ruri smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that moment, I was convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew that Ruri did not hate me after all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I had remained at home, I would never have known this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m glad that I accepted that I was full of mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m glad I made the decision to be myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m really glad&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">“I hate you.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was taken aback by Ruri’s answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Did she say she hated me…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">N-No way. She had just smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Were you expecting something? That I would answer that I don’t hate you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri said with a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was she smiling on purpose to trick me?</p>
<p class="calibre3">So she really hated me for all this time…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hey, relax. It may be a little early to judge yet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I heard…from the Kudo siblings. They told me that you told Sasaki-kun that I was good at Zomabrawl for me and that you asked Kudo-senpai to let me participate in the practice match.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s…Just a little help, since we’ve known each other for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri responded in that way, but I felt that it was off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you really hate me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked her again, just to be sure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If she still said she doesn’t like me, then I have no choice but to admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was ready to admit it&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I told Touya-kun that Kinu confessed to me when we were in middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri told me the second thing that had been bothering me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was shaken when I heard this, but she continued on regardless.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I didn’t help Kinu when you were being bullied by the others, and I didn’t even visit you at home when you stopped going to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri revealed what has happened up to now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As she revealed one by one, my agitation grew.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And finally, she said again.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“It was all because I hated Kinu.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">The second time I heard her say it, I couldn’t say anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This time she had her eyes down and I couldn’t see her expression clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, I’d be lying if I said I still didn’t feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps she was lying to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But whatever the case may be, if Ruri said hated me this much, I probably shouldn’t get involved with her anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see… I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said a few words back and that was where the conversation stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We were walking in silence when we arrived at Ruri’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…See you tomorrow, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After exchanging a final farewell, Ruri went inside her house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Tomorrow, I will not be able to talk to her at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt sad thinking about it, even though she told me to my face that she hated me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess I still like Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I realized I still had feelings for her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…It’s too late now. I can’t tell her how I feel.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s okay, it’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve started going to school, I’m playing soccer to the best of my ability, I’ve gained the trust of the club members, I’m getting along well with my classmates, and I’m living my life my way, as myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I’m okay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I should head home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I started walking alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that I’ve made friends with Sasaki-kun and his friends today, I think I’ll invite them to lunch tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve been selected for the starting lineup in club activities, so also I needed to work harder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was how I thought about the future. I was full of motivation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;But for some reason, I felt a lingering pain in my chest.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">The next day at lunchtime. I wanted to invite Sasaki-kun and his friends to lunch, but I wasn’t in the mood to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason being that Ruri was absent from school today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I guess it’s dragging on after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sitting on the stairs leading to the rooftop, I was eating yakisoba bread I had bought at the store alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Yesterday, Ruri told me she hated me, and I thought I was over it…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, Kenji-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was sadly chewing on my yakisoba bread, I heard my name called from the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked down and saw Kiritani-sensei looking at me curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, what’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s my line. What’s going on here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m… well, I’m just having lunch alone…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Okay. I’m having lunch too, by the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei displayed a convenience store lunch box to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next he came up the stairs and sat down next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, do you always eat here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I usually eat on the roof.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Saying this, Kiritani-sensei showed me the key to the rooftop.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In principle, the rooftop was off-limits to students, but faculty members were allowed to use it only under special circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re okay with me using your rooftop for private use?’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s called an unspoken agreement. Other teachers also use it for relaxation.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei laughed happily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps it was because I had seen that movie, but I felt that his smile was somewhat similar to Nanase’s.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, why are you eating lunch here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… I’m just in the mood to eat here today in peace and quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I responded, Kiritani-sensei stared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt awkward for some reason and looked away from him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei asked in a worried voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Is he an esper? He’s so sensitive to other people’s feelings that I can’t help but think so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, a little bit…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. …If you don’t mind, could you tell me a little bit about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei asked discreetly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I told him that I hadn’t been able to talk to Ruri already, and he had a right to know how things ended between me and her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I told him everything I had said to Ruri and what she had said to me last night.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So that’s what happened…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Kiritani-sensei finished listening, he turned his face down and looked sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were not many teachers who would grieve like this for their students just because they had a hard time. At least among all the teachers I have met, Kiritani-sensei was the only one who cared this much about his students.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But that’s okay. I come to school and I’m doing my best in my club activities, and recently I made some friends… Kind of? Anyway, I’m enjoying school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve grown tremendously since the days when I was in a state of depression and this was all thanks to Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will continue to do my best in this way, as myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I declared to Kiritani-sensei, as if to tell him that I’m okay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was sure he would be pleased.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought so, but… he looked a little sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“When Nanase and I went to high school together, no matter what happened to us, she always tried to be herself. That made me want to live like her, too…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Kiritani-sensei started talking about Nanase.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was a little confused by him, but he continued in a gentle manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know this may be selfish of me, but I would like Kenji-kun to live like that too.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That… I do too. So every day, I work hard at club activities, talk to my classmates, and&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you sure you and Aima-san want to continue like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was at a bit of a loss for an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t like it either. …but there’s nothing I can do about it. She said she hated me, and rejected my existence…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you really think Aima-san hates Kenji-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“T-That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can’t say that I don’t think so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But at least I couldn’t believe that everything Ruri had said to me last night was true.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, will you listen to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I turned my head, he had a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was really not going to tell you this for Soma-san’s sake, but I’m going to tell you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Kiritani-sensei, what do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked him what he meant, he began to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the day of the high school entrance ceremony.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the day of the high school entrance ceremony, while he was greeting the students in his class, there were two students who were on his mind. It was me who was absent and the other was Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While Kiritani-sensei was greeting the students and his classmates were introducing themselves, Ruri was glancing at the seat next to hers &mdash; my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This continued even after the entrance ceremony was over.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Kiritani-sensei looked into the classroom after school, he found Ruri wiping the dust off my seat, which had not been used for a long time and was covered with dust.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014.jpeg" alt="" width="1356" height="1926" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3665" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014.jpeg 1356w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00014-1081x1536.jpeg 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1356px) 100vw, 1356px" /></p>
<p class="calibre3">And the day after Kiritani-sensei’s first visit to my house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How was Tanaka-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri came all the way to the staff room first thing in the morning to ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whatever it was, she happened to hear from another teacher that Kiritani-sensei was going to meet me the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since then, whenever Kiritani-sensei visited my house, Ruri would always ask how I was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every time he would reply, “he was fine,” or “he seemed to be enjoying playing games,” and Ruri would pat her chest in relief.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So she did that…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In response to my remark, Kiritani-sensei replied, “Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you think she really hates Kenji-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought seriously about his question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With what I heard from the Kudo siblings and what I just heard from Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri must have done a lot for me without my knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thought about it, there was only one answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think she hates me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But then, why did Ruri say she hated me…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s talk to Aima-san one more time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I was muttering my doubts, Kiritani-sensei tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…But I don’t think Ruri will talk to me anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Still, let’s do something about it and try your best to talk to her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei’s tone was soft but somewhat urgent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, why are you going this far…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s because, after seeing what happened to Kenji-kun and Aima-san, as a teacher I couldn’t just let you two go on like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You two are both very good students”, Kiritani-sensei continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This teacher was really a good teacher all the way around.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, Kenji-kun, let’s work a little harder.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Encouraged by Kiritani-sensei, I made up my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I decided to give it one more try.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. I’ll try to talk to Ruri one more time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I answered, Kiritani-sensei looked happy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All right. I’ve decided, let’s talk to Ruri the next time she comes to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei really has a heart for your students.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think so. There are many other teachers who do the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei was humble as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This may have been one of the reasons why I could trust him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I just want Kenji-kun and Soma-san to have no regrets.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So that… We won’t have regrets?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. I think I told you this once. On the day of my high school graduation I decided to stop my confession to Nanase and support her dream. But I don’t regret that choice at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei turned to me and smiled as he spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because it was a decision I made myself with Nanase in mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Can I say with such a clear expression that I don’t regret not confessing to the person I love? At least I don’t think I can.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was how much Kiritani-sensei really cared about Nanase-san.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I want Kenji-kun and Soma-san to make a choice that they won’t regret. That will surely lead you to live as yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei told me slowly and carefully, as if to indicate that it was important.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He then stood up with his lunch box, which had been left over a bit because of his talking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s all I wanted to say. Lunch break is almost over and I have to get back.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei… Thank you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This teacher has really helped me a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was why I really wanted to say something to Kiritani-sensei after hearing what he just said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Um, can I tell you something, Sensei…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“? What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei asked in a curious tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I want him to know that I am there for him&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sure that Kiritani-sensei will be able to see Nanase-san again!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The moment he heard my words, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She lives across the sea now, so it may be difficult, but I’m sure… that Kiritani-sensei will see her again!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said he had no regrets about not confessing to Nanase-san, and I believe he must be telling the truth. Besides, when we talked before, Kiritani-sensei didn’t seem to have any intention to meet with her in the future because it would disturb Nanase-san.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As his student, I want his love to be rewarded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because he is such a wonderful teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei smiled again after he thanked me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And that… was the coolest smile I’ve ever seen.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“So tired today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After the soccer team’s practice was over, I was walking home alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The tournament was coming up soon, so practice was getting pretty hard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was getting used to the club activities, but my muscles were still sore all over.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I got home, the front door was unlit and the living room was dark.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I then remembered that my father and mother both had to work late today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Shoot. I forgot to buy dinner.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At times like this, I had to go to a convenience store to buy one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Whatever. I’ll just go buy it now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as I was about to open the front door, the intercom rang.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“? Who would come here at this hour?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">With a question in my mind, I put my hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, I opened the door to find a person that I wasn’t expecting standing there.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Good evening. Kinu.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">A fresh voice. A person tall enough to look up at. A handsome face like a model.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My former best friend &mdash; Saitomiya Touya.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Touya, why…!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I came here in the afternoon, but no one answered. So I came back now… and this is a surprise.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya looked at my uniform carefully. Then he continued his story.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I never thought that Kinu was attending a high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I’ve just recently started attending. I stopped going to school during middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Heeh, I wonder who bullied you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said in a mocking manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And there were feelings that welled up deep in my chest, but I managed to suppress them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m the one who started it all in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m here to make fun of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I immediately replied, and Touya laughed in an amused manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m just kidding. I came here to tell you something.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you want to tell me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked, and he nodded. After all this time, what was it that Touya wanted to tell me?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was he boasting that he already got a regular spot in the “Teijo High School” soccer team or something?</p>
<p class="calibre3">With Touya’s ability, I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was thinking like that, unexpected words came out of Touya’s mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“I broke up with Ruri.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">I was so surprised that I could not speak immediately when Touya revealed it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You look surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well… Isn’t that expected?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Me and Touya have been through a lot, but I know from him that he has been in love with Ruri since they were in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I couldn’t believe that after a year or so, they broke up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought so, but then I heard even more shocking words from Touya’s mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I dumped that boring girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! You..!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I tried to get emotional, he tried to quiet me with his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t be so angry. Listen to what I have to say.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He smiled and continued his story.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She’s terrible, that girl. She doesn’t even look happy when she goes on a date with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Touya, stop it already.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve been going out with her for about a year now, and she won’t even hold my hand, let alone kiss me. That’s not a good girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Stop it already.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, I should never have gone out with that girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I told you to stop already!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I shouted, and finally Touya stopped talking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya… why are you saying that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said, barely managed to get it out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so sad that my best friend, no, my ex-best friend, who was the nicest and coolest person to anyone &mdash; was saying such horrible things.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, that’s because… I don’t like Ruri in the first place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Touya said something I didn’t understand, I asked him back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To this, Touya responded with a half smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll repeat it, I never liked Ruri in the first place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Then why did you confess to Ruri?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because I hate Kinu.””</p>
<p class="calibre3">The same words that he had said to me in middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But even after hearing such an answer, I still could not understand it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why would you want to go out with Ruri just because you hate me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are really obtuse. It’s harassment, harassment.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so shocked, and he put his hand on his forehead and added.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I actually knew that you liked her even before I asked you if you liked anyone.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Huh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was the first time I had heard that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, knowing that I had feelings for Ruri, did Touya have me help him and Ruri get together in middle school…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So I wanted to go out with Ruri, whom you like, and harass you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Did you really go out with her just to do that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked, Touya nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s right. That’s how much I hated Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He smiled at me.<br class="text-left" />
　<br class="text-left" />
I couldn’t tell what he was feeling now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But I broke up with her because I didn’t want that boring girl anymore. Kinu and I went to different high schools, and there was no point in harassing you anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You, stop talking like that&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was saying this, I suddenly realized something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately after, I stopped what I was about to say to Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, you can do whatever you want with Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was talking in a tone that said he was no longer interested in her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a statement that was hard to believe coming from the man who had been so incensed by my later confession to Ruri back in middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya, you…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Aww, she really was a boring girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He seemed to be a bit lonely like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, and you know, it wasn’t Ruri who told me about your confession to her in middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya spoke as if he had just remembered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! But you said you heard it from Ruri at that time…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s a lie, a lie. The truth is that a classmate happened to see your confession and told his friend, and I heard it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya said in a lighthearted manner, and in addition, he conveyed another message.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“While I’m at it, I am the reason why Ruri didn’t do anything for Kinu when you were going through a tough time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya was the reason… what do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked back, and he answered with a wicked smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I threatened Ruri a little. I told her that if she tried to help Kinu, she might end up in the same situation as Kinu. Then she got scared and stopped trying to help you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! Why did you do that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I just wanted to harass Kinu. That’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the end, he said it clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I realized something else and said nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This is all I wanted to tell you. Whether you confess to Ruri or go out with her from now on has nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When he finally told me that, he spun around and turned his back to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s that, then.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He walked away from me little by little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His back looked so lonely, somewhat similar to me when I was in a depressed mood.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I called his name, he turned around.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What? Is there something you want to say to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, there is.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I answered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go ahead. Cuss me out or whatever you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya stood there proudly, as if he would accept any words I had to say to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m sorry to say this, but the words I’m about to say are not abusive.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you, Touya.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I thanked him, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he chuckled and said</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You idiot. What are you thanking me for?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess you’re right.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I laughed a little too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You really are an idiot… and so am I.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya looked up at the darkening night sky and said sadly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he turned his back on me again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Farewell, Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, see you again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But there was no reply, and Touya left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was the only one left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…He’s too bad at lying.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were times when Touya was lying when he was talking to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When he was talking about dating Ruri in order to harass me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And when he talked about how he threatened Ruri so that she wouldn’t help me when I was being bullied, he grabbed his pants.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was an old habit of his when he lies.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In other words, he was going out with Ruri because he really liked her, and he threatened her because he liked her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If that was the case, then he must have lied about everything he said about Ruri, even though he said terrible things about her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Still, he went out of his way to tell me that they had broken up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Probably so that I could approach or confess to Ruri at any time in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After all, just like in the past, Touya remained kind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Well, he wasn’t lying when he said he hated me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had a feeling he had his own reasons for that too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come to my house to tell me that he and Ruri had broken up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Really, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thanked him again, turning to Touya, who was already gone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wish I could be best friends with him again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For some reason, I was sure we could work it out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though I have no evidence at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I felt it would be so strangely deep down.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">After telling Kinu everything. I ── Saitomiya Touyawa ── was walking alone in a residential area to go home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you… that idiot.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself as I remembered what Kinu had said to me earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve done a lot of terrible things to him….but he really is an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was thinking that, and suddenly I remembered something from the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was in elementary school, my father was constantly being transferred for work, and I inevitably kept changing schools.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was shy and didn’t talk much, so I wasn’t the type of person who could make friends.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, in my fourth elementary school I transferred to, I met Kinu and Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was shy and had trouble communicating with them, but they were kind enough to talk to me over and over again. Especially Ruri, who invited me to play with her many times.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think I had already fallen in love with her by then.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I began to envy Kinu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He is a childhood friend of Ruri and always made her smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I envied him and… gradually disliked &mdash; or rather, loathed &mdash; him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I like Ruri, but why are you always with her?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve selfishly arrived at that conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then one day. While I was waiting at the park to play with Ruri and the others, some boys who were my classmates from another class came to the park.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were famous for their bad reputations.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, we’re using this place. Get out of my way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I was alone, and one of the boys unleashed a relentless stream of words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“B-But… I’ve promised to play here too.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hah? I think you’re the one who recently transferred to this school, aren’t you? Don’t get carried away, stranger.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The boys were glaring at me. </p>
<p class="calibre3">I was scared and tried to run away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But at that moment, I suddenly heard a voice from behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t get cocky!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I looked and saw that Kinu was talking to the male student.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, the boy glared at Kinu and said</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji, it’s you again. It’s time for you to stop this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s our line. Don’t keep the park to yourself, you idiot.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Idiot…! I’m going to beat you to a pulp again today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Show me what you can do. Come!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu beckoned to him as if to provoke him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The gesture seemed to be very familiar to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do it, boys.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“””Oh!”””</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately after that, the boy who was talking with Kinu and me shouted out, and the other boys followed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, all the boys jumped on Kinu at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, a few minutes later. Kinu, who had been beaten to a pulp, was lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;He is so weak, what the!?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you okay, Kinu?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was worried about him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I called him by his nickname, but to be honest, at this point I had no choice but to call him that because Ruri was using it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I really didn’t want to call someone I didn’t like by his nickname.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry, don’t worry. It happens all the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu replied with a laugh as he got up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, are you always doing this kind of thing…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh. Because those guys always try to monopolize the park and it pisses me off.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But that doesn’t mean they have to beat you up every time…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought from the bottom of my heart that he must really be an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He should just leave those guys alone…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But you had other reasons for being here today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Kinu started to say that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he didn’t look at me, and as if it were a matter of course&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They were trying to hurt Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hearing Kinu’s words, I was a little puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you trying to help me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s natural. Me and Touya are, well… friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu said shyly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so embarrassed that I couldn’t think straight for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Me and Kinu-kun are friends?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, we’re not? I thought we were… but, are we not?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu turned his face down sadly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was covered in cuts and scratches on his arms, and to think that it was all for my sake&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">I found myself holding both of Kinu’s hands.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, me and Kinu-kun &mdash; no, me and Kinu are friends!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this moment, for the first time in my life, I voluntarily called him Kinu.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016.jpeg" alt="" width="1197" height="1701" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3667" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016.jpeg 1197w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016-721x1024.jpeg 721w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016-768x1091.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/00016-1081x1536.jpeg 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1197px) 100vw, 1197px" /></p>
<p class="calibre3">And I made an irreplaceable friend for the first time in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From then on, my days were full of life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I played around with Ruri and Kinu and had a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One day. I started to play soccer with Kinu, and it seemed I was suited to the sport.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu was also very good at passing the ball, and playing soccer with him was really great.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that the days would go on like this for a long time, and that the three of us would spend our days together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;But at the same time, an evil feeling started to creep into my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When the three of us are together, I can’t help but feel it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The special bond that exists between Ruri and Kinu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We had been together since childhood, and we had built a relationship that no one else could enter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still liked Ruri, but I couldn’t really break into the relationship those two had.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, although it was fun to be with them, it also became harder and harder to be with them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">These feelings gradually grew, and when I was in the third year of middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had reached my limit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought about breaking off our relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But more than that, I wanted to make Ruri my girlfriend, to make her my own.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I first asked Kinu if he liked someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If he mentioned Ruri’s name, I was going to step down peacefully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…No, it’s not fair to say it this way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be honest, when I asked the question, I was thinking that Kinu would not mention Ruri’s name because he was thinking of the three of us, including me. That was how much he cares about Ruri and me, and I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sure enough, Kinu told me that he didn’t like anyone, and I decided to use that as an excuse to make Ruri my girlfriend, no matter what.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I told Kinu that I liked Ruri and asked him to help me with my approach.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that since Kinu was so kind, he would not be able to approach or confess his feelings to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, I aggressively approached Ruri and even asked her out on a date.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every time we went on a date, she turned me down, but I told her indirectly that I liked her anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I confessed my love to her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but she turned me down at first.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She said, “I have someone else I like.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Someone she liked. Of course she liked Kinu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I wasn’t going to back down just because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I said to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think Kinu has anyone he likes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I asked Kinu and he said he didn’t have anyone he liked. And when I asked her to help me make things work with Ruri, he gladly accepted.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-Is that how it is…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was clearly shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She probably thought Kinu liked her a little too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t miss the wavering of her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is it okay for Ruri to remain in love with Kinu?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What does that mean…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I mean, you’ve been with him since you were kids and he still doesn’t like you, right? Then wouldn’t it be better if you went out with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What are you talking about, Touya-kun? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri looked as if she wasn’t buying it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Still, I didn’t back down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t care if we just go out on a trial basis. That’s how much I like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t want to even if you say that…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri stubbornly refused.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew that doing things the usual way was not going to get me anywhere. With that in mind, I decided to change my words a little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sure Kinu will be happy if Ruri and I go out with each other.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu would…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, I’m sure Kinu will be happy to see me and Ruri go out. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There, for the first time, Ruri showed a gesture of hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then she showed a determined look.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I understand. I’ll go out with Touya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus, Ruri and I became lovers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt happy, but I also felt a sense of emptiness, wondering if I could have such a relationship with Kinu involved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this is good.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I would just have Ruri fall in love with me little by little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A few days later, however, something unexpected happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu confessed his feelings to Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t think that Kinu would do such a thing after knowing how his best friend felt about her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri turned down his confession, but I was extremely impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that if I didn’t do something, he would take Ruri away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I attacked Kinu thoroughly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I just didn’t want to lose the person I love.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Ruri tried to help him, even though she knew his best friend liked Ruri and confessed to her, knowing that Kinu was at fault too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I threatened her a little the same way that I told Kinu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And so, as a result of my continued attacks on Kinu without anyone interrupting me, he stopped coming to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And at this time, I finally realized what I was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had done something irreversible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But it was already too late for anything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was thinking that, when Ruri told me that she wanted to break up with me, it was only natural. </p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I took advantage of Ruri’s kindness and continued seeing her for a long time without breaking up with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though we never held hands, never kissed, and for that matter, even though she didn’t seem to be enjoying herself when we were on dates. We kept dating.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I had given up on everything, I saw a movie called “Freedom.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I saw an actress named Nanase Rena in the movie, and I was moved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was the most lively actress in the movie, regardless of the role she played.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt that she was acting in a way that made me feel that she loved acting from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase-san was the complete opposite of me, and she was so vibrant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I wanted to live like her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After seeing the movie, I looked at the pamphlet and found this in her interview page.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Living life as you are is definitely the most enjoyable of any life!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Seeing those words, I thought about living my own life in my own way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I decided to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At least, I knew I couldn’t live my life as myself if I continued to date Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the day we went to the movie theater, I told Ruri that we were breaking up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri tried to tell me the same thing, but I had created this twisted relationship, so I thought it would be the least I could do to end it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Today, I told Kinu everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s start again from here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I lost everything, but I deserved it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have to accept my sins and start again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe I don’t even deserve it…</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that moment, I received a call on my phone unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I answered, it was from Matsunaga-san, the coach of the soccer team at Teijo High School, where I go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Touya! How long are you going to stay out of practice? You’ve got to be kidding me!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He suddenly shouted angrily. This guy was a kind person before he entered the school, but once I joined the club, his tone became rough. …Well, it’s not hard to see why the coach is so angry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because for the past month I haven’t been going to practice with the soccer team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reason was that while I practiced and played games at a strong school, my ability was not good enough at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was shocked because I had confidence in my abilities… but now I don’t have any such feelings anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry. I’m going to start tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The coach was surprised when I said simply, “R-Really? I’m counting on you!” And with that, he hung up the phone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ll work hard starting tomorrow. Soccer and everything. Give it all I’ve got.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I do that, I’m sure I’ll be able to live my life as myself someday.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">After Touya left, I went to the convenience store to buy dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya must have had mixed feelings about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I, Ruri, and Touya had been together for a long time. That was probably why Touya, who loved Ruri, had to suppress most of his feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Today, he took the trouble to come to me and tell me the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We talked about many things, but in the end, I think he wanted to tell me that there was no fault with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In fact, she was trying to save me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The other day, Ruri told me that she was the one who told Touya about my confession to her in middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She also said that she didn’t help me when I was being bullied by my classmates and that she didn’t even visit my house when I stopped going to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I know from what Touya told me that two of these things were lies.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And while she certainly didn’t visit me at my house, it may have been because she was threatened by Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I think about it, even more so than I had thought when I heard about it from Kiritani-sensei… I felt a little differently about Ruri hating me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What does Ruri really think about me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve been with her for so long that it’s probably the first time I’ve seriously thought about this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I think about it this way, I realize once again how much I love Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many things have happened, but no matter what, I have always loved Ruri as I have since I was a little kid.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I wish I could tell her that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I suddenly found myself muttering to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to tell her how I felt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had never felt this way before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And this was probably because of Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because he was prepared to tell me everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to tell the person I love that I love her too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t have time to buy dinner.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I changed direction and started running in the opposite direction of the convenience store.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, I was heading in the direction of Ruri’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had been with Ruri for more than ten years.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to see Ruri more than anything else right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With this thought in my mind, I continued to run without stopping.</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“Here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I kept running for a few minutes and in no time at all, I arrived at Ruri’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I came here in the heat of the moment, but she was absent from school today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What if she had a cold or something?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I calmed down a little and started to worry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so eager to see Ruri that I couldn’t even think of that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, I still wanted to meet and talk with Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I wanted to tell her how I feel.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just as I was thinking that, the front door of Ruri’s house suddenly opened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What appeared was, to my surprise, Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Huh? …Kinu.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“H-Hey. Ruri.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I greeted her anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She didn’t look like she was in bad shape or anything like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It doesn’t seem like she missed school because of a cold or anything like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah… um, bye.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri looked uncomfortable and tried to get back inside the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“W-Wait! I heard everything from Touya!</p>
<p class="calibre3">I shouted in a panic, and Ruri stopped dead in her tracks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…T-That was close.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so relieved, I then continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Should we talk at a different place?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I asked Ruri, she seemed at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri nodded in response.</p>

<p class="calibre3">We moved from her house to a nearby park.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was also the place where I confessed my feelings to her when we were in middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As I said before, I heard all about it from Touya. Ruri was doing it for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After we both sat down on the bench, Ruri mumbled that much as I explained.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was a little downcast and I couldn’t see her expression clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So… I want to thank you. You tried to help me in middle school, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Help you… I didn’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You did. At least that’s what I think.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hearing what Touya said, I honestly wanted to thank Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I wanted to punch myself for hating her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t. I’m really not that great of a person.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri’s eyes were downcast, and she returned the words sadly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then she went on with her story.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s my fault that Kinu got hurt so badly in middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked, surprised by Ruri’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I, you know, I liked Touya-kun as a friend, but as a man…I didn’t like him. I still chose to go out with him for selfish reasons.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri turned her face down and said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If I had refused his confession, Kinu wouldn’t have had to go through all that trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri finally raised her head and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her beautiful eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her thin shoulders and small hands were shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was how much pain Ruri has been going through for so long.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I see. Maybe that was why she has been avoiding me ever since we met in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I think again about that time in middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to help Ruri who was crying in front of me right now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wanted to put an end to the incident that had strained the relationship between the three of us.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then I came up with an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m pretty sure the fault lies with all three of us for what happened in middle school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The fault lies in all three of us…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah. First of all, it’s my fault that I confessed my feelings to Ruri, and it’s also my fault that Touya used my classmates to make me feel bad about it. It’s also bad that you accepted Touya’s confession even though I didn’t like him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I spoke in a casual manner like that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In other words, all three of us made a mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I finally finished speaking, Ruri hung her head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then I guess that means we’re done for.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri muttered in a weak voice, which I quickly denied.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She turned her head to me in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know our homeroom teacher, Kiritani-sensei? This is what he told me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There is no life without mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">People live their lives making mistakes from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the person who has made a mistake is also just being themself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Therefore, you don’t have to deny your mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It is okay to accept yourself as you are.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So even if you made a mistake, you and I can get back to having fun together again, if not right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see, you’re right!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri’s spirits lifted a little. Seeing her like this made me a little happy too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this was not why I met with her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, Ruri. Actually, there’s one thing I want to say to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…? What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ruri was a bit nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This embarrassing feeling I’m having right now is also wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had made my best friend sad and destroyed the relationship between the three of us because of this.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I must be a dangerous human for having such feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Still, I want to accept that I’m wrong and tell Ruri about these feelings of mine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For Touya’s sake, who made up his mind and told me everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For my own sake, who decided to live my life as myself.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“I like you, Ruri!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">And I told her my wrong and shameful thoughts.</p>
