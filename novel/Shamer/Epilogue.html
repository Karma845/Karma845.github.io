<h1 class="calibre1">Epilogue</h1><div class="text-left">
				<p class="calibre3">About three months had passed since Kenji-un had started attending Seiran High School.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With a chilly autumn breeze blowing, I &mdash; Kiritani Kakeru &mdash; was standing in front of the school gate for uniform and tardy check duty.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good morning, Sensei.” “Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two boys greeted me, and I did the same in return.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was sure that those two were on the soccer team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The soccer team was wiping out the most recent tournament with tremendous momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seiran High School was not known as a sports school and its athletic teams were generally not strong, but this year’s soccer team seemed to be an exception.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of the reasons for this was Kenji-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kenji-kun’s versatile passing plays tricks on the opponents, and a sophomore striker named Kudo-kun scores the final goals. They seem to win every time with this pattern.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps because of his success, Kenji-kun has caught the attention of the coach of a university that has produced professional players.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kenji-kun, you must be working really hard. That’s really great.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei, good morning.” “Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">This time, I was greeted by a couple-like pair, and I greeted them back with a “Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kenji-kun himself told me this, but about two months ago he confessed his feelings to Aima-san. I know he didn’t really want to talk about his confession, but he made a special effort to tell me because in his words, “I had helped him so much.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the result was&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre3">It was “on hold.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Hearing his answer, Kenji-kun decided to wait for now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But they were going to school together, and I think they were probably back to their original friendship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, Kenji-kun’s best friend… Saitomiya-kun, right? Kenji-kun seemed to have gradually restored his relationship with him as well, and now they even go to each other’s games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I heard that there were some differences between Saitomiya-kun and Aima-san, but Kenji-kun seemed to have worked hard to improve that as well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thanks to his efforts, Kenji-kun was happy to find that they were still able to hang out with each other from time to time, just like in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kenji-kun said it was all thanks to me, but I think it was because he has accepted the mistakes he made in the past and is now living his life to the fullest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There is no life without mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In other words, we all make mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So if you have made a mistake once or twice in your life and are feeling depressed, please don’t worry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everyone else is not so different from you.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was talking with Kenji-kun, he was jokingly calling himself a harmful human, but when I think about it, maybe we are all harmful humans.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To borrow Kenji-kun’s words, when you make a mistake in life, the most important thing is to have the courage to admit that you are a harmful person.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then you can move forward and start over, little by little.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I am sure that you will be able to live your own life like Kenji-kun has.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei is on duty today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, I hear a familiar voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I look over and see Kenji-kun standing there. Aima-san was standing next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He looked somewhat confident, and there was no sign of the boy he used to be when he was in his shut-in state.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I greeted Kenji-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He looked a little happy this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good morning! Kiritani-sensei!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He greeted me with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kenji-kun’s smile was so beautiful that I could feel that he was enjoying life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And in response, I took that happiness he felt as if it were my own.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This has been the story of one harmful person, who had accepted his wrong self, confronted his helpless, deplorable feelings, and is now continuing his life to the fullest.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">Today, Seiran High School’s soccer team had a tournament match.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After watching the soccer team’s game, in which Kinu participated, I went home with Kinu and Touya, who had also come to watch the game, and immediately changed into my casual clothes. By the way, Seiran High School won the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu was amazing today.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was passing the ball so fast to Kudo-senpai. I couldn’t catch up with my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was so excited, I received a MINE from Maki-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It said, “Let’s play a game now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was the manager of the soccer team, but I didn’t stop gaming.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said, “Okay,” to Maki-chan, and turned on the game.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then &mdash; I turned on the voice changer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, I don’t need this anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Inadvertently, I tried to remove the voice changer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Uhh, I kinda want to play around with it a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then I turned on the voice changer and spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey there. My name is Marumaru.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">My voice had been changed to a nice male voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was Marumaru’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was in the third year of middle school. After Kinu stopped coming to school, I wanted to help him somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But when I went to his house to visit him in person, I couldn’t find the courage to press the intercom, and I was wondering what to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was at that time when I happened to meet Kinu’s mother at a supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kinu’s mother was worried about her son and told me that he had recently started playing games and using social networking services all day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I secretly asked Kinu’s mother to give me his account so that I could contact him through games.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I sent him a lot of messages and managed to set up an appointment to play a game together, but I was worried that maybe he would recognize me by my voice when we were playing games and having a conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I desperately searched for a good voice changer and bought one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I used it and I became “Marumaru”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the biggest lie I have ever told Kinu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu would be amazed if he knew.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">…but I wasn’t going to reveal it yet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have made Kinu wait for my answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t forgive myself for hurting Kinu and Touya because of my half-heartedness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But if the day comes when I can forgive myself and become a girl worthy of Kinu…</p>

<p class="calibre3">Then&mdash;this time, I will confess my feelings to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I might even tell him about “Marumaru” as a bonus.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I tried to save the person I love, even with a big lie, and that makes me &mdash; a harmful human.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A harmful person who accepted her wrong self and expressed her feelings in a helpless and pathetic way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the story of two such harmful people who would one day be together.</p>
