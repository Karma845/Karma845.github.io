<h3>Chapter 32 &#8211; I&#039;ve Always Wanted to Go There </h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phone store they were looking for was a short walk from the station, and not only Himeko, but Haruki also had the same model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was nervous about going into a store for the first time, and was very confused by all the new things, words, and plans he had never heard before. He was in a state of complete panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, umm, Haruki?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, yes. Well, this one is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was so full of himself that Haruki was hesitant to make fun of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who always shows off her unorthodox appearance, is an excellent student and explains the shopkeeper&#8217;s words in an easy-to-understand manner at Hayato&#8217;s request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an hour and a half in the store, Hayato managed to get his hands on a smartphone, although he was completely taken care of by Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Haruki, I couldn&#8217;t have done it alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. So, you&#8217;re happy with the same as mine after all? I had other brands in my mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if we had matching ones?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato, you want matching ones!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know, if I have any questions about how to use it, I could just ask you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes. That&#8217;s right. But wouldn&#8217;t it be better if it was the same as Hime-chan&#8217;s?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? Because Himeko is my sister? It&#8217;s kind of awkward to ask.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mou~, I don&#8217;t really understand that feeling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They walked around the city, talking like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s goal was to choose a phone for Hayato. Now that they&#8217;ve done that, there&#8217;s nothing more to do here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―But it would be a shame to just leave and go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a common thought between Hayato and Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially for Hayato, it was his first visit to a big city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concrete buildings instead of greenery, drink vending machines instead of unmanned vegetable stands, traffic lights and crosswalks that used to be only one in the vicinity of Tsukinose. I was a complete up-and-comer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was overwhelmed by the scenery around him, but when he looked next to him, he noticed that Haruki seemed to be having a hard time walking. When he looked at her feet, he saw that she was wearing high heeled mule sandals that she had taken down for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, sorry, am I walking too fast? You&#8217;re not used to wearing those, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, mules? That&#8217;s not really the case though?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, but you looked like you were having trouble walking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki looked troubled and embarrassed when he pointed this out. Hayato, who had assumed that the footwear would not fit, made a puzzled face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki hesitated for a moment, then stretched a little, put her mouth close to Hayato&#8217;s ear, and whispered in a pitiful voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My skirt is too short, you know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was an unexpected comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Haruki&#8217;s figure, it was indeed shorter than her usual uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the perfect length to bring out Haruki&#8217;s innocence, not too long and not too short, just above the kneecaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is not too short. Even in school uniforms, girls who wear skirts in this particular length are often common to be seen, and Himeko has several dresses in this length as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki continued to speak, as if seeking understanding or sympathy from Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you see, the fabric is thin and unreliable, and it&#8217;s very soggy around the thighs. Also, if there&#8217;s a breeze or something, it might get rolled up, and if you try to pick up something that&#8217;s fallen on the ground, you&#8217;ll see it if you&#8217;re not careful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa, that&#8217;s tough&#8230; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki said this with a strange look on her face, but Hayato couldn&#8217;t really feel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to realize that miniskirts are a corrective device for female power. Any girl who wears a short one looks like she&#8217;s practicing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, they do. I mean, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s unfair that I&#8217;m the only one who has to feel this way? Why don&#8217;t you wear it, Hayato? You should know what I&#8217;m going through!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, don&#8217;t be absurd. I wouldn&#8217;t look good in it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think so? Hayato is Hime-chan&#8217;s older brother, so I&#8217;m sure it will look good on you. Rather, the person who was responsible for this&#8230;! Now I understand how Hime-chan felt yesterday!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t do that, your eyes are looking serious!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ihihihi~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they were talking, Hayato slowed down and looked around to see if he could find anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hayato&#8217;s eyesight was constantly getting bombarded with stores, advertisements, and billboards, making him feel like he was spinning in circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? Hayato, is there anywhere else you want to go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah&#8230; but there are so many stores and such&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For that, this is where your phone comes in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s true!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You put in the name of the store and the name of the city and you get―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, there it is! Amazing! Ermm―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s eyes narrowed as she watched Hayato&#8217;s innocent joy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about a ten-minute walk from the station, on the outskirts of the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With five floors above ground and one below, and a total floor space of over 1,000 square meters, it was one of the largest hundred-yen stores in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So big&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s big, but this is even bigger than I imagined.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this Haruki&#8217;s first time too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve always been a recluse at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, Hayato!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato looked at Haruki with a slightly annoyed smile on his face and, not wanting to be outdone, forcefully pulled her hand to enter the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a little embarrassed and nervous, but as soon as he stepped into the store, he was stunned by the overwhelming amount of goods on display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information board in front of them showed that they dealt in a wide variety of products, from daily necessities such as food, tableware, cosmetics, hygiene products and bath products to hobbies and DIY products such as cars, gardening, toys, party goods, interior designs and tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can buy all of this for 100 yen? What the hell is going on here!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, look at the food section.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh&#8230; well, the sale stuff at the supermarket is cheaper.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu, that&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While having this exchange, Hayato was drawn to something that caught his interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time for him to see so many products lined up in a row, and he was filled with a sense of mission to buy something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuuhh~, I want to buy some dishes. I want to buy new ones. I want to have a variety of dishes for different purposes. Oh, damn! Even if I replace everything, I&#8217;ll only need 3,000 yen&#8230; No, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you going to do with the one you&#8217;re using now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;re already there, so there&#8217;s no need to buy any more I guess.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then what about that storage area over there?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ehh, what&#8217;s all this stuff, all these different kinds? I feel a little compelled to clean up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it wasn&#8217;t only Hayato who was unnecessarily stimulated to buy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, Haruki, do you really need that ball of moss!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know that better than anyone! But it&#8217;s whispering to me to take it home!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chill out, what are you even going to use it for? Are you going to make a moss terrarium out of it!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it, Hayato. I&#8217;m just buying it because I want to!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come to your senses, Haruki!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was also trying to loosen her purse strings as she was attracted to various interesting things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it bluntly, the two of them were just getting carried away and playing with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They walked around the sales floor, each with their own interests, just as they used to do when they were looking for insects and wildflowers in the countryside. They ran up the escalator and explored the forest of shelves, just as they had done when they ran around in the fields and mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn&#8217;t have a purpose, they just stayed together and enjoyed each other&#8217;s company. It was so much fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Haruki was a girl, she was still Hayato&#8217;s best friend, and that was all that mattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I ended up being too lost to buy anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, Hayato, you&#8217;ve always been like that, haven&#8217;t you? When we went to buy sweets at Murao&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s, we couldn&#8217;t even decide.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whenever I couldn&#8217;t make up my mind, I usually got ramune and ice cream.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I miss those days. At the time―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki had a nostalgic, yet sad expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato felt his chest tighten as he witnessed an emotion she rarely showed in public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Gukyuu~ [TLN: Probably sfx for stomach growl]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―ki&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, ahaha~, it seems that you&#8217;re hungry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I guess I am. It&#8217;s already around one o&#8217;clock, no wonder. Do you want to go somewhere to eat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, in that case, I&#8217;ve got somewhere in mind we should go to!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he turned around, Haruki had the same mischievous smile on her face as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bothered Hayato even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking up at the city sky, he saw not mountains, but inorganic buildings.</span></p>
