<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Unfamiliarity</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still lots of things that I’ve yet to get used to in my new school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in Tsukinose, I don’t see any tractors on my way to school, nor do I see deer or wild boar in the school yard. Also, the classrooms here are full.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same in gym class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I went there for the ball!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Lies! You can make it in time!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[To be caught in a feint, how funny!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tch!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we were playing various ball games jointly with the neighboring class in groups by gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, my group was playing soccer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My physical ability, trained by working in the fields while I was in the countryside, was outstanding compared to my classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also surprised my classmates with all kinds of feints and techniques.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My classmates warmly welcomed me with all kinds of laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good work, Kirishima. What the heck, you’re good and kind of awesome!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh come on, today was my first time playing soccer, Mori. There weren’t enough people to play ball games when I was in Tsukinose.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahaha, I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. What was that sound?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a loud cheer came from the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the space of the gym was limited, all groups can’t play at once. So half of us have to watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the people who were supposed to be watching seemed to be gathering to the gym. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was strongly piqued as I wondered what on Earth attracted people more than those who were looking at festival floats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, the goddess of victory has descended.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The goddess of victory?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mori urged me to go to the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was like a goddess flying mid-air. But in my eyes, I only saw a monkey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why is she there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She was floating for too long, are you sure she’s not flying?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pass the ball to Nikaido-san as much as you can!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, there’re always at least three people who mark her, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the girls basketball game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With one girl at the center of the game, the rapid offensive and defensive changes will make your hands sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She flew around the court with the ball in all directions, never settling in one place</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like a monkey jumping from tree to tree, she toyed with her classmates using her inhuman leg strength and stamina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interesting thing about this game was that Haruki was not the only one who stood out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the cheers coming from the crowd, I concluded that Haruki’s enemy was our school’s women basketball team. Even though Haruki’s performance stood out, the skill of the enemy’s teamplay was outstanding. They’re able to hold off Haruki and make the game a back-and-forth affair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a match that I couldn’t help but be fascinated by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a strong sense of deja vu about this game</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Fascinating, that girl’s playing)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki has always had a habit of not only playing games, but also jumping into a river, jumping over a fence, or swinging a stick she picked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She still puts up a cool face even when the enemy team looks exhausted. It’s a great way to make sure she’s getting the most of her team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She involuntarily wrinkled her eyebrows, and she breathed out because of the strangeness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha… I knew that Nikaido-san would be amazing, Kirishima.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I do agree with you, Mori]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Basketball’s all good, but ‘that’ thing’s awesome.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[‘That’?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you looked at Mori’s face, you’ll see that he had a tight and disheveled look on his face</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shifted my gaze for a moment, and I saw a lot of boys with the same expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you followed their gazes, you’d understand what Mori’s talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[EH?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Isn’t that great?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, Uhm, I mean, that…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Haruki’s breast. Her boobs. They weren’t particularly large compared to those around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her athleticism was unrivaled as she flew around the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They swayed vertically with a bang and went horizontally with a shake. Sometimes, when she feinted with the ball, it made a big arc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What an art.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mori whispered admiringly, and I gulped as if agreeing with him</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The size of Hauki’s body was standard or slightly below, but her supple and healthy movements were enough to make me conscious of the opposite sex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(OI OI! You can’t see her like that, it’s Haruki!!!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I desperately tell myself that in my head, but sadly, I am also an adolescent boy, and once I am aware of it, I can’t help but glance at her… Trying to pay attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[――]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Urgh!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Haruki decided to shoot and noticed my gaze. For a moment, I can hear her saying [How is it?] with a smile. The timing was too perfect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Did she notice my gaze? She didn’t, right???)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conflicting thoughts were running through my head, and my face was getting hotter and hotter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t stay here any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where are you going, Kirishima?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah you know, I’m not used to crowds.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, I see. What a waste.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahahaha&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving the gymnasium flatteringly, I felt like my head seemed to be boiled, partly because of the heat inside it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I slid my head under the faucet and twisted the stopper, my head cooled down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cheers as usual, mixed with the sound of water, hit my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It stimulated some kind of irritation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[AH, CRAP!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was certain that I was being swayed by Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued to cover myself with water in desperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed that there are still many things that I’m not used to.</span></p>
