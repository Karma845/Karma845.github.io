<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; Grumble (Softly) </h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the crowd of people, there were a number of unusual things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relatively huge video camera, a microphone to collect the actors’ voices, and two large vans loaded with other equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the area of the said equipment― a pair of men and women were acting out a friendly scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how you look at it, they were filming some kind of a drama or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t they filming ‘Ten Years of Solitude’?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh man, it’s Mao Takura, she looks so young. No matter how you look at her, it doesn’t look like she’s in her late twenties.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard her personal life is pretty messed up too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that one’s forgiven. She was deceived.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was an elegant actress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s almost the same age as Hayato’s parents, and yet her beauty and sex appeal doesn’t show any signs of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people around them said various kinds of interests about her: envy, admiration, astonishment, and jealousy. They were not all praises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was a sense of presence that made it understandable that it would attract so much attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Hmm? I’m pretty sure that was&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the actress from the drama that Himeko had been watching before she’d left home this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so popular that it was even recommended by his classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was convinced that she was indeed that attractive just like everyone else&#8217;s reaction, but for some reason, he felt a strange sense of some sort, like a déjà vu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Haruki’s appearance was unusual when she saw the actress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face looked pale, and she was desperately biting her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her shoulders were also shaking as if she was trying to hold something back, and her nails were digging into Hayato’s hands, causing them to bleed a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on her face was clearly not normal. The mixture of her emotions is on the verge of breaking down. But Hayato doesn’t know why she’s like this at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“―!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruki!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if she couldn’t take it anymore, she let go of Hayato’s hand and turned on her heel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned her face down, clicked her mules on the ground, and walked fast with her shoulders and elbows hunched. Hayato chased after Haruki with a troubled look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From another person’s perspective, it looked like Hayato was desperately chasing after her for making her angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to Hayato, it looked like she was trying to hold back her tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He doesn’t know what he’ll say to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean he would just leave her alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―She was being stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the Haruki that Hayato saw right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimicry, a good child, acting, an only child, a living room with no sense of life. Tons of information flashed in Hayato’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something seems to be connecting them together, but yet it doesn’t because there’s something crucial that’s missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there’s one thing that was certain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I can’t leave Haruki alone right now&#8230;!!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He chased after Haruki, who was about to disappear in the crowd, trying desperately not to lose sight of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a distance that can be reached by just reaching out. But there’s also a distance that separates them apart. It makes him feel a little frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa there!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a spur of the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato took Haruki’s hand when she tripped over her foot and saved her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki turned an indescribable face and gently looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
They both don’t know what to say to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was just a coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hayato knew that he shouldn’t ever let go of her hand again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;If we walk along the tracks here, will we be able to reach home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, how about it? I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, let’s find out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hayato?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big city. With the main road running next to a private railway line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the countryside roads, many structures line up like a lush white clover. They both walked along the endless road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awkward air from earlier still lingered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki’s face was one of stifled emotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was pulling the hand of such a childhood friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the other perspective, they look like two people who just made up after a fight. It’s a wonderful sight that you don’t see too often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hayato felt something terribly nostalgic about this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230;Wasn’t this how it was when we first met before?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was too long ago that he doesn’t even know when it was anymore. He was just starting to remember it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, Haruki was a child who never smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She usually doesn’t mingle with anyone else. She mostly holds her knees and makes an expressionless face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard, it’s painful, it hurts, she hates that. She forces herself to push those feelings down and yet, it feels like she’s waiting for something, selfishly despairing― and yet, she’s still stubborn and determined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato didn’t like to see Haruki like that, and so, he pulled her away and got her from her grip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Haruki right now looks like that kind of Haruki&#8230; it was seemingly visible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re well aware that things are different than they used to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter how much they don’t like this situation, neither of them is backing out from it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, they realized that nothing had changed. They finally noticed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hayato, you’ve always been pushy, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Haruki’s voice was tinged with nostalgia as she muttered to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s big and craggy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I used to help out in the fields after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I used to be taller than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Were you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yup!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t remember.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I remember it though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki put a lot of effort in holding the hand she held tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was like this when we first met.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki smiled weakly. It was so fragile that it could have been blown away by the wind. Even though her heart has been crying for a long time, she won’t even cry, even if she had to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato couldn’t find any words to say to Haruki and could only grit his teeth. He wanted to tell her that he’s here for her, so he squeezed her hand back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Then, Haruki lined up next to Hayato and started walking again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
This time, instead of Hayato pulling her hand, he walked shoulder to shoulder with Haruki, who moved her legs out of her own volition, just like in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter what they do, it will never be the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they line up together, there will be a one-head difference in height.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hands they were holding went around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
The dress she’s wearing is a stylish white summer dress that can never be covered in mud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
It was something that had changed in the seven years that had separated Hayato and Haruki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Even so, the hands they held together, unchanged from that time, conveyed the trust that there was indeed something that remained unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Haruki called out Hayato’s name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Hayato.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just one little complaint, if you don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I live in that house all by myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
It was disguised as an extension of their casual conversation. Trying to play it off the same as always.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Suddenly, a friendly-looking father and son walked up in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Hand in hand, and an eco-bag on the free side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
When Haruki saw this, she stopped in her tracks. Her expression becomes cloudy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
The voice she squeezed out couldn’t hide the trembling that she felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be a good girl and wait.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
It was a simple sentence that contained many different feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
Those were the words Haruki could say at best right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
The sound of a car’s engine drowned out the words as she finally managed to say something on her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early summer sun was slanting to the west, casting the shadows of buildings on the two of them.</span></p>
