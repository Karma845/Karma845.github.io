<h1>Chapter 8 - Events on a Snowy Day </h1>


<p>What do you need to study?</p>
<p>A calm environment.</p>
<p>Gentle background music.</p>
<p>And, of course, glucose, which is essential for your brain to function.</p>

<p>So, it was Sunday.</p>
<p>I came to my favorite coffee shop to study.</p>
<p>The name of the shop is Hoshimiya Coffee.</p>

<p>The interior is unified with an antique style and has a tranquil atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the table, there are reference books, coffee, and pancakes.</p>
<p>Usually, it’s an environment where I can concentrate without any complaints, but…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>(I can’t get into my rhythm.)</p>

<p>Ever since the night that I had a call with Chifuyu a few days ago, I have not been able to concentrate.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about Tomori.</p>
<p>Though I haven’t checked her secret account since that night.</p>

<p>(Maybe it won’t bother me after a while.)</p>

<p>[That’s why no matter how much I like K-kun, I won’t confess my feelings first.]</p>

<p>Tomori declared that on her secret account before.</p>
<p>If those words are true, a connection between us won’t be formed unless I take action.</p>
<p>Just as I thought something like that, the doorbell of the coffee shop rang.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>“Huh?!”</p>

<p>Exactly two seconds later, a soprano voice that I recognized all too well resounded.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but glance towards the door and held myself back.</p>
<p>Three seconds later, the doorbell rang again.</p>

<p>It seemed like the owner of the voice had left without taking a seat.</p>

<p>“…This is bad.”</p>

<p>Just hearing that one voice dealt a mortal wound to my concentration.</p>

<p>“Hey, wasn’t the girl who just came in so cute?”</p>
<p>“Ah yeah, she’s pretty cute. Is she on Instagram? I should follow her.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to invite her to hang out through DM or something like that? You don’t stand a chance. If she’s that cute, she probably has a boyfriend.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>“Ugh, well, that’s probably true… But why did she suddenly leave?”</p>

<p>I overheard a conversation between a male and a female college student inside the cafe.</p>
<p>Probably, I assume, the reason she left was because of me.</p>
<p>As I tapped on my smartphone, I looked at tomochan’s secret account for the first time in a few days. And I read:</p>

<p>《Why did I get so surprised?》</p>
<p>《I got scared and ran away…》</p>
<p>《Today’s outfit is too casual to show K-kun!》</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori was screaming for help on SNS.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“It seems like it was just a coincidence after all.”</p>

<p>I thought I was being followed again, but it seems that wasn’t the case.</p>

<p>However, it’s quite convenient.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, Tomori won’t return to the coffee shop if this was the case.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>But, 15 minutes later…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>A new tweet appeared on the secret account.</p>

<p>《Candidate ①… A boyish coordinate by combining a shirt and shorts.》</p>

<p>It was a mirror selfie using such a caption and a full-body mirror.</p>
<p>She skillfully hid her face with the smartphone, but there was no mistake, it was Tomori in her shorts.</p>

<p>(Could it be that she went home and changed her clothes?)</p>

<p>Moreover, the tweet included hashtags like</p>
<p>#PleaseSpread</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>#Don’tKnowWhatToWear</p>
<p>#ChooseAGoodOutfitToMeetSomeoneYouLike.</p>

<p>I see, she intends to gather opinions on the internet.</p>

<p>(That way, she can objectively choose her outfit.)</p>

<p>As expected of the model student, it’s a well-thought-out strategy.</p>

<p>《Candidate ②… The Virgin Killing Sweater C-chan gave me last Halloween, designed to eliminate any innocent boy. A deadly exposure coordination that puts everything on one blow!》</p>
<p>(TN: A halter-top or turtle-necked sweater that is exposed on the back or side. Backless or side-less.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>…Please, no.</p>

<p>Rather than using her brain, it seemed that her thoughts were completely glitched.</p>
<p>There’s no way anyone would choose something this ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Does her IQ drop when it comes to love…?”</p>

<p>Hoshimiya Coffee is my oasis.</p>
<p>If I end up in such an embarrassing situation, sitting next to a classmate dressed like this, I won’t be able to come back to this place.</p>

<p>《Candidate ③… A safe and conservative outfit. A slightly uninteresting coordinate.》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>I unintentionally held my breath.</p>
<p>A white summer knit that suits the early summer, paired with a casual black skirt.</p>
<p>And a slightly smaller and adorable beret.</p>

<p>Certainly, it may lack the excitement of an exposure coordinate, but sometimes the conventional choice is the one that takes the high road.</p>

<p>(Option 1 is also tempting, but Option 3 suits her the best.)</p>

<p>Or rather, unexpectedly…</p>
<p>She was so cute that I found myself wanting to see her directly with my own eyes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>《These are the three candidates! Please give a ‘like’ to the outfit you like the most!》</p>

<p>Alright, Option 3 is nice.</p>
<p>I hope someone gives a ‘like’ to Option 3, but it’s not receiving any likes.</p>

<p>Tomochan’s account has zero followers.</p>
<p>No matter how cute the uploaded photos are, it’s difficult to get likes.</p>

<p>(Well, for me, it’s better that way.)</p>

<p>If there are no likes, Tomori won’t come here.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>But I can’t help but imagine it.</p>
<p>Clothes scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>A classmate who takes mirror selfies changes outfits and earnestly uploads the images.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori. Nervously hopes for likes, anxiously staring at her smartphone, afraid that nobody will find her in the sea of social media…</p>

<p>“…Today is the last time.”</p>

<p>Muttering to myself, I use my Otaku account to give a ‘like’ to Option 3.</p>

<p>(She shouldn’t be able to figure out my true identity here.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>It’s account I used to talk about anime impressions in tweets and doesn’t reveal any personal information.</p>
<p>[Thank you for the like!] Tomochan dutifully expresses her gratitude.</p>

<p>This coffee shop must be close to Tomori’s house, I suppose.</p>
<p>Because five minutes later, Tomori enters the cafe again.</p>

<p>(She made an effort to choose her clothes, so I should compliment her if she starts a conversation.)</p>

<p>” … “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span>

<p>However, as I pretend not to notice, I observe her behavior.</p>

<p>Tomori takes a seat away from me.</p>
<p>Then, saying, [Alright, let’s study!]. She opens her reference book and notebook.</p>
<p>But occasionally, she glances in my direction, looking hesitant.</p>

<p>《…I can’t do it. I’m so nervous, I feel like I’ll die. It’s impossible for me to initiate a conversation on a day off.》</p>

<p>She expresses her torment on her secret account.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span>

<p>《But… I want to be praised… I want him to compliment the clothes I carefully chose…》</p>

<p>With that determination, she succumbs to the approval-seeking monster.</p>

<p>《Initiating a conversation from my side would be too forced, so…》</p>
<p>《Let’s do a charm spell! Look at me, K-kun! I’ll say ‘I love you’ in my heart a lot of times!》</p>

<p>What’s with that girlish spell?</p>
<p>Even my face is starting to feel hot.</p>
<p>I want to believe it’s just a problem with the air conditioning, but most likely, it’s because of that intense secret account girl’s love toward me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span>

<p>(Ah, seriously…)</p>

<p>But, her heart is too sunshiny. (日心々しすぎる)</p>
<p>Her clumsy appearance is very far from the [Everyone’s friend] image known as Tomori, and I couldn’t just leave her be.</p>

<p>(Besides, today might be my only chance.)</p>

<p>The opportunity to repay the favor from that day, a year and a half ago, when Tomori saved me…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“What are you doing, Class President?”</p>

<p>While staring at my phone and whispering [I love you, I love you, I love you] in my heart, I was suddenly spoken to.</p>
<p>Surprised, I lifted my face, and there was Kagisaka-kun.</p>

<p>Yay! My prayers were answered!</p>
<p>But I tried to appear as natural as possible and said,</p>

<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Hoshimiya Coffee is my favorite place.”</p>
<p>“Really? As expected, you’re still stalking me, this is wh——”</p>
<p>“What were you doing? You had a serious expression while looking at your phone. Were you chatting with your boyfriend?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“I don’t have a boyfriend!”</p>
<p>“Then what were you doing?”</p>
<p>“Um, well…”</p>

<p>I couldn’t exactly mention the charm spell, so to hide my uneasiness, I looked down and said,</p>

<p>“… It’s none of your business, right?”</p>

<p>Ah, I did it again.</p>
<p>Even though I don’t have to worry about other classmates now, why do I still snap at him?</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun must be getting fed up and will probably return to his seat.</p>

<p>“Hey, now that we’ve met, why don’t we study together?”</p>
<p>“Huh!?”</p>
<p>“The seat across, is it empty?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“Wait! I haven’t agreed yet—”</p>
<p>“And by the way, that outfit looks cute. It suits you well, Tomori.”</p>
<p>“…!?”</p>

<p>I could only manage to respond with […Of course] to that unexpected attack.</p>
<p>And then, Kagisaka-kun brings his belongings and sits in the opposite seat.</p>

<p>(…It’s a dream come true.)</p>

<p>After receiving compliments on my outfit on a day off, we started studying together.</p>
<p>To think that the scenario I had fantasized about multiple times became a reality…</p>

<p>“See, I told you she had a boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“Are they high school students? Damn, I’m envious. I wish I could have had that kind of high school experience too.”</p>

<p>I overheard a quiet conversation between a man and a woman in the cafe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>To avoid feeling too embarrassed by staying silent, I decided to initiate a conversation with Kagisaka-kun.</p>

<p>“You’re eating something unusually cute.”</p>
<p>“It’s common for guys to eat pancakes these days. But anyway, did you come here to study or not?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah, but I also wanted some time to think.”</p>
<p>“Did someone consult you again?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. Don’t you remember? Takakura-san from our class. After she asked me for love advice, she started dating a college student. But it seems they didn’t get along once they actually started dating.”</p>
<p>“So they broke up. It’s a selfish story.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“That’s too harsh. Aren’t you the one that is being selfish today? Why did you disrupt me and suddenly suggest studying together?”</p>
<p>“Just a whim.”</p>

<p>With a curt response, Kagisaka-kun starts working on the problem set.</p>
<p>He’s dressed in a sleek coordinate: a black jacket, a crisp white shirt, and slim pants. Perhaps due to his composed attire or the fact that I’m not used to seeing him in anything other than his school uniform, he appears even more mature than usual.</p>

<p>《So precious~! K-kun looks so cool in his casual clothes!》</p>
<p>《I secretly want to record this!》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>《It’s impossible, studying in this situation is impossible!》</p>

<p>Trying to calm myself down even a little, I pour out my thoughts on my secret account.</p>
<p>Not a single piece of the study material enters my head.</p>
<p>In contrast, Kagisaka-kun is making progress with the problem set… sigh.</p>

<p>(…Really, at least be a bit conscious of me. It feels like I’m the only one who cares about this.)</p>

<p>On a day off, sitting next to a girl alone, it would be nice if he felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about him this whole time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>I wonder if he would be surprised if I held his hand… No, that’s definitely impossible.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to hold hands, and unfortunately, I don’t have the courage for that.</p>
<p>I need to try a different approach… Ah, I got an idea.</p>

<p>“Hey, want to have some?”</p>

<p>I carefully timed it as Kagisaka-kun finished the problem set, offering him a slice of cake with a fork.</p>
<p>Just like a close couple.</p>

<p>“Yes? What’s this all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“You finished the problem set, right? So I thought I’d give you a reward.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“You’re just trying to make fun of me…”</p>
<p>“Of course. I thought I’d take this opportunity to relieve my pent-up frustrations. I want to see your face stained with embarrassment.”</p>

<p>Knowing Kagisaka-kun, he’s definitely going to refuse again.</p>
<p>If he does that, I tease him back with something like, [Is an indirect kiss too embarrassing for you?]</p>
<p>I’m sure he’ll feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Uh, what?”</p>

<p>However, Kagisaka-kun casually takes a bite of the cake on the fork.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>(…Wait, wait, wait)</p>

<p>This is not what I expected!</p>
<p>I didn’t think he would eat it with such speed… or rather! An indirect kiss?!</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun use my fork…</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>As I panic internally, Kagisaka-kun offers his own pancake to me this time.</p>
<p>Once again, it’s the lover-style of using forks. (TN: Using each other.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>“Wait… Um, isn’t this embarrassing to do?”</p>
<p>“Tomori was the one who did it first, right? So it’s payback.”</p>
<p>“You should say it’s returning the favor in this case!”</p>
<p>“I also want to see your face stained with embarrassment. Or is it something you can only do to others but not to yourself?”</p>
<p>“H-Hey, don’t make fun of me!”</p>
<p>(TN: Payback, returning the favor. The wordplay revolves around the use of ‘仕返し’ (shi kaeshi), which means ‘payback’ and ‘お返し’ (o kaeshi), which means ‘returning the favor.’</p>
<p>Tomori emphasizes that the proper term to use in this situation should be returning the favor, which is reciprocating a kind action, rather than the negative connotation of seeking revenge or payback.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>Trying to maintain my dignity, I accept the offered pancake and take a bite…</p>
<p>…This is not good.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T16.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>Just the thought of an indirect kiss makes it hard to taste anything.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>But I feel happy.</p>

<p>Even if it’s until tomorrow morning, I can study hard.</p>
<p>It feels like I received that much energy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Kagisaka-kun, you’re different today.”</p>

<p>Perhaps due to my excitement, I forgot my sharp tongue and conveyed my honest thoughts.</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“You’re unusually kind. It’s like going back to the day of the entrance exam.”</p>

<p>On that snowy day, Kagisaka-kun helped me when I was in trouble. Yes, it was that event that made me start to feel something for him——.</p>

<p>“The one who’s kind is Tomori.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>I tilt my head in confusion.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>Kagisaka-kun, as if finally releasing something that has been pent up for a long time, opens his mouth.</p>

<p>“Do you remember? On the day of that exam, I said, ‘Even if I don’t pass, it doesn’t matter.’ “</p>
<p>“Yeah. But that was just a pretext to get me to go to the exam venue—”</p>
<p>“No, that was my true feelings.”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“At first, I didn’t even want to take it. I took the exam at Aisu because my family wanted me to.”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>Why is he suddenly talking about this?</p>
<p>I’m incredibly curious, but perhaps because of Kagisaka-kun’s unusually serious expression, I choose to listen without saying anything.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>“You know, I’ve never really gotten along with my family. After graduating from middle school, I planned to leave home, move away and work to support myself.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, what about high school…”</p>
<p>“I had no plans for further education. But my family strongly opposed that and said, ‘If you pass the entrance exam for Aisu Academy, we’ll let you live on your own. We’ll pay for it.’ “</p>
<p>“So, they wanted to make sure you continued your education at Aisu?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was to prevent the scandal of the second son of the Kagisaka family refusing to pursue higher education. Aisu is a prestigious school, and they thought that while kicking me out of the family, I might be able to reform myself.”</p>

<p>It’s a naive thought, Kagisaka-kun murmured cynically.</p>

<p>“But then, why did Kagisaka-kun take the exam?”</p>

<p>After saving that retriever, he could have boycotted the exam.</p>
<p>Yet he showed up at the exam venue and entered the school with top grades.</p>

<p>“I became curious.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>“Curious?”</p>
<p>“At first, I had decided to submit a blank answer sheet and fail. I thought the students at Aisu Academy were no good either because I thought Aisu is filled with elite kids who were raised in a sheltered environment. Those kinds of people usually react to the name ‘Kagisaka.'”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Since the day I was born, there were many people who wanted to be friends with me just because I was Kagisaka. I even had someone say, ‘I’m only being friends with you because my parents told me to ‘ “</p>
<p>” …..! “</p>
<p>“I thought the people at Aisu would be the same. I thought they would judge others based on their family backgrounds or people that only try to gain benefits from anything. But…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“…But?”</p>

<p>As I ask, Kagisaka-kun falls silent for a moment and then…</p>

<p>“On the day of the exam, I encountered an exception.”</p>

<p>He reminisces with a calm and gentle expression.</p>

<p>“That snowy day. When I saw that panicked retriever in the middle of the intersection, I knew I had to help him.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“There were many Aisu students who came to take the entrance exam around me. But everyone was ignoring that retriever. They pretended not to see it.”</p>
<p>“That’s because if they were late for the exam, they wouldn’t be able to enter the school, so they had no choice…”</p>
<p>“I can see it that way now. But at that time, I was different. Ah… As I thought, the students at Aisu are cold-hearted. They wouldn’t bother helping a troubled dog if there was no benefit. I had become distrustful of ‘elites’.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“But my thinking was wrong. There was one person who rushed to the retriever even before me, a reckless idiot.”</p>
<p>“!? You mean…?!”</p>
<p>“You should be able to guess her name without me saying it, right?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>Kagisaka-kun looks straight into my eyes and continues.</p>

<p>“I still remember it well. In the midst of the falling snow, that idiot threw away her red umbrella and ran straight towards the intersection.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Frankly, I was surprised. If you were even slightly late for the exam, you wouldn’t be able to enter. Helping a dog doesn’t guarantee that someone will be grateful. Yet, without hesitation, they rescued the retriever. They were too kind-hearted,” I say.</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Then… I became interested. Maybe Aisu Academy isn’t the kind of place I thought it was. Maybe it’s not just filled with people who judge others based on their background. Maybe there are people like her, kind and innocent… or so I thought.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“As a result, after finding the owner of the retriever who was nearby, I went to the exam venue. I used the name Kagisaka to cancel my ‘lateness’ and gave my all in the exam.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Do you remember? The other day after school, you said, ‘You helped me again.’ Yes, I did save you when you were almost attacked by the retriever. But at that time, who was really being saved? It was me.”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun…”</p>
<p>“——Thank you. I’ve always wanted to express my gratitude. Thanks to Tomori, my distrust in people has improved a little,” Kagisaka-kun sincerely says.</p>

<p>Honest.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>Sincerely.</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun expressed words of gratitude to me, which is usually engaged in banter.</p>

<p>(…What should I do?)</p>

<p>My mind is like a washing machine in full operation, all mixed up.</p>
<p>I’m surprised to receive gratitude from him, who we usually just argue with.</p>
<p>The happiness of knowing that Kagisaka-kun has been grateful to me all this time…</p>

<p>In moments like this, I wonder what I should say and hesitate.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>Kagisaka-kun seems a little down in the seat opposite me.</p>
<p>Perhaps he regrets not expressing his gratitude earlier. Or maybe…</p>

<p>“——Hey, this might be sudden, but…”</p>

<p>‘Can we hold hands?’ I muster up the courage and ask, driven by a certain possibility.</p>

<p>“Huh? What’s with that sudden request?”</p>
<p>“Well… I thought it would be better for you that way.”</p>

<p>Until recently, things were different, but now I have a solid reason why I want to hold his hand. So I gather all my courage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“Do you know? When people feel stressed, their hands tend to get cold.”</p>
<p>“Well, let me tell you, people don’t feel stressed when they’re expressing gratitude——”</p>
<p>“I understand that. But I think your hand feels cold right now.”</p>
<p>“…tsk.”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun murmurs, ‘For someone smart, you’re also perceptive,’ and then he says firmly,</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>My heart felt like it was being crushed tightly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>That means he doesn’t want to hold hands with someone like me…</p>

<p>“Something’s not right.”</p>
<p>“Huuuh? What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the case? We’re always fighting, but suddenly you act so friendly——”</p>
<p>“Ungrateful. I thought you were trying to thank me earlier.”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>
<p>“You said something like, ‘Actually, I was the one who was really saved back then,’ in a cheesy line straight out of a shoujo manga, expressing gratitude. But you won’t listen to my request?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…You’re way too innocent.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-narrow-sky-1"></span>

<p>‘Since I turned you down once, why don’t you just give up on someone introverted like me.’ Kagisaka-kun sighed as if he had resigned himself.</p>

<p>“Alright. Do as you please.”</p>
<p>“You have a good sense of knowing when to give up.”</p>

<p>While trying to conceal the tumultuous beating of my heart, I grab Kagisaka-kun’s left hand that is on the desk with my right hand.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>While trying to conceal the tumultuous beating of my heart, I grab Kagisaka-kun’s left hand that is on the desk with my right hand.</p>
<p>The sensation I feel on my fingertips is the touch of his slender and long fingers. Clearly larger than my own hand, it is the palm of a boy.</p>

<p>“Whoa, it’s oddly warm.”</p>
<p>“Huhu, I’m a woman with a higher body temperature than average. During winter, my friends often ask me to lend them a hand.”</p>
<p>“You human warmer.”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun giggles, but his palm feels incredibly cold.</p>
<p>Well then, let me warm it up for you.</p>

<p>My body temperature right now is higher than usual.</p>
<p>I’ve warmed the hands of many female friends before, but this is the first time I’m warming a boy’s hand. And on top of that, it’s the hand of a boy I like.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it makes my body temperature rise even more.</p>

<p>“How about we study like this for a while?”</p>
<p>“Your dominant arm is occupied.”</p>
<p>“No worries. I’m ambidextrous.”</p>
<p>“You’re a genius even in such aspects.”</p>
<p>“Is it okay if we stay like this until you’re satisfied?”</p>
<p>“It’s typical of you, Tomori. You want to see me embarrassed, but it won’t be that easy.”</p>
<p>“You’re being cheeky? In that case…”</p>

<p>I touch Kagisaka-kun’s wrist with the tip of my index finger.</p>
<p>The rhythm of his finger is transmitted to my wrist.</p>
<p>A gentle melody that I want to feel all the time.</p>

<p>“It’s warm.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun, your hand is getting warmer, isn’t it? Look, it seems like it’s happily pulsating. Thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump… Oh, your heartbeat has quickened. Maybe you’re feeling… excited?”</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense.”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun turns his head away with a pout and whispers softly.</p>

<p>(Sorry, but please forgive me.)</p>

<p>I was afraid that if I didn’t tease him, I would be overwhelmed by my own embarrassment.</p>
<p>Besides, I wanted to show you who avoids connections with others, even if it’s just with one hand.</p>

<p>《When you connect with someone like this, your heart feels warm, huh?》</p>

<p>I write my embarrassing true feelings on my secret account.</p>

<p>(Ah… Today was truly an amazing day.)</p>

<p>Study together.</p>
<p>We ate cake together.</p>
<p>Having a conversation without making any frivolity.</p>
<p>Holding hands like this and feeling the pulse sound of someone you love</p>
<p>It’s like…</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>《It felt like a dateeeee!》</p>

<p>The time is evening.</p>
<p>After returning to the apartment, I checked my secret account and found such tweets.</p>

<p>《I love you~! Love you-love you-love you, I love you so much, K-kun~!》</p>
<p>《I wonder if something really bad will happen a few days later as a backlash from today.》(TN: Misfortune in fortune.)</p>
<p>《It’s a shame that my final request was rejected, but I’m so happy to be with K-kun~!》</p>

<p>“You’re way too excited.”</p>

<p>My cheeks involuntarily relaxed, seeing her overwhelming joy.</p>
<p>After that, I collapsed onto the bed.</p>

<p>)I didn’t expect you to suddenly ask to hold my hand.)</p>

<p>Tomori must have realized this after listening to my story.</p>
<p>That I felt stressed because of my family situation.</p>
<p>That’s why she warmed up the cold Kimitaka Kagisaka’s heart and hand like that.</p>

<p>“Truly everyone’s friend.”</p>

<p>Friendly to everyone, always caring for others, and never asking for anything in return.</p>
<p>It was the same when she saved the retriever on that snowy day.</p>

<p>(Right, Azusa Tomori is kind.)</p>

<p>It’s like the warmth of a sunny day in spring.</p>
<p>That’s why I want to be close to her.</p>
<p>On that snowy day, I was attracted to Tomori.</p>

<p>(I even enrolled at Aisu Academy to chase after her.)</p>

<p>I’m truly grateful for that.</p>
<p>That’s why…even more so…</p>

<p>“Today is the last time.”</p>

<p>I’ll stop getting closer to Tomori.</p>
<p>While gazing at the palm of my left hand, I make that decision.</p>

<p>(Regarding what happened today, I looked at her secret account, helped her choose clothes, and did things like going on a date to fulfill even a small part of Tomori’s wishes.)</p>

<p>Because I thought it would be the last time, I took action to make Tomori smile, even bending my rules.</p>
<p>I even confessed about my past, which I hadn’t planned to talk about…</p>

<p>“This should repay my debt.”</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve always wanted to thank Tomori for what happened back then.</p>
<p>Just that.</p>

<p>There are no other emotions beyond that.</p>
<p>As proof, at the parting moment, I refused Tomori’s request.</p>

<p>[I want you to tell me your LINE contact. As the class representative, I want to have everyone’s contact information.]</p>

<p>She probably thought that with the momentum of today, she could get my contact information.</p>
<p>But I shook my head.</p>

<p>Since today is the end, there’s no need for unnecessary connections.</p>
<p>In the end, I couldn’t resolve the question of why Tomori needed to have a secret account, but I guess I have to put an end to it.</p>

<p>“…Sigh.”</p>

<p>After exhaling as if making up my mind, I delete Tomori’s secret account from the bookmarks on my smartphone.</p>
<p>Even if I’ve come this far, someone could still trace it back from my internet history.</p>

<p>(I won’t let that happen again.)</p>

<p>This is also for Azusa Tomori’s sake.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no intention of holding hands like we did today ever again.</p>
<p>Even if it’s just holding one hand, there will never be a connection between us again.</p>

<p>She is [Everyone’s friend.]</p>
<p>And she is an irreplaceable benefactor to Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve maintained a distant attitude since enrolling, trying to keep her away.</p>
<p>Yes, someone like me, a former delinquent, should stay away from Tomori’s vicinity.</p>

<p>[When you connect with someone like this, your heart feels warm, huh?]</p>

<p>However.</p>
<p>Even though I delete the bookmark, the warmth I felt today doesn’t seem to disappear from my hand.</p>
