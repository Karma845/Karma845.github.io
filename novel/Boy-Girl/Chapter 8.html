<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Pistils and Stamens</h3>

<p>The flower bed is located in a sunny spot, right behind the school building. Not many people walk by, so it would be the best place to grow plants in the school.</p>
<p>From a distance, I could see some Zucchini Flowers blooming.</p>
In front of it, I can see a girl with a quirky hair style that resembles the sheep of my grandfather’s sheep.</p>
<p>[Good morning, what happened?]</p>
[Hya.! Ah, the boy from yesterday]</p>
[The flowers are blooming, have you pollinated them]</p>
[Uh, well.. You know&#8230;]</p>
[It’d be easier if you had a cotton bud]</p>
[I don’t have any]</p>

<p>The girl from the gardening club blushes and turns over in embarrassment</p>
Apparently. She forgot to or didn’t do enough research. But if we do nothing, the zucchini would never grow. Fortunately, I’m not that heartless to only tell her the problem without giving her a solution.</p>


<p>[Oh, the green ones are the female flower, and the one that is not green is the male one. Can I pick it?]</p>
<p>[Eh? Yes, sure]</p>
<p>[Since the petals are in the way, peel them off. Next, rub the exposed stamens against the pistils. Do you understand?]</p>
<p>[I- I want to try it! I think… Am I doing this correctly?]</p>
<p>[One stamen can be used for 2-3 pistils]</p>
<p>[Oh, Ok!]</p>

<p>Taking Hayato’s advice, she started pollinating the flowers</p>
Speaking of which, this flower bed is pretty big. But of course, it’s smaller compared to the fields</p>
There was not much time left before homeroom starts in the morning</p>
I’m in a bit hurry, but I’m pretty happy since it’s been quite a while since I pollinated flowers</p>

<p>[You know, I thought vegetables were supposed to grow on their own&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Hm?]</p>
<p>[The stamens and pistils stick together, and with that kind of activity, the fruits are born]</p>
<p>[Yes, that’s right]</p>



<p>Working in the fields was an everyday thing for me.</p>
There were many farmers in Tsukinose and this kind of work was common. I also thought this was a mere chore.</p>

<p>That’s why the beliefs from the girl in the gardening club were so new to me, and I couldn’t help but look at her face.</p>
<p>When she noticed my gaze, she seemed to blush, then suddenly stood up, flapped her hands and started to panic</p>


<p>[The way you phrase it… isn’t it so weird?! A stamen and a pistil… how naughty&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Whoa, Wait!]</p>
<p>[I mean, the pistils and the stamens…]</p>
<p>[Oi, calm down!]</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do at her sudden outburst.</p>
<p>That’s because I lacked the ability to cope with girls of my generation.</p>

<p>[Mitake-san with a red face talking about stamen… what on earth are you doing, Kirishima-kun?]</p>
<p>[Ni- Nikaido-san!]</p>
<p>[Haru- I mean, Nikaido!]</p>

<p>As if to find ground zero of the situation between the both of us, Haruki appeared.</p>
<p>Her eyes had a condemning glint in them. She is a beautiful girl, so she has a strange power that makes both of us back down.</p>
<p>[Uhm, Uhh, I… G-Good morning, Excuse me!]</p>
[&#8230; Ah]</p>

<p>Perhaps she couldn’t stand the atmosphere, combined with the fact that she’s really embarrassed, she decided to run away.</p>
I was left alone with Haruki, who seemed to be in a daze.</p>

<p>[This is, well you know&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Haha, she looks like one of those guys when Gen-san gets mad at them, Hayato]</p>
<p>[Haruki?]</p>
<p>I was pondering how to excuse myself, but contrary to my expectations, Haruki’s cheerful voice came back. His face was that of a naughty girl, as if her prank had succeeded</p>
<p>[Since when did you look?]</p>
[It started about halfway about pollination? I was watching her, wondering what she was doing. Then she suddenly turned red and started to panic, and I knew I had to help her]</p>
<p>[So you’ve been here for quite a while. If you had seen her, you should’ve called out to her. She said something weird to me afterwards&#8230;]</p>
<p>[I have a position and character at school]</p>
<p>[But not in front of me?]</p>
[Hayato is fine]</p>
<p>Haruki twirls her skirt and said that with a happy smile</p>
<p>[We’re best friends, right?]</p>
[It’s… you know&#8230;]</p>
<p>It was an absurd answer</p>
Both of us had a sneer on our faces</p>
<p>(Welp, I shouldn’t think too much about it)</p>

<p>I’m not sure why I interpreted it that way</p>
