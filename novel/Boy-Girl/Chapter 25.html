<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Himeko x Mascot </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a 20-minute walk from the apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in the countryside of Tsukinose, the school is not lumped together with the elementary school, and instead of a one-story wooden building, it is a three-story reinforced concrete building. That was the middle school Himeko attended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school uniform is not the wild jumper skirt of the past, but a cute checkered skirt and sailor uniform with the same pattern on the collar, which she loves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko was a beautiful girl, even in this urban school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes are bright and sassy, her hair is wavy and loose, and her figure is not bad at all, except for a few parts that she expects to grow in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a transfer student, she was very popular and attracted a lot of attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Himeko ran into the classroom on the verge of being late and let out a sad sigh, &#8220;Haa~&#8230;&#8221; it was very noticeable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A classmate of hers, Honoka Torikai, who has quickly become a good friend of Himeko, comes over to talk to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko-chan, what&#8217;s with the sigh&#8230; Did something happen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, yes, a little.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you get upset because the TV broadcast date was off again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I made a fuss about missing a week, but I&#8217;m fine now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like not being able to find the wooden telegraph pole?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think I&#8217;m getting used to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like the fact that you didn&#8217;t see any dead frogs or lizards on the road today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really don&#8217;t see any― but then again, I&#8217;m not a countryside bumpkin!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahaha, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s face turned bright red and she stood up to deny it desperately, but Honoka Torikai and everyone around her watched her smilingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko tries to hide the fact that she is from the countryside, but on her first day at the new school, her disappointment is exposed when she is surprised to find out that there are no coin-operated rice mills, and she doesn&#8217;t know the concept of private railways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, she has become a mascot to be teased. Incidentally, Himeko herself thinks that she hasn&#8217;t been exposed as a country bumpkin yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, what&#8217;s the matter? Was there something that surprised you about the difference from your old place?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, something like that. Not things this time, but people.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An old friend of Onii&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t seen her in a few years, and she&#8217;d changed so much that it was kind of bothering me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What was she like?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, she used to be the kind of bad boy who ran around the fields and mountains with Onii, who liked to play pranks, who got angry a lot, and who still cared about me and took care of me, but now she looks like an honor student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fuun~&#8230; you liked her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230; yeah, maybe. Did I really like her?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　These words fell into Himeko&#8217;s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a vague, faint feeling unique to a young child. It was a vague feeling that she hesitated to call her first love. Still, when she applied the word &#8220;love&#8221; to it, she felt them subside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must have liked her. She doesn&#8217;t know what kind of feeling that is. But Himeko did like Haruki, even though she thought of her as a boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if it was a genuine feeling, Himeko&#8217;s feelings would never come true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweet, sad pain throbbed in her chest. Unbeknownst to Himeko, her hand was resting on her thin chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko-chan&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she met her again, her childhood friend had changed into something she had never imagined. There was no trace of the bad boy, and even though she was from the same gender, she looked so innocent and pretty that it made her sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when she saw him standing next to her brother as what he had done in the past, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel a sense of injustice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Honoka Torikai saw Himeko muttering sadly, she did not feel like making fun of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, the romantic maiden sensor in her reacted vigorously, making her want to meddle. The rest of the girls in the class seemed to agree, and one by one they gathered around Himeko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kirishima-san, tell us more about that person!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you have any stories that tell us more about this person!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How do you feel about that person now!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the thing, if you don&#8217;t tell her how you feel, you&#8217;ll regret it later!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, umm, uh&#8230;regret, later&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the countryside of Tsukinose, Himeko had never experienced being surrounded by girls her own age, so she was swarmed by them all at once, and they would call out to her in turn, making her look around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was one word that she couldn&#8217;t miss hearing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was one thing that Himeko regretted terribly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Saki-chan&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tsukinose&#8217;s best friend in the countryside, and the only one of her generation. She was the girl she had grown up with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the sudden move, she hadn&#8217;t been able to tell her until right before she left. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wish you had told me sooner! I wanted to do more with Hime-chan, and I still have a lot to do with Onii-san too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a sobbing fit. She had a hard time quieting down. In the end, they cried and screamed together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She laughed and forgave her, and they were still in touch, but the physical distance was still unmanageable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Saki and Hayato remained awkward for a long time, and they ended up moving out of the house with that awkwardness still intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Himeko thought about Saki, she felt even more regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Saki-chan, it seems like she still cares about Onii.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she thought about it, Himeko felt that she couldn&#8217;t stay like this, she had to do something. Then she slapped her cheeks and stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do my best! First of all, I&#8217;m going to talk to Haru-chan and get to know her! We&#8217;ll be best friends!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then she raised her fist in the air, and Honoka Torikai and the others around her shouted, &#8220;&#8216;Ooohhhh,'&#8221; and clapped their hands. These girls had the eyes of predators who had found their prey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, yeah, let&#8217;s talk about the future, Himeko-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell your Onee-sans more about it? We&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the first time in a long time that I&#8217;ve had to have a meeting over tapioca.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, a tapioca meeting now? Isn&#8217;t there anywhere that sells it anymore?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, umm, that&#8230; tapioca!? Tapioca is all the craze now!? No way, I want to try it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The season for tapioca has long passed. Even though it was just a joke, Himeko had a good ear for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the countryside, fashions are slow to catch up― and Himeko was the perfect example of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, yes, that&#8217;s exactly what Kirishima-san is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, Onee-san will buy you a drink!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko-chan, stay as you are, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? Huh, everyone?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko was confused by the reactions of those around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faces in the classroom were kind and smiling. Some of them were even shaking their shoulders and holding back their laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, Himeko further established her position as the class mascot.</span></p>
