<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; Overthrow!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than a normal bouquet of flowers, it was more like a bouquet of various round vegetable flowers packed tightly and compactly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centered around a male zucchini flower, small white, yellow, and purple flowers of eggplant, tomatoes, and other plants were woven in the manner of a flower crown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Hayato, who didn&#8217;t know much about flowers, could tell that it was very elaborate. And above all―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of flowers are gathered together in a lively way, haha, even vegetable flowers look completely different when you look at them like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;O-Ohh, you know, from pruning! I thought I should do this to the ones I cut off!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. You&#8217;re amazing, Mitake-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tsu!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was honestly impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why a vegetable flower? Why is Mitake-san here? There were many thoughts inside Hayato’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the bouquet of vegetable flowers looked so alive that his thoughts were blown away. His eyes were full of admiration for Minamo Mitake, who had created it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Auu~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake was bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it&#8217;s just the word &#8220;adorable&#8221; being hurled at her unexpectedly, and with the opposite sex looking at her like that, her mind goes blank and she becomes a creature that can only cry and squeal &#8220;ahhhhhh&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Hmm&#8230; they&#8217;re similar after all)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato felt that she was just like the sheep of Tsukinose&#8217;s Genji, who could only bleat when startled, and he bit back a chuckle in the back of his throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought she was being laughed at, and her face grew redder and redder, and she jerked in embarrassment― and then something flew at Hayato with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Auuh!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he caught it, he saw that it was a Coke bottle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t understand what it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked around and saw an old man in hospital clothes, his face flushed like a boiled rice cake, shaking his shoulders as he threw an overhand throw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Y-You little bastard! What did you do to my Minamo!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grandpa!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh&#8230;E-Ehh!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bouquet of vegetables and flowers in Minamo Mitake&#8217;s hand, and an old man in a hospital gown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at one of them and one of the others in turn, Hayato guessed what the situation was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, kid, get over here. You made Minamo cry&#8230; What the hell did you do!? No way&#8230; Answer me, and if you do, there will be no mercy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m just, uh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, Grandpa, no!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He waved a simple walking cane around, as if he had misunderstood something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old man&#8217;s face was as red as his granddaughter&#8217;s, and Hayato, who had cooled down a bit, thought, &#8220;Oh, maybe it&#8217;s in their blood?&#8221; or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his spirit and the sharpness of his eyes made Hayato feel that he was more fierce than the skilled hunters of the hunting club, and he flinched. In fact, the stance of the staff he wielded was so fierce that he could not believe it was that of an old man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare you attack my granddaughter!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ouch, it hurts!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;G-Grandpa!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it took a lot of effort to clear up this misunderstanding.</span></p>
