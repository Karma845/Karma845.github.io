<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Why?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that had been going on in Hayato&#8217;s mind was now connected at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mimicry, her convenience store lunches, frozen food, this living room in a house with no lights on, and an only child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only things in Haruki&#8217;s room were games, manga, plastic models, and other things that would allow her to spend time alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, Hayato, you see, the thing is. It&#8217;s just that, that thing is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s eyes swam, and she tried to cover it up by waving her hands in the air and calling it a thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking back, Hayato had never seen anyone other than Haruki in this house. Not even a hint of it. Haruki must have been alone in this house for many years now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now she&#8217;s smiling and trying to act like she&#8217;s fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato thought that it was,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">very much,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and excessively,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">he disliked it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was annoyed with himself for not realizing it sooner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s go, Haruki.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, hey, Hayato! Wait, where are we going&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato turned off the stove that was boiling water and forcibly took Haruki&#8217;s arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Haruki&#8217;s point of view, Hayato&#8217;s face looked as if he was angry, and she tried to raise her voice, but the end of her words became smaller and smaller.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, Haru-chan, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s voice was too loud, and Himeko came to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Himeko saw was Hayato forcibly pulling on Haruki&#8217;s arm. This is the older brother who is trying to take the beautiful girl he grew up with away from home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, she wanted to say something, but stopped when she saw Hayato&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face was very stern and strong-willed, as if he wasn&#8217;t going to listen to anything she had to say. However, Himeko knew that her brother&#8217;s face in this kind of situation meant that he was thinking of her, and that she could rely on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko, let&#8217;s stop at the supermarket and go back home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, okay. I&#8217;ll get my stuff together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H-Hime-chan too!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was pulled along by her childhood friend&#8217;s siblings without saying a word, without understanding why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t know why this was happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Haruki knew that they were doing it for her, and strangely enough, she didn&#8217;t feel bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Umm, can I change my clothes first&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you want to wear your uniform?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221;</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Haruki&#8217;s request to let her change into casual clothes was rejected by Himeko with a huge smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ten-story family apartment building a short distance away from Haruki&#8217;s house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the kitchen of her childhood friend&#8217;s house on the sixth floor of the building, the items she had just bought at the supermarket were laid out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who had been forcibly brought in by Hayato and Himeko, was unable to grasp the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll chop up the vegetables, and you grate up the garlic and ginger.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Un-der-stood! Haru-chan, can you get the bowls and seasonings?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, yeah&#8230; where is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knows what they want to do. She can tell that it was for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she didn&#8217;t understand why this was happening and what exactly they were going to make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki did as Hayato and Himeko asked and helped with the cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Hayato, you&#8217;re really good at this&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time for Haruki to see Hayato cook, and even from a layman&#8217;s point of view, she could tell that he was quite skilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of Haruki&#8217;s feelings, the cooking proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minced pork, chopped chives, cabbage, Chinese cabbage, green onions, shiitake mushrooms, grated garlic and ginger, salt and pepper, soy sauce to taste, kneaded together to make the bean paste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bean paste was made by grating and kneading the ingredients together. When she was presented with a round crust made of flour, she knew exactly what they were going to make.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gyoza? It looks like a lot of food for that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of work to make, so I thought I&#8217;d make as much as I could when I had the time and freeze the rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re making your guests help you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s Haruki.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because it&#8217;s me&#8230; Fufu~, I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them silently wrapped the red bean paste for the gyoza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki took a while to get the hang of it at first, but once she mastered it, her excellence as a student could be shown, and Hayato was impressed with her dexterity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them, only Himeko was able to mass produce distorted gyoza objects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hime-chan&#8230; wow&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-Shut up! I just want Onii to make it for me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That didn&#8217;t stop Himeko from making the gyoza, and the smiles on all three of their faces showed that they were enjoying the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gyoza is then steamed in a hot pan with oil and water with flour dissolved in it to make a beautiful feathered gyoza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rice, miso soup, and the pickled eggplant that Minamo Mitake had given him the other day were all that was needed for dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki exclaimed in amazement when she saw it laid out in the dining room. An inexplicable feeling of elation welled up in her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Itadakimasu~&#8230; Ah, it&#8217;s hot! Onii, water!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;What are you doing, Himeko&#8230; aren&#8217;t you going to eat it, Haruki?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;ll have some.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko was making a fuss about the heat, and Hayato was taking care of the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki looks at them and puts the gyoza in her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s still hot, but delicious.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It tasted awfully good and nostalgic. It had a special taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking back, it had been a long time since Haruki had sat around the table with someone like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One by one, the chopsticks moved forward, and before they knew it, there were only a few gyoza left on the platter, and Haruki and Himeko were fighting over them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eat the rice, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because Haru-chan&#8217;s got the energy!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ngu, yummm~!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dinner went on with this silly, childish exchange, and Haruki could feel her stomach as well as her heart filling up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh, I see. I guess I&#8217;m weaker than I thought&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s probably why Hayato brought himself along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hayato didn&#8217;t know what to say, so they sat around the table like this. &#8216;He was a clumsy guy&#8217;, she thought with a chuckle. Suddenly, she felt tears welling up in the corners of her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato looks at Haruki&#8217;s face and says, scratching his head, as if he&#8217;s having trouble saying something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you know&#8230; it&#8217;s basically just Himeko and me for dinner most of the time. So, if it&#8217;s okay with you Haruki, why don&#8217;t you join us for dinner from now on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, Haruki didn&#8217;t understand what was being said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about Hayato and Himeko&#8217;s families? Many things came to her mind such as the fact that Hayato and Himeko had families, or that they were good cooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what came out of her mouth was a pure question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki didn&#8217;t know why they were doing this much for her. She was confused by the favor that had been shown to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Haruki, who had always been subjected to feelings of calculation and lust behind kindness, it was terribly confusing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki herself has many feelings, some of which she cannot express directly. There are things she can&#8217;t say, and she&#8217;s sure Hayato is curious about them too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he didn&#8217;t say anything, and she didn&#8217;t know why he would say such a thing to her and reach out to her&#8230; and do so much for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s because you&#8217;re Haruki&#8230; Our friend.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what came back to her was such a simple reason― it struck a chord within her, and something that had been floating in the corners of her eyes fell out and ran down her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do I owe Hayato for this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t really owe me anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, I promise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the somewhat blunt Hayato and the mischievous smiling Haruki intertwine their little fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are things they can&#8217;t say to each other. But there were things that could be conveyed without saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Goodness gracious, you two are as close as ever&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko looked at the two of them with a dumbfounded and slightly envious look in her eyes.</span></p>
