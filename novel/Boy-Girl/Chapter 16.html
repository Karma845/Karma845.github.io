<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; An Unexpected Promise</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ch 16. Unexpected Promise</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early summer rain hits the asphalt on my way to school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, I saw colorful umbrellas. Many of them were nice to look at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko, who was using a plain, black folding umbrella for practicality, muttered, [Damn, this umbrella has no girl power…] and headed for her school sullenly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing my sister off, I walked through the school gate, admiring the paved road that, unlike the countryside, was free of mud and puddles. Then, out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a few days since I last watered the zucchini, and the ones from back then should be fruiting soon. As I thought about it, I became more and more curious about the condition of the flower bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　And so, I went over to the garden, I saw a girl with curly hair, tending to the vegetables despite the rain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, they seem to be growing nicely! I think I’ll harvest some.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eep!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How are they?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good, just look at them! The zucchini have grown well, and the tomatoes and eggplants I pruned are…well&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, could I borrow your pruning shears? Let’s harvest some of these…though I wish I had a bag or something.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I have plastic bags!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　In addition to the zucchini, there were some fruits growing. Some of them were overripe. I guess she had missed the opportunity due to her lack of knowledge in harvesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a pair of borrowed pruning shears in hand, I explained to her the appropriate time to harvest each of the plants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was already familiar with this kind of work. However, since it was the first time for her, she took it very seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flower bed was quite large. But compared to a field, it wasn’t much more than a mere vegetable garden, so the harvest was over in a matter of minutes. Even so, we ended up with a lot of products in the plastic bags.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female student from the gardening club held the contents of the bag with an emotional look in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was her first ‘gem’ that she had ever grown, so she must be very impressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, uhm…half! You can take half!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh, are you sure? I’m grateful for it, thank you.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re the reason that I was able to harvest these plants.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not a big deal, honestly. But, thank you.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My pleasure!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She replied with a very big smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the joy that was radiating out of her, I couldn’t help but feel happy as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took a deep breath as she finished packing the vegetables into spare plastic bags.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, she looked up at me with a somewhat nervous and desperate expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ah, excuse me!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-How can I help?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was nervous because I rarely talked to girls of my age. There was no girl for me to talk to anyways</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, it was hard not to get nervous when she, who was squirming, looked up at me due to our height differences. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the determined look in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[U-Uhm, c-can you give me your email address… or LINE ID? I mean, I don’t have anyone else I can talk to and I also have a lot of questions that I want to ask you… I know that you might be surprised by something like this out of the blue. But if you don’t mind, I’ll make sure that I won’t do anything that can cause you trouble&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pretty extreme request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a serious expression on her blushing face, and her phone was clenched tightly so that her hands turned red. I could see that she was desperately hoping for something,  and her expression hurt my heart. It must’ve taken her a lot of courage to ask me that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　But, I already had a response for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’m sorry….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-oh…I… understand&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, you’re wrong. It’s not like I don’t want to!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t have a smartphone… I’m a transfer student from the countryside with no signal&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, inevitably, I had to make an excuse to answer her. I was hoping that she’d understand my circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, it seems like the reason was conveyed properly to her. Though she was taken aback at first, gradually, she began to giggle and let out a laugh. Awkwardly, I scratched my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My name is Minami Mitake from class C. Please call me Mitake!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m Hayato Kirishima from class A. Could you teach me about smartphones when I get one?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ I’ll be waiting. It’s a promise, okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uh huh… yeah… I promise…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t expect the word “Promise” to come out of my mouth. The thought of it made me freeze for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　For some reason, the word “Promise” had a somewhat special feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I hesitated for a moment before answering her honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but think about Haruki’s face in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it would be unnatural to reject her offer at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing she wanted was to exchange contact information, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It shouldn’t be a big deal.] I told that to myself and accepted the vegetables from her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, see you around.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yep!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early summer rain at the end of June. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vegetables and flowers blooming in the flowerbed became witnesses to an unexpected promise.</span></p>
