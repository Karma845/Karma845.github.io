<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Tomorrow, I&#039;ll Borrow Haru-chan, Okay? </h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Friday, the last day of the school week. It was the evening before the promised day for Hayato to go out with Haruki to get a new smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was another hot and humid morning and it didn&#8217;t ease up even in the evening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa ~Huu ~tadaimaaa~ Onii, ice cream~&#8221; [TLN: tadaima = I’m home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s some in the freezer, take it with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Himeko-chan, welcome back~.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Himeko came home drenched in sweat, she was greeted in an air-conditioned room by her brother, Hayato, who was working in the kitchen making dinner, and Haruki, who was lying on the living room sofa reading a manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki promised to have dinner with them, and immediately went to visit Hayato and Himeko&#8217;s house. Because they were such good friends, she didn&#8217;t have any reservations. Perhaps she also felt lonely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Haruki&#8217;s appearance was all sorts of awful, so relaxed that Himeko couldn&#8217;t help but raise an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was lying face down on the couch with a cushion in her arms, her skirt rolled up in the air, her socks off, her feet flailing about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her guard was too loose for a girl, and as expected, Himeko saw that she was wearing a pair of dark blue boxer shorts that were plain and unattractive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? Oh, here it is! It&#8217;s a manga about the Taisho era that became popular as an anime a while ago! I couldn&#8217;t buy it at all because it was in short supply, but I finally managed to get my hands on it. Come on, Himeko-chan, let&#8217;s come over and read it together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it, it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki tilted her head in confusion, which was so adorable that even Himeko couldn&#8217;t help but groan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the fact that it was supposed to be an extremely sexy look, it looked disappointing and Himeko couldn&#8217;t help but put her hand on her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Himeko turns her attention to her brother, she will see him chopping vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if this was his natural state, and he didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For better or worse, it&#8217;s the same old relationship, and while she&#8217;s taken aback, her mouth drops open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko-chan, come on, come on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Mou~!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki sat up, a manga in her hand, her eyes glittering as she patted the sofa next to her. Apparently, she wanted to read the manga together with Himeko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko lets out a big sigh, but decides to read the manga with Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a shounen manga with a lot of battle action, but it seems to have really stuck with the two girls, and they become absorbed in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan, where&#8217;s the rest, where&#8217;s volume 2!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here it is. Welcome to this side of the swamp!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell are they doing, those girls&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the two of them were reading in silence until dinner was ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bon appétit~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, Onii, this is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tomatoes, don&#8217;t forget to eat them.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s dinner was cold shabu salad udon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was made with thin udon noodles that were tightly packed in cold water, topped with potherb mustard, baby leaves, green onions, cucumber, kaiware, tomatoes, and cold-shaved pork belly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was served with ponzu, sesame sauce, or any other dressing of their choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very hot today, and not many people had much appetite, but they were willing to eat this light dish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, Himeko looked reluctant when she was served a raw tomato, which she doesn&#8217;t like, but she forced herself to swallow it under the strange pressure of Hayato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were finishing their meal and taking a sip of tea, Himeko suddenly remembered something and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that reminds me, Onii, tomorrow Saturday, can I borrow Haru-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we can check out some phones on Sunday.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko knew that Haruki and Hayato were finally going to buy a phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also knew that Haruki&#8217;s taste in clothes was devastating. She definitely did. As a girl of her age, she couldn&#8217;t overlook that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on a date, Haruchan, a friend date.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;De-de-de-de-de-date!? With me!? I&#8217;ve never been on a date before though!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki reacted to the word &#8220;date&#8221; and her face suddenly turned red and she panicked. Himeko suppressed the urge to tease her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that big of a deal, Haru-chan has been on many dates with Onii. Such as a date to walk in the mountains, a date to jump into a river and get soaked, and a date to catch cicadas for six hours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a date without a hint of sex appeal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki claps her hands in agreement, while Hayato chuckles in the back of his throat as he recalls those days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you&#8217;re saying that Himeko-chan and I are going out together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, then what are we going to do? I mean, are you sure about this Hayato? You&#8217;ll be left out. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the three of us should―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Clothes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The three of us―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to buy clothes for Haru-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―Himeko, you&#8217;re&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s eyes were not smiling. They were filled with a sense of mission. She had the smile of a hunter who has found her prey and doesn&#8217;t want to miss it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki felt a chill run down her spine and her smile stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha-Hayato!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, now, I have to wash the dishes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You betrayed me!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her desperate pleas for help, Hayato ran into the kitchen, not wanting to be caught in the middle. His back was too eloquent in asserting that a man would be in his way if he were there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was not good at such girlish things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t dare to get involved with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to get along with Haru-chan more than I used to before, like looking at her clothes and talking with her more.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were Himeko&#8217;s heartfelt words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki felt a strong bond with Himeko when she saw the seriousness in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she sighed loudly as if she had lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay. Let&#8217;s have a date tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki felt a warmth in her heart as she realized that this younger friend of hers adored her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Himeko forcefully pulls Haruki to her feet. The smile on her face was so refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, Himeko-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you my clothes, and we can go pick out something to wear tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? Eh? Eh!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko had the look of &#8220;You&#8217;re not going out in those tacky casual clothes, are you?&#8221;. And then, without saying a word, Haruki was dragged into her room. Then the forced fashion show began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, something&#8217;s not right. Well then, try this one next.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yadaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa~, we&#8217;re still going with this!?&#8221; [TLN: yada = no more]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s sad cries echoed in the Kirishima house until late that night.</span></p>
