<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; A Promise</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classroom was in an uproar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki Nikaido is the flower of high mountains, and her actions are the focus of everyone’s attention. (T/N: Last chapter, I used “Flower of Takamine” which literally means flower of high mountains/stake. I wonder which is better)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki herself had acted as she should have, and she knew the consequences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that she talked to a boy without any particular reason was a special thing that would cause a lot of speculation towards her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nikaido-san and the transfer student?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it probably…she likes him?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No way, he’s a transfer student, so I guess they have their own business, I guess!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can hear their curious, whispering voices and also (sense/see?) their jealous glances</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m now the center of attention. There’s no way for me to run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Haruki and I understand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Etto… Uhh…. That’s&#8230; that&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haa… Nikaido&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Haruki said [that] with a cool face as before. That’s exactly what it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from the side, it was more like Hayato was being blamed for why he didn’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I could tell that Haruki made a mistake, so I decided to try my best to cover her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Speaking of which)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminds me of something that once happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a kid, Haruki was walking up the wooden fence that separated the farm with the field, and it suddenly broke down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the help of the adults who were working there, the sheep didn’t run away and we were saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wooden fence was rotten, so Haruki was neither blamed nor injured, fortunately. But in the times she had done something wrong, just like now, she’d keep saying “That thing, that thing… that thing was like that..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she tried to put on a clear face, I could see that the present Haruki was reacting the exact same way as the Haruki back then. Even her eyes that seemed to ask for help were the same as back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Honestly&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed for a bit and tried to think about what to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… that thing. I’m the one who was asked to do the flowerbed this morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh yes, that’s it! I want to finish it as early as possible, Are you free now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah also, bring your bag please]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ok]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a spur-of-the-moment improvisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with this, I succeeded in changing the situation into one where I needed her to help </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, my classmates began to lose interest and said, [Oh I see] and [That’s right].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki quickly left the classroom as if to deceive me. After that, I let out a sigh of relief. Mori-san seemed to be grinning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Way to go, transfer student]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha, shut up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I went to a small, empty room, in the old school building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about a quarter size of my classroom, the room itself is long but narrow with wooden flooring. It also looks a bit old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the floor was dust free and showed signs of having been well maintained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A secret base. This area is only used for storage, so no one ever comes here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a bit too empty to be called a base]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s true, how about we bring something here next time. You can also call this a shelter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A shelter?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure if it’s because nobody is around, but Haruki was in the bratty mode that she  was in her room the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn&#8217;t care about skirts and  sits cross-legged. But she seemed hesitant to take off her socks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I can’t show this Haruki to everyone in the classroom)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I held my temples as I looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small, empty, boarded-up room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a lonely place for a secret base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A refuge to get away from the hustle and bustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A room with no furniture or anything in it, just windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How did you find this place?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I accidentally found it. Look, there’s a key too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you serious? This is fine?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As long as we didn’t get caught, yes. Anyway, why don’t you sit down, Hayato?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geez]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure what to do, but I guess I’ll just do what she says for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well? What kind of idea did you come up with this time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Uhm. I don’t understand what you’re talking about]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki groaned while giving me a crisp reply. She seems hesitant about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was the one who invited me earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she was in her ‘school mode’, she made a careless act. However, her eyes left an impression on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she had something to tell me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Promise me you won’t laugh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s something for me to decide]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you laugh, you owe me one]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki’s sharp eyes were staring at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around and decided to hear her out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Honestly, I’ve always dreamed of having lunch… with my friends&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involuntarily, a stupid voice came out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who misunderstood it, lifted her eyebrows and protested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mou! It’s a really important thing for me! You see, that’s why… I’m having trouble asking them out… that’s why I’m alone, so&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last part of the word almost disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to imagine what Haruki said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene in the classroom up to the point that she used this room as her personal shelter. I’m pretty sure that was the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hurts when I imagined that she has been alone in this room for lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Honestly, what a troublesome girl)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I scratched my head and pulled out my lunch box from my bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see… then, your dreams will come true everyday, from now on]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hayato&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it different?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nah, it’s no different. Well then, this is a loan from me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s too cheap for a loan]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahaha, well, multiply it by 10!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, If there’s no particular business, we will be here at noon. How about you promise me that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A promise… I see, A promise…Yes, it’s a promise, Hayato! ]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, Ok then]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s eyes fluttered as I looked at her, but then she turned around and smiled innocently just like a child. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it’s because she couldn’t control her emotions that she held my hands so close, causing our foreheads to almost stick together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Too, too close!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that she’s a beautiful girl is a fact that I had to admit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Haruki got close with her big smile that she would never show to others, I couldn’t help but feel nervous..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a bit frustrated that she didn&#8217;t know what I was going through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Back off]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, sorry, sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pushed Haruki away and bluntly held out my little finger of my right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was aware that I was doing something childish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Promise?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I promise! Ehe~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our pinkies entwined. Now, we shared another small, secret promise. After that, a small laughter spilled out from both of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another memory was born between the two of us, just like that time&#8230;</span></p>
