<h1>Chapter 10 - Confession, Right Hand, and Tears</h1>


<p>I was very scared.</p>
<p>But in the end, I woke up feeling that I had dreamed a dream with a happy ending.</p>

<p>“Uhh…”</p>

<p>My stomach hurts.</p>
<p>That’s strange. That must have been a dream… huh?</p>
<p>Why is it so warm?</p>

<p>“You’re finally awake.”</p>

<p>I understood the situation from that voice.</p>
<p>The warmth comes from being in close contact with someone.</p>
<p>Under the May night sky, I was being carried on someone’s back while walking on an empty path.</p>
<p>(TN: I don’t know if it was intended, but there’s this proverb, ‘April showers bring May flowers.’. Suggesting that hard work and perseverance in difficult times will eventually bring about positive results and rewards, just like the arrival of flowers in May after the rainy season in April.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>His school jacket was draped over my shoulders to prevent me from getting cold in the early summer night air.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but feel incredibly happy about his delicate consideration, and I unconsciously hugged his body tightly…</p>

<p>…wait.</p>
<p>What is this situation?</p>

<p>“W-wait a minute! Put me down!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, stop being so rough and stay put for a while. Until now, you were unconscious, you know.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“…but why are you carrying me on your back…?”</p>
<p>“There’s a hospital run by my distant relatives nearby, so let’s get you checked there.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, why not call an ambulance or take a taxi…?”</p>
<p>“I considered those options but decided against it. If they come and see an unconscious high school girl, it could potentially lead to a report being filed.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>

<p>That’s not a good situation.</p>
<p>If the police get involved, things will escalate, and it will also affect Takakura-san.</p>

<p>“We will definitely go to the hospital. I think it should be fine, but I’m worried about any potential aftereffects.”</p>
<p>“Aftereffects?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>“Don’t you remember? You were tasered with a stun gun. Did they do anything else to you?”</p>
<p>“Um… I was kicked in the stomach.”</p>
<p>“…Gee, idiot. You get injured because you act recklessly on your own.”</p>

<p>Rather than a casual remark, it was a reasonable admonishment.</p>
<p>I knew he was right, but out of habit, I found myself arguing back.</p>

<p>“Well, even you, Kagisaka-kun, were being reckless. You also almost got tasered earlier…”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t recklessness. I guided them to hold their weapon like that intentionally.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Based on Yamashiro’s attitude, I figured there was a high chance he had another weapon. So, I pretended not to notice his bluff and made him take it out.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“There’s some spare time from taking out a weapon from his pocket and taking a stance… In other words, it creates an opening. It’s easier to deal with someone who creates openings according to our predictions than with an opponent whose actions are unpredictable.”</p>
<p>“D-deal with…?”</p>
<p>“There is no one easier to beat than an opponent who thinks he has trapped his enemy and is sure of victory.”</p>

<p>…How can you think so rationally in that situation?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>While being genuinely astonished by his intelligence and composure, I ask.</p>

<p>“Are you okay? If you go rough with them, won’t those people hold a grudge against you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I asked an acquaintance to take care of the aftermath. They won’t go near any students from Aisu again. In fact, they won’t even be able to come near this area.”</p>
<p>“Wait, could it be that they’re…dead?”</p>
<p>“No, they’re not. They’ll experience something scarier than death, though. They got what they deserved, so don’t worry about it. “</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun said in his usual tone.</p>

<p>“——Hey, Kagisaka-kun, who are you exactly?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>I couldn’t help but ask him this question.</p>

<p>“First of all, how did you know my whereabouts? And who is this acquaintance of yours?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“I have so many questions! Why are you so strong? I’ve learned a bit of self-defense, so I can tell that your fighting style earlier was definitely not ordinary——”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Tomori.”</p>

<p>Although I couldn’t see his expression, Kagisaka-kun spoke with a serious voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. Absolutely not. If possible, I want you to keep my involvement in this incident a secret as well. Please don’t tell anyone that I helped Tomori.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>He told me while walking with me on his back.</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, I responded.</p>

<p>“—Alright…”</p>
<p>“Huh… You’re surprisingly easy.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you want to hide it, then it must be something you really don’t want to talk about, I guess? I’m curious, but I won’t force you to tell me anything.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought I was going to question him, but Kagisaka-kun fell silent as if surprised.</p>

<p>“You’re still as kind as ever.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>“It’s you who’s kind! You helped me again. You came to help me without even being asked to help… “</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“…Sorry, Kagisaka-kun. I’m sorry for causing trouble, really sorry.”</p>
<p>“I only helped you for my own sake. Tomori doesn’t need to apologize——”</p>
<p>“That’s not okay!”</p>

<p>Ignoring the pain in my kicked stomach, I shouted.</p>

<p>“What you just said is as true as it gets. I’m an idiot.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“The truth is… something really wonderful happened to me recently. So I thought I should try even harder on my own. That way, I can be more helpful to everyone. I thought it would bring me closer to the ideal Azusa Tomori.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Going to that karaoke place today was part of that effort. I didn’t want to put everyone in danger, and I thought I could manage on my own. But… as you can see, the result is like this… I-if Kagisaka-kun hadn’t come… I’m sure… “</p>

<p>I don’t even want to imagine what would have happened.</p>
<p>[If you keep chasing after ideals, you’ll lose your footing.]</p>

<p>—Right.</p>
<p>The advice I received during the sports festival was correct.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying so hard because I wanted Kagisaka-kun to say ‘I love you’…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>(I’m sure he hates me…)</p>

<p>And the rest of the class must be disgusted by me for acting recklessly on my own, pretending to be a hero of justice.</p>
<p>Thinking that way, I almost burst into tears.</p>

<p>“You said it was their own fault earlier, right? Those words… apply to me too. All this time, things have only been going well by chance, and all my actions might have been wrong…”</p>
<p>“… “</p>
<p>“The whole class must hate me, I’m sure. They must see me as the one who foolishly acted on my own, pretending to be a hero——”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>“Ah, yeah.”</p>

<p>In an instant response, it felt like my heart was being crushed.</p>
<p>Ahh.</p>

<p>As expected, Kagisaka-kun must hate me too…</p>

<p>“Sure, it was wrong of you to act recklessly. But, Tomori, nobody hates you.”</p>
<p>“——?”</p>

<p>‘What does that mean?’</p>
<p>With a voice that was about to mix with sobs, I asked again, and Kagisaka-kun entered a deserted park by the sidewalk.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span>
<p>He then made me sit on a bench and handed me a red-colored smartphone.</p>

<p>“It fell from Yamashiro’s pocket when he collapsed. He took it from you, didn’t he? “</p>
<p>“Yeah. But why are you giving it back now…?”</p>
<p>“Just take a look. You’ll understand the meaning of my words.”</p>

<p>As I complied and turned on the smartphone, I was left speechless by an unexpected scene.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>A tremendous number of LINE notifications were coming in.</p>
<p>There were messages from my mom and Chifuyu expressing their concern for me, but the group with the highest message count was the class group chat.</p>

<p>(…must be full of people’s dissatisfaction towards me.)</p>

<p>They might never forgive me, and I might not be able to go back to being friends with them.</p>
<p>Consumed by such fear, I still believed in Kagisaka-kun’s words and opened the class group chat with bated breath—and then I gasped.</p>

<p>【Is it true that Tomori is missing?】</p>
<p>【I’m sorry! It’s my fault for discussing that…】</p>
<p>【Please don’t apologize, Takakura-san. It was the other person’s fault.】</p>
<p>【Anyway, let’s search for Azusa-san together!】</p>
<p>【I’ll also talk to students from other classes and clubs!】</p>

<p>Those were messages from Azusa Tomori’s friends, who were worried about her.</p>

<p>【We’ll search too!】</p>
<p>【Stop it! Takakura’s boyfriend might be dangerous, right?】</p>
<p>【Girls, stay at home!】</p>
<p>【What!? Don’t say stupid things!】</p>
<p>【Do you realize how much Azusa has helped us so far?】</p>
<p>【Now it’s our turn! Let’s help Tomo-chan!】</p>

<p>“Everyone…”</p>

<p>In order to reassure my friends, I send a message saying, 【Thank you for worrying about me. I’m okay now.】</p>

<p>Immediately, at an astonishing speed,</p>
<p>【Azusa?】</p>
<p>【You’re safe!】</p>
<p>【I’m so relieved, really relieved.】</p>
<p>【Did you get injured anywhere?】</p>
<p>【Thank god… If something had happened to Azusa, I…】</p>
<p>【That’s what everyone in the class was thinking!】</p>
<p>【Yeah! Because everyone is Tomori’s friend!】</p>

<p>Voices, voices, voices, voices, voices. ( 声, 声, 声, 声, 声. )</p>
<p>(TN: “声” is a Japanese word that translates to ‘voice’. In a broader sense, “声” can also represent the power of expression, communication, and the influence that someone’s voice can have on others.)</p>

<p>The voices of everyone who is not here reach me through the connection of social media.</p>

<p>“Tomori is really well-liked., huh?”</p>

<p>But this person.</p>
<p>Although he’s not part of the class group chat, Kagisaka-kun seems to have anticipated this situation.</p>

<p>“Why… How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I just thought I would have done the same if I were in the class group chat. Everyone in the class has been helped by Tomori before. If you’re friends, a little argument won’t break your bond.”</p>

<p>Quietly. Kagisaka-kun’s left-hand touches my right hand.</p>

<p>“Indeed, your judgment today was careless, but there’s no such thing as a person who never fails. The reflection on today’s mistakes can be fixed tomorrow. It might be difficult to be alone, but with a connection to someone, it’s possible. I am sure of it.”</p>

<p>I feel the touch of his fingers on the tips of my right hand.</p>

<p>“So, you don’t have to deny all the efforts you’ve made by saying, ‘All my actions were wrong.’ You don’t have to do something so sad.”</p>

<p>His warmth.</p>

<p>“Tomori has been trying hard to resolve troubles among your friends, and many people have been saved thanks to those efforts. It’s not just the people raising their voices in the class group chat.”</p>
<p>[Thank you. I’ve always wanted to express my gratitude. Thanks to Tomori, my distrust in people has improved a little]</p>

<p>It was just about a week ago.</p>
<p>The words he told me when I held his hand for the first time resurfaced in my eardrums.</p>

<p>Thanks to that, a warmth spread in the depths of my chest.</p>
<p>But it’s not just warmth in the depths of my chest.</p>

<p>“I’m also one of the friends who was saved by Tomori. That kind of justice and righteousness you have——I love that. (sukidayo)”</p>

<p>With those words, like warming my anxious and chilled palms gently…</p>
<p>In an instant, tears spilled from my eyes. I received a call from Chifuyu, but I couldn’t answer. The tears just wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>In front of my friend, I cried for the first time.</p>

<p>“It’s not fair…”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to do with this first-time experience, so I protested as if trying to hide my agitation.</p>
<p>I weakly tapped his chest with one hand as he sat beside me.</p>

<p>“Why are you suddenly being kind, even though you always make snarky remarks?”</p>

<p>This is unfair.</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun is truly cunning in these situations.</p>

<p>He protected me tonight.</p>
<p>He let me know everyone’s voices when I was hurt.</p>
<p>He held my hand just like I did that day at the coffee shop.</p>

<p>He said he ‘loves (suki)’ me like that.</p>
<p>Of course, I know it’s not the kind of love I’ve always wanted.</p>

<p>However, my heart feels inexplicably warm, to the point where I feel it’s okay for him to see these tears.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I didn’t mean to make you cry…”</p>
<p>“That kind of way of speaking is too kind, so it’s not good.”</p>
<p>“Then what should I do…?”</p>
<p>“Let’s fight and argue like we always do, insulting and berating each other.”</p>
<p>“Don’t suddenly say things like you’re a masochist. Well, I can’t help but want to be nice. “</p>
<p>“Is that so…?”</p>
<p>“For this whole week, I thought Tomori hated me.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I was prepared for the fact that you wouldn’t talk to me again.”</p>
<p>“What!? No way!”</p>

<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What do you mean?!</p>

<p>There’s not even a milligram of a reason for me to dislike Kagisaka-kun!</p>

<p>“Well, just like Tomori made a mistake in her judgment this time, I made a mistake in my judgment too.”</p>
<p>“Misjudgment?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s what I thought. So now, I’m trying to use a method to avoid making such misunderstandings.”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun looked straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Surely, fulfilling Tomori’s wish is the best option.”</p>

<p>M-my wish…?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my breath seemed to stop.</p>

<p>With such a serious expression, he spoke.</p>

<p>“This is not like ‘me’, but I think it’s the only method.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but to stifle my breath.</p>
<p>With that level of seriousness, he said——</p>

<p>“Tomori. Tonight, with me——”</p>
