<h1>Chapter 7 - A friend is Something You Should Possess</h1>


<p>‘A friend is something you should possess.’</p>
<p>Even as a loner at school, I can relate to this phrase.</p>

<p>【Hey, Senpai!】</p>

<p>It’s past 11 p.m.</p>
<p>While I was solving a math problem set in my room, I received a DM from Kouhai-chan.</p>

<p>【Can I talk to you on a call? I have something I want to discuss.】</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>

<p>Generally, Kouhai-chan and I don’t communicate through calls.</p>
<p>It’s an important rule for maintaining this friendship.</p>

<p>【Okay.】</p>
<p>【Wow〜, it’s a rare approval from Senpai, who dislikes phone calls! Since we’re at it, how about a video call?】</p>
<p>【That’s a no-no.】</p>
<p>【Aww, I wanted to see Senpai’s face… Well, it’s fine if only my video is on, you can keep your camera off!】</p>
<p>【Well, that’s okay…】</p>
<p>【Yay, it worked!】</p>

<p>Kouhai-chan is overjoyed.</p>
<p>If Kouhai-chan is this delighted, I also want to do a video call, but it’s not possible.</p>

<p>(This call was just a way of saying thank you.)</p>

<p>Right, thanks to Kouhai-chan, I was able to overcome a crisis.</p>
<p>It happened three nights ago while we were chatting about otaku stuff through DM as usual.</p>

<p>【Oh, Senpai, I have an interesting story to tell you! It seems like my childhood friend is running a secret account.】</p>
<p>【Really?】</p>
<p>【Yep, it seems like she poured out her feelings for her crush on that secret account, and suddenly the guy started being kind to her!】</p>
<p>【 What, really?】</p>
<p>【Isn’t it interesting? It’s definitely a case of her secret account being exposed!】</p>
<p>【Well, the twist is probably that it’s not your childhood friend, but you’re talking about yourself.】</p>
<p>【Ahaha nono, my childhood friend often consults with me, so it’s credible.】</p>
<p>【I see. So what happened afterward?】</p>
<p>【I gave her advice!】</p>

<p>Kouhai-chan told me what they did.</p>

<p>To confirm if the guy was actually looking at the secret account, she intentionally uploaded an extreme selfie.</p>
<p>The next day, they would gauge the guy’s reaction to determine if the secret account was being monitored.</p>
<p>Such an outrageous plan…</p>

<p>(Maybe giving a photo of Sakura was going too far…)</p>

<p>There are risks involved in using too much information from her secret account.</p>

<p>Tomori is someone who fully embraces her romantic side on social media, but she also possesses intelligence that allows her to rank high in a prestigious school.</p>
<p>I thought that even with few clues, she would be able to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>【Hey, what happened? I’m waiting for your reply!】</p>
<p>【It’s nothing important.】</p>

<p>While replying, I checked Tomori’s secret account.</p>
<p>However, there were no strange tweets.</p>

<p>(Couldn’t you have done that?)</p>

<p>Or maybe she executed it impulsively but got scared and deleted the tweet…</p>
<p>If that’s the case, I won’t be able to see the selfie photo anymore…</p>

<p>“No, calm down.”</p>

<p>There’s still a possibility that it might be uploaded later.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, I should monitor it throughout the night…</p>
<p>No, I’ll just pretend to be a third party when she uploads the selfie and sends a warning to delete the tweet.</p>

<p>I swear that’s the only reason why I’m monitoring this account…</p>
<p>I definitely don’t want to see my classmate wearing provocative underwear in a one-shot tweet.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>That’s what happened three days ago.</p>
<p>In the end, I stayed up all night, but the selfie was never uploaded to the secret account.</p>

<p>(Good. As I expected, she must have changed her mind.)</p>

<p>Feeling a bit disappointed but determined, I resisted sleepiness and went to school on Monday.</p>
<p>However, Tomori’s behavior was strange.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she took off her tights that had a run right in front of me.</p>
<p>Although it was just putting on knee socks, she was oddly observing my reaction.</p>
<p>Then, the moment I saw her become silent at LHR during the SNS seminar, I realized.</p>

<p>This class representative is following the advice and wearing provocative underwear.</p>

<p>(Even though she’s smart enough to be suspicious that she’s being watched on her secret account, I wonder why her thinking gets dull when it comes to her own romantic situation.)</p>

<p>While having such thoughts, I reluctantly decided to help her.</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t end with just that, as various things happened after school…</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t heard the story beforehand, it could have been dangerous.”</p>

<p>When the cutest girl in the class started doing a tights strip, I glanced at it once.</p>
<p>Still, thanks to Kouhai-chan, I didn’t give in to that desire and I managed to suppress Tomori’s suspicion that I was checking her secret account.</p>

<p>【Okay, let’s make a phone call!】</p>

<p>After that DM, I received a call.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh to ease the tension.</p>
<p>Gathering my resolve, I tapped on the smartphone screen, and a voice that sounded completely different from the DM said, </p>

<p>[Long time no see, Senpai.]</p>

<p>It was a meek voice that I couldn’t associate with the person from before.</p>
<p>She was wearing a pure white dress that looked innocent. However, I had a vivid recollection of those gal-like earrings.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori’s childhood friend.</p>
<p>Kouhai-chan, also known as Kazami Chifuyu, blushed and giggled while swaying her silver hair.</p>



<p>*****</p>
<p>TN: I’m guessing the reason why Kagisaka didn’t respond to Chifuyu in Chapter 3, Part 2 was this.</p>

<p>[</p>
<p>” …….. “</p>
<p>“Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask for a while now. Why do you avoid me? Do you hate me?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that, but-“</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Ugh, fine! If you don’t want to talk, then forget it!”</p>
<p>However, I have a reason why I can’t get close to her, much to Chifuyu’s disappointment.</p>
<p>It’s not that I dislike Chifuyu.</p>
<p><strong>It’s just that it could potentially jeopardize one of my few friendships.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“It’s been a while since we talked like this, Chifuyu.”</p>

<p>I deliberately spoke in a slightly lower voice.</p>
<p>I have to do this, or there’s a chance that she’ll figure out I’m Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>

<p>“That’s true. I wanted to have more calls with you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I’m not good with phone calls. But it does feel strange? In DMs, you were so polite.”</p>
<p>“Well… then, should I use honorifics during the call?”</p>
<p>“Just kidding. It’s fine to speak casually.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>Actually, it was me who asked her to stop using polite language because it was embarrassing.</p>

<p>“Why do you use polite language in DMs, though?”</p>
<p>“Because, Senpai, you’re older. It’s better to use proper language when speaking to someone older, I guess?”</p>

<p>Chifuyu timidly asserted.</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar modesty coming from her, considering her usual demeanor.</p>

<p>Yes, Chifuyu believes that Senpai is older than her.</p>
<p>And she doesn’t realize that she’s actually having a conversation with Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>

<p>When Chifuyu and I first met, I had dyed hair, and my appearance was completely different from now, so it’s understandable that she didn’t recognize me when we reunited in high school.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>(It’s convenient for me too, as I want to avoid revealing my true identity.)</p>

<p>That’s why I try to avoid talking to Chifuyu as much as possible at school and refer to her by her last name, Kazami.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T15.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Oh, is that your casual outfit?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s clothes I wear when I go out… Does it suit me?”</p>
<p>“Well, it does.”</p>
<p>“Yay! You know, I don’t want to look like a dork in front of Senpai.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind what kind of clothes you wear.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>“I-It’s nice to hear you say that, but… It’s actually because I like you, Senpai.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I’ve said it before, but——”</p>
<p>“I know! You don’t intend to pursue romantic relationships while in high school, right? I understand that, of course. But when I’m in front of Senpai, I can’t help but want to say it,”</p>

<p>Chifuyu blushed and smiled shyly.</p>
<p>Her gesture was so cute that it almost made me regret rejecting her confession.</p>

<p>“By the way, what did you want to talk about?”</p>
<p>“R-Right, there is something that I wanted to talk about today. It’s about Azusa.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“She was Chifuyu’s childhood friend, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It seems like she’s interested in a guy now. But that guy is a troublemaker and really unpleasant. He always ignores me.”</p>
<p>“…By any chance, what’s that guy’s name?”</p>
<p>“? Kimitaka Kagisaka, but do you know him, Senpai?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Right! Of course you don’t! Why is Azusa interested in such an unimpressive guy? His taste in men is completely off. You’re so much cooler, Senpai.”</p>

<p>Let’s leave aside the fact that Chifuyu’s statement was a perfect boomerang.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is, Chifuyu doesn’t want Tomori and me to get closer.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>“Oh, let’s get back to the topic. I’ve also been wondering how I can become friends with that Kagisaka guy because, for some reason, he seems to dislike me.”</p>
<p>“You want to become friends with him?”</p>
<p>“Of course! There’s a possibility that he could become my best friend’s partner, and since Kagisaka is also an otaku, I’d be happy if I could have conversations about otaku stuff with him!”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but admire her honest statement.</p>

<p>(Chifuyu is a really good person…)</p>

<p>I feel sorry now for being distant from her at school.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>“Well, there are parts about it that annoy me, though.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Azusa has many friends, but I’m the only one who can call myself her best friend. I was the only one who was special. But when it comes to Kagisaka, she makes comments that she wouldn’t even say to me, and it somehow feels like their relationship is more special than mine…”</p>
<p>“Does it make you feel frustrated?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that! I could never say this to Kagisaka himself, but I envy him!”</p>

<p>Unaware that she was actually having a conversation with the person in question, Chifuyu was indignant.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>“Fortunately, I know everything about Azusa.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve been friends for a long time, after all.”</p>
<p>“Right, we’ve been together since our elementary school days. Here’s a secret, but I used to be a shy, bullied kid back then.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, believe it or not, I used to be a piano-playing, well-mannered girl from a musical family. Thanks to that, I was often teased by others. But…”</p>
<p>“Did your childhood friend help you?”</p>
<p>“Well, as expected of Senpai! How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I just had a feeling that she would do something like that. Isn’t Chifuyu’s childhood friend notorious for always being involved with troublemakers at school?”</p>
<p>“Yes! In that sense, she’s similar to Senpai.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Senpai, you were like that too in the past. Well, Azusa helps elite students at school, which is the complete opposite of you.”</p>

<p>That’s right, complete opposites.</p>
<p>In my case, the people I was helping were guys of my generation who had nowhere else to go.</p>

<p>“I was one of those who were saved by Senpai too. Two years ago, I had some problems and ran away from home, and fortunately, Senpai protected me.”</p>
<p>“It was just because I’m used to rough stuff.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, don’t be so modest. Well, at first, I was scared too. Senpai and the people around him all seemed too rough.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><span style="clear:both; display:block" id="ez-clearholder-leader-4"></span>
<p>“Because we were delinquents.”</p>
<p>“But you were different from just any delinquent! Everyone was strong, caring for their comrades, and cool! Especially Senpai, he was the best! I mean…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu sighed disappointingly, ‘I wish we could go back’. Then she continued,</p>

<p>“That’s because Kazarina was a team created by Senpai, right? No, Kei-senpai?”</p>

<p>She called me by an incredibly nostalgic nickname.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>It all started during middle school.</p>
<p>At that time, I would occasionally sneak out of my family’s mansion and wander the streets at night.</p>

<p>It’s because of the education policy to create individuals worthy of the Kagisaka name—A calculating relationship with his own relatives.</p>
<p>My father, who had calculated motives, never appreciated my efforts, no matter how much I achieved.</p>
<p>And I had grown tired of such things.</p>

<p>(It’s not like the night streets were lawless. But…)</p>

<p>If children were out and about late at night, they could attract the attention of delinquents who would try to extort money from them.</p>
<p>I would refuse or run away to avoid trouble, but before I knew it…</p>

<p>“——Wow, you’re amazing. I can’t believe how strong you are, man.”</p>

<p>I bought a fight that the delinquents had instigated and incapacitated them all, and that person approached me.</p>

<p>“Did you do some kind of martial arts?”</p>
<p>“It’s because of my family. I was made to learn karate and stuff.”</p>
<p>“Nice! That’s convenient!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking for a good partner. Hey, how about we team up?”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>
<p>“Let’s create a delinquent team together! We can come up with a cool name and all that!”</p>
<p>“That kind of thing isn’t popular nowadays.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, it’s the trend! You’ve heard of ‘Tokyo revengers’, right?”</p>
<p>“Tokyo… revengers…?”</p>
<p>“Huh!? You’ve got to be kidding me! Let’s stay overnight at a manga café from now on! I’ll treat you!”</p>

<p>That’s how we first met.</p>
<p>Since I had nowhere else to go, I followed along and read the delinquent manga as I was recommended.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was engrossed and moved by them.</p>
<p>Until then, I had only focused on studying and hadn’t really read any manga.</p>

<p>“Hey, wasn’t it incredibly interesting?”</p>

<p>In the early morning at the park, basking in the bright morning sun, we’re fooling around like stupid boys and discussing our thoughts on manga while holding convenience store pastries and canned coffee in our hands.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, we had formed a connection.</p>
<p>There must have been something that resonated between us.</p>

<p>“Hey, are you a middle schooler? I thought you were older, but we’re the same age.”</p>
<p>“My f*cking apologies for looking older, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s not that you look older, but mature vibe or something like that?”</p>
<p>“Is it? Maybe it’s because I’ve been dealing with a lot of adults at home.”</p>
<p>“I see. It seems there’s a lot going on… Hey, in that case, how about instead of dealing with adults, you accompany me in taking care of the kids?”</p>

<p>That’s how it started.</p>
<p>From that night on, the two of us roamed the night streets, finding other children who had nowhere to go and solving their problems.</p>

<p>Children who had run away with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Children troubled by troublesome adults.</p>
<p>Children that was threatened by a partner who said they would engage in revenge p*rn.</p>
<p>Children that wanted to protect a friend who was being extorted by Seniors.</p>

<p>(Fortunately, I had the power to resolve such troubles.)</p>

<p>Ironically, it was under the night sky where both the self-defense skills and the ability to manipulate relationships with different expressions on one’s face, which were my family lessons, were maximized.</p>

<p>“If they find out we’re middle schoolers, they might look down on us, so let’s hide our ages!”</p>

<p>By pretending to be older, I ended up being admired by peers who had their own troubles, and a natural entourage formed around me, making the work of taking care of children even easier.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, a delinquent team had been formed.</p>

<p>“We don’t really need a team name, right? It would just be tacky and superficial.”</p>
<p>“A superficial name… I like it! Let’s name the team Kazarina!”</p>
<p>“What a joke. That’s too random.”</p>
<p>“Haha, as always, you keep throwing insults at me, Kei.”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to use the name “Kagisaka,” so I didn’t reveal my real name.</p>
<p>So the nickname that person gave me ended up becoming our alias.</p>

<p>With praise from allies and fear from adversaries, my name began to spread on its own, and before I knew it, I had dyed my hair red in an attempt to look more like a delinquent.</p>
<p>I became the leader of Kazarina, the advisor for children who had nowhere to go, and sometimes the mediator who resolved seemingly hopeless situations through strategy and violence.</p>

<p>(However, this kind of life wasn’t so bad.)</p>

<p>In the school I attended at the time, just being [Kagisaka] was enough to receive special treatment.</p>
<p>It was a prestigious school, but that also made them sensitive to family background.</p>
<p>At first, I was happy with having many friends.</p>

<p>[Kimitaka is such a nerd. Why does he study so much?]</p>
<p>[Oh, here’s a secret that person told me. He wants to be recognized by his father.]</p>
<p>[Hahaha! Isn’t he a daddy’s boy?]</p>
<p>[If he wasn’t a Kagisaka, he probably wouldn’t have friends.]</p>

<p>After hearing a conversation like that one day, I grew tired of living in the prestigious school.</p>
<p>Looking back now, I realize that I had developed a distrust of people.</p>
<p>Classmates, teachers, family… In the end, they all only valued the name [Kagisaka.]</p>

<p>(That’s why life as Kazarina was ideal for me.)</p>

<p>It was a thrill I could never experience at home or in school.</p>
<p>The satisfaction of seeing my honed skills turn into someone’s smile.</p>
<p>Comrades who connected with me without ulterior motives.</p>
<p>And the best partner.</p>
<p>But…</p>

<p>“Sorry, Kei.”</p>

<p>The ideal didn’t last long.</p>

<p>I still remember it vividly.</p>
<p>The hospital room was tinted orange by the evening sun.</p>
<p>A body that was covered in pure white bandages.</p>
<p>My partner was lying on the bed with a smile that seemed filled with apologies.</p>

<p>“I can’t be with you anymore…”</p>

<p>On that day, I left Kazarina.</p>

<p>Countless member.</p>
<p>The one and only partner.</p>
<p>A shining daily life.</p>
<p>I lost everything.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Hey, Senpai!”</p>

<p>Lost in old memories, I snapped back to reality at Chifuyu’s voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, listen to me properly!”</p>

<p>While she was angry, Chifuyu seemed somewhat enjoying herself.</p>

<p>(Come to think of it, she had the same expression when we first met.)</p>

<p>It was right before I left Kazarina, back when I still dyed my hair.</p>
<p>I remember helping her when she was being bothered by college students on the streets at night.</p>

<p>[Please let me join the team too!]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>She pleaded, but she looked like a proper young lady, so I declined.</p>

<p>However, she persisted, so I reluctantly exchanged contact information with her.</p>
<p>After that, she started contacting me frequently, talking only about anime and manga.</p>

<p>I thought that if I got bored and stopped responding, she would eventually drift away.</p>

<p>[I’ve never watched anime before, but it’s really interesting! Please tell me more about the series you like, Senpai!]</p>

<p>And like that, she became more and more addicted…</p>
<p>Now she’s an important otaku friend as ‘Kouhai-chan’.</p>

<p>“It’s unrelated to Kagisaka, but recently I feel like Azusa is pushing herself too hard. What do you think I should do?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“It’s simple. Instead of taking on all the work alone, she should assign some to others.”</p>
<p>“Well, Azusa’s work involves a lot of consultations, and there are many cases that can’t be solved without her personality.”</p>
<p>“At that point, it’s bad. You know what? Listen, the key to maintaining a group is not relying on the notion of ‘this group can’t do without this person’.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Isn’t it the opposite? Like in soccer, having a star player can make a difference.”</p>
<p>“True. However, achieving results using that approach will only make the team rely more on the star player, and the team will start to revolve around the star the longer it goes.”</p>

<p>Even if you win a match with that method, it creates risks.</p>
<p>The star player becomes an ‘irreplaceable cog’ in the team.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“What if an accident occurs and the star player leaves the team?”</p>
<p>“Oh…!”</p>
<p>“The team would collapse. They wouldn’t be able to fill the hole left by the star player. That’s why it’s important to have substitutes ready for any talented individuals.”</p>
<p>“I see… So the current situation at school, where everyone relies heavily on Azusa, isn’t good.”</p>
<p>“Right. The key is not to create a fragile group that depends solely on one person’s efforts. It’s about building a strong group that prides itself on teamwork.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Senpai! You’re as sharp as ever!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu expressed her admiration while her silver hair swayed. But then her expression clouded over.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>“However, it might be difficult to delegate work. Azusa has many friends, but she’s not good at opening up to others.”</p>
<p>“Not good at opening up?”</p>
<p>“Being called [Everyone’s friend] and always solving problems alone like a hero of justice might be the reason why she’s not accustomed to relying on others. She can’t establish deep connections because of that.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s words struck a chord with me.</p>
<p>I had thought about it when I was sitting next to Tomori on the train.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>Azusa Tomori is too kind.</p>
<p>That’s why she always wants to solve any troubles by herself.</p>
<p>From her perspective, it might be a considerate act to avoid burdening others… but it worries me.</p>

<p>(Thinking that one can handle everything alone is merely an idealistic notion.)</p>

<p>Furthermore, those who believe they can handle everything alone are incredibly vulnerable.</p>
<p>Due to their overconfidence in their abilities, they may crumble if they make significant mistakes.</p>

<p>“Don’t she rely on Chifuyu either?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“Well… not really. Azusa tries to put up a front when she’s with me.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu expressed a tinge of loneliness, saying that ‘she doesn’t even try to show her weak side to me.’</p>
<p>She can’t establish deep connections even with her best friend… It’s as if she’s a lone hero.</p>

<p>“As evidence of that, Azusa has never shown tears in front of me, you know? Despite our friendship of over ten years.”</p>
<p>“If she hasn’t shown them to you, it means she hasn’t shown them to any of her friends.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she probably hasn’t shown them to anyone, not even to you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m sure it will continue like this… Oh, I have an idea! How about you become Azusa’s friend, Senpai?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“You two are similar in many ways! Plus, Senpai is experienced and reliable! I think Senpai can give Azusa good advice and support her!”</p>

<p>Indeed, Tomori and I are similar.</p>

<p>——It is natural for those with power to help others.</p>
<p>Just like how I used to think like that in the past, I believe Tomori also thinks that way.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that relying too much on oneself alone is a mistake.</p>

<p>(In that sense, maybe it’s necessary.)</p>

<p>A person who can open Tomori’s heart and establish a deep and equal connection with her… But——</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>“As a former delinquent, I don’t think I’m suitable to help a student at a prestigious school like her.”</p>
<p>“You got along with me! Besides, if we don’t mention the past, it won’t be revealed, right?”</p>

<p>Is that really the case?</p>
<p>No matter how much I hide it, the past may suddenly come to light one day.</p>
<p>If my true identity is exposed after becoming close to Tomori…</p>

<p>(She would also be inconvenienced.)</p>

<p>At that time, what would Tomori think?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>(——My relationship with her is just that of classmates, nothing more.)</p>

<p>I quietly reassure myself, a voice too small for Chifuyu to hear.</p>
<p>After ending the call with Chifuyu that night, I couldn’t bring myself to look at Tomori’s secret account.</p>
