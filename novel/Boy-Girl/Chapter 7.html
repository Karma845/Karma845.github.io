<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Morning hours are Precious</h3>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Geez, I overslept!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Far from tearing the silk, Himeko&#8217;s screams echoed through the Kirishima household in the morning</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I, who heard her voice muttered, &#8220;Honestly&#8230; &#8221;, as I was turning the eggs in a rectangular frying pan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I&#8217;m currently making Dashimaki Tamago, it&#8217;s one of my specialties,with a strong flavour of bonito flakes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a bit disappointing that I had some chopped up potherb mustard to clean out the refrigerator. However, I just ate it because it gave the dish a fun texture</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Nnn, why didn&#8217;t you wake me up?!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[No, I mean, just look at the clock]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[It&#8217;s almost 7:30!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[You can just&#8230; dash to school, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[If I dash to school&#8230; Uhm, I think I&#8217;ll manage it]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Your school is close anyway]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Himeko, who still has her sleeping habits, sticks out her tongue with a small, &#8216;tehe&#8217;.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I had my thoughts about the move. However, the fact that her school hours were greatly reduced was something she was really happy about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Onii, what&#8217;s that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[It&#8217;s my lunch. I made it from yesterday leftovers with some dashi rolls added. I found something similar to this at the school cafeteria yesterday]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I see. Moreover, where&#8217;s my part, Onii?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Alright, alright. Here&#8217;s your lunch]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[As expected from Onii, I knew you&#8217;d understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt a chill when I remembered yesterday's cafeteria problem. Well, a crowded cafeteria counts as a problem for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The way people were rushing towards the food was like soldiers in a battlefield. It must have been something usual for students in the city</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But I wasn&#8217;t trained for something like that. I didn&#8217;t have the courage to charge into the battlefield(cafeteria) every day, let alone once a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So I prepared a lunch box. I also made one for my sister since I thought that the same thing happened in her school too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(Author: fyi, Hayato had a rather caring nature)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Although we had plenty of time to spare, it wasn&#8217;t the time to relax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">After a quick breakfast and preparations, Himeko and I left the house at the same time and locked the door</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hot...]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[It&#8217;s hot...]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment we stepped outside, both Himeko and I said the same line</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike in the countryside, there was no bare ground, and the asphalt stored the heat. There were no trees to block the sun, and the early summer sun was baking my skin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike Tsukinose, the temperature in this town is extremely high during summer. Both Himeko and I walked to school together, feeling depressed from this heat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well then, I&#8217;m going this way, see you later]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ok]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I parted ways with Himeko, after quite a while, I missed the coolness on the countryside</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The number of people and the lack of greenery made me aware that I had arrived in a new place</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It&#8217;s not that I hate the idea of moving. I just need time to get used to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(Ah, speaking of which)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">As I was thinking about the countryside, I remembered something a bit bothering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the ridged flower bed a the back of the school building that had reminded him of Tsukinose</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Zucchini flowers bloom in the morning and wilt by early afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">That&#8217;s why, the only time to pollinate zucchini is at the morning</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In my mind, I saw a girl who works hard but is always in a hurry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(I wonder if she&#8217;ll be okay&#8230; )</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I went to the flower bed right after I passed the school gate</span></p>
