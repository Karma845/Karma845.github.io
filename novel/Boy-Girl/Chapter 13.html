<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; You’re No Match for Me</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break, in our usual Secret Base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was boasting about the basketball game she had with a smug look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How was my match? I’m pretty good at it, right?]</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[I guess so.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, on the other hand, had a bush look on my face and seemed as if I wasn’t listening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Haruki had observed that I was being played by feint and techniques in soccer to an interesting degree. This also made her think that I was behaving this way because I was frustrated, which made her look more confident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s not the case. If anything, it’s because I was strongly conscious of Haruki as a girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[So?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[How was the game? I didn’t see the end.]</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[It was close, but we lost. Who did Hayato root for?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She answered my question with another question. Her mischievous face clearly showed that she was playing around with Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Haruki’s body is on fire from PE, and she’s taking off not only her socks but also her summer knit, and she’s loosening up her blouse to let the wind blow in her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, it’s an incendiary sight, but at the same time, it’s a disappointing sight that she can’t show to anyone else. It was a figure she’d only show in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh well, this is Haruki-ish anyway)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I thought about it, it was kind of silly for me to be conscious of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, the wrinkles between my eyebrows loosened up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mou, Are you even listening?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, Yes. It’s my loss. I can’t beat you, Haruki.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, you finally admit it. I think you owe me one for this.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[What loan?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[To see which one of us got everyone excited?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s exciting, you’re a great actor, huh?]</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actor?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230; Haruki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the air around her changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her lightheartedness the other days were blown away and replaced by something dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face is smiling, but it’s somber. As if she’s enduring some kind of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know why she changed the atmosphere around her. What I did realize was that I stepped on a landmine and she got upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hayato… Is totally different from me.]</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Wait, Haruki?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of her smile suddenly changed, and she crawled on all fours underneath me like a beast hunting its prey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as soon as her hands touched my chest, she moved her fingers in a luscious way as if she’s checking something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s hard here… is it a muscle, or do you work out? Or is it because you’re a boy? You didn’t used to be so different from me.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[S-Stop it, Haruki!]</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do I have to say the reason?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My face was bright red from Haruki’s fingertips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soft and supple fingers traced my chest with independent movements as if they had a will of their own. Sometimes penetrating between my shirt and rubbing my bare skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way that I could withstand the unknown stimulation of my childhood friend’s fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m ticklish, stop it!]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uwaah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I forcibly push her away from me with grudges in my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, on the other hand, fluttered a couple of times, and then burst into laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Did I tickle you that bad?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Give me a break.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Because, hey… What do you think about Hayato acting like this and fooling everybody?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thanks, and I think I’m only like this in front of you.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki’s eyes narrowed, and she took out her lunch as if she’s done teasing me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took out her lunch which seemed to be the usual jelly drink she had and a rice ball. It seems to be in rotation with sandwiches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I followed her and took out my own lunch box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh yeah, how about I share a bit with you as an apology? Would you like a jelly drink? Or a rice ball?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t need it, I have my own. Haruki, you always drink that, don’t you?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s an easy way to replenish your body.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[From the convenience store?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yep, I stop by every morning. Well, Hayato always brought his own lunch. Wow, what’s that?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[This? It’s rice croquettes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my lunchbox, there were four fist-sized rice croquettes sitting on top. No other side dishes, and it was no wonder that Haruki was surprised. There was nothing else on the box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I prepared this yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sauteed chopped onion, eggplant, and bacon cut into bite sized pieces, added leftover rice, and seasoned it with salt and pepper and ketchup. Then use plastic wraps to form a tea towel-like shape, and don’t forget to put cheese inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flour, egg, and breadcrumbs are applied in their respective orders, and then rolled and deep fried on a pan with enough salad oil to soak them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Himeko told me that deep-frying rice is so calorie dense and would make her fat. But despite that, she took 3 of the croquettes with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would you like to trade me half of your rice balls?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[You sure?!]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, me too!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put half of my rice croquettes on my lunch box lid and offered it to her, and she stuffed half of her rice ball into the empty space of my lunch box as a substitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Chopsticks?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[No need, I’ll just use my hands. Mmmm,m mmm! The strong flavour is perfect for after gym, and the cheese is great! Where did you buy this? Frozen?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[I made it.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[You made it?!]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[What, are you surprised?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki made a surprised face, observed my face closely. I’m not sure what her objection is though. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it possible that you made all of this?]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yep, I did.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, seven years is a very long time, after all.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haruki&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I muttered this with somewhat troubled eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to say something to her, but I couldn’t come up with any words and choked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ok, let’s eat our lunch quickly, lunch break is almost over.]</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ok, ok.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only for a moment, but now, she immediately returned to her original, mischievous, friendly smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something was bothering me, so I looked out of the window to cover it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early summer sky was an abominable blue.</span></p>
