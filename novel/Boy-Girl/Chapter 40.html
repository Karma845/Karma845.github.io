<h3>Chapter 40 &#8211; See You Tomorrow!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the night after Haruki&#8217;s sleepover. After having dinner at Hayato&#8217;s house as usual, she went home with the lights off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She never failed to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m home,&#8221; even though she knew she wouldn&#8217;t get a reply back. It was like a kind of ritual or a habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, Haruki&#8217;s voice was just sucked into the darkness, and there was no one to blame, even though yesterday was just an unauthorized night out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Oh right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She muttered something small like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was obvious. She even laughed to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki had always hated this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a process that confirms that you’re alone after all, even if you&#8217;re a good girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today, for some reason, she felt a stirring in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remembered what happened at Hayato&#8217;s house, the place where she had just been yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Hayato and Haruki were about an hour late because she had to help out with the various committees and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Excuse me&#8230;』 [PRN: These lines were from yesterday/past]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time for her to visit alone, so she was slightly nervous and her voice trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;You&#8217;re late.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ah, welcome back.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What came back were the voices of Hayato, who seemed somewhat unhappy, and Himeko, who was lazily melting on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not a welcoming attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato, in particular, seemed to be sulking, partly because Haruki made fun of him with her photo prank that morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the reason why Haruki had done that was because she thought it was natural for her to do that since they&#8217;ve known each other for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Haruki was aware of her own mouth loosening up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Mou~, I&#8217;m sorry, Hayato. I’ll be helping you, so what should I do? What would it be today? Meat?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Shogayaki, grate that down for me. Man, I really had a rough time this morning.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[TL/N: Shogayaki means grilled ginger (Shoga = ginger, yaki = grill or fry). It was mostly paired with pork (beef is also good but pork is popular). Shogayaki is the second most popular food in Japan (first is Tonkatsu). I wish I could eat this someday.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hey, what, what? Did something interesting happen?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, it feels like Hayato really loves Hime-chan?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ehhhhh』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please give me a break&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hahaha!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Hayato was blunt and grumpy, but as they talked, he seemed to have no choice but to start laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Haruki thought about it, she had countless fights with him over the past years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;ve made up more times than she can count.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why she always finds herself smiling when she&#8217;s with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It&#8217;s been fun today.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering this, Haruki stared at the dark hallway in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what Haruki does, she can&#8217;t help but compare it to her best friend&#8217;s house from earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, she muttered quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was the same, the voice was only sucked into the darkness, the same as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same thing as usual. However, Haruki couldn&#8217;t shake the strange feeling of discomfort that had arisen within her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but she could feel a chill spreading through her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">idiculous. This is just a misunderstanding or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki told herself this as she left her bag at the door and headed directly to the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was in a good mood just this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She decided to take a hot shower to wash away her mopey mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But instead of washing away the hollow feeling that had formed in her chest, it only enhanced the feeling of a gaping hole of emptiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, she ended up taking a longer shower than usual that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing her shower, Haruki, with her hair still damp, retrieved her bag and headed back to her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This morning, she came to change into her uniform, and her summer dress that was still undressed on her bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when she saw it, she couldn’t help but remember what happened yesterday, as her chest quickly tightened up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Haruki had some thoughts about this room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Huh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I didn&#8217;t know my room was this big in the first place…</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room was still the same size as yesterday, about six tatami mats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she doesn&#8217;t know why she thought of that obvious info.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was also the discomfort that Haruki was feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling somewhat unsettled, Haruki spread out her textbooks on her desk and went through her assignments and review, as if it was her usual routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By nature, Haruki is not particularly fond of studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just came naturally to her because of the obsession that she had to do it for the sake of being a good girl&#8230; and the thought that she didn&#8217;t have to think about anything else while she was cramming her mind with studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[TL/N: Ah yes, typical Asian parents be like.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today, she felt restless even when she was at her desk. So she booted up the game console instead, or started the plastic model she was working on, but she didn&#8217;t feel like doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was something swirling in her mind that could be called emptiness or craving, something that she couldn&#8217;t seem to put into words, and she was confused by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～～～～♪</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Haruki&#8217;s phone announced a notification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of contacts that Haruki had registered was surprisingly small, so it was natural that the number of people she can get in touch with is limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki picked up her phone as if she had been playing, and quickly checked her messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Do you have any requests for tomorrow&#8217;s dinner?』[PRN: Messages through phone using this format from here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message that came was from Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s face quickly changed into a smile as she heard the words that sounded so simple, but which made her believe that she would naturally come back tomorrow. Even though it hadn&#8217;t been that long since they&#8217;d parted, she couldn&#8217;t help but want to hear his voice again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, you surprised me!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought it would be faster to talk about it. I&#8217;m fine about anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, that&#8217;s the worst part. It&#8217;s pretty hard to think of anything every day.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I see. It&#8217;s been so hot lately, so I think I&#8217;d like something light and refreshing. Also, I&#8217;ve been eating too much meat, so I&#8217;ll have fish for dinner!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Something refreshing with fish. Let&#8217;s see what I can find.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the beginning of their chatting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started talking about dinner, that morning&#8217;s prank incident, school work, how they spend their time together, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Haruki enjoyed talking about it so much that her heart was so full of joy that she forgot about time and became absorbed in it. It was as if she was filling in the gaps of seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ve got to go in, too, since Himeko said she&#8217;s finished bathing.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, it&#8217;s been so hot today, you&#8217;ll smell like sweat if you don&#8217;t go in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Right. I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow at school. Bye&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, see you tomorrow…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number 15 minutes and 23 seconds appeared on the screen of her phone after she hung up the call, indicating the duration of the call they had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 15 minutes. But 15 minutes was enough to change Haruki&#8217;s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in the past, right now she can always hear his voice and talk to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she thought about it, Haruki had noticed that the anxiety and the gaping hole in her heart that had been there until then had disappeared before she knew it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mou&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who somehow thought that it was Hayato&#8217;s fault for turning her into this state, frowned regretfully with a smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She muttered quietly into her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the smile was back right again on this maiden&#8217;s face.</span></p>
