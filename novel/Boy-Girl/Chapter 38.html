<h3>Chapter 38 &#8211; You&#039;re only going back to your former self in front of me. No, wait! </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmmm&#8230; Yeah? And yes, it was&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato woke up at the same time as usual, in a different room, feeling uncomfortable. His neck and back ached a little, because he slept on an unfamiliar sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he slowly stretched and looked around, he noticed a stack of books on the dining room table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for yesterday. I&#8217;m going back to get a change of clothes. Also, please forget about last night. Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last part of the letter is written in a strong, punching style, which reveals Haruki&#8217;s state of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to it was the neatly folded T-shirt that Haruki had been wearing, and as he picked it up, He could smell the slightly faint sweet lingering scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should&#8217;ve at least eaten breakfast here before you leave&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was somewhat embarrassed by the scent of someone else other than himself, and muttered something like that as an excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there was no proof, Hayato breathed a sigh of relief because he felt that Haruki was already fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, let&#8217;s get things ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday mornings are always busy, and somewhat depressing. But there are many things to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to take out the trash, prepare for school, prepare breakfast, and make lunch. Hayato did all of these things with ease and without a care in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he didn&#8217;t, he would remember the embarrassing line he had said to Haruki last night, and he would be in agony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fu~aah. Good morning, Onii. Where&#8217;s Haru-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’d got to get ready for school, so she went back home first. Himeko, go wash your face. You have a bad sleeping habit. I&#8217;ll prepare breakfast in the meantime.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, it&#8217;s exploding&#8230;. Hmm? Onii, what happened to your neck?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My neck? Uhm, I had a little trouble sleeping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I mean, there, on the right side, it&#8217;s red.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On the right? But it&#8217;s the left side that hurts… Himeko?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was having a conversation with Himeko, who had just woken up, Hayato suddenly felt a tug on the shirt on his back as he was cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he turned around to see what was going on, he was greeted by Haruki&#8217;s face, which looked a little sad, yet as if she was forcing a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Haru-chan, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Himeko also had some thoughts about Haruki&#8217;s behaviour last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe she knows what&#8217;s going on to some extent from the communication on her phone. Even so, this expression meant that Himeko, like Hayato, may not be able to step in from the refrain of the seven-year gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hayato had one thing he could say for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s because I-we, have friends on our side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Pfft! Hahaha!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, shut up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s eyes fluttered, and then she suddenly erupted and swore. But then her face turned into a smile. [PRN: Raws said Himeko, but I feel like it should be Hayato.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu&#8230; but that’s right. I&#8217;ll have to work hard too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was also caught by Himeko and overflowed with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was clearer and bluer than usual after the rain had ended last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early morning sun of early summer burned Hayato&#8217;s skin as he walked to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s&#8230; but after the rain&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain. A blessing from heaven. As it is called upon, crops will grow rapidly after rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s not all good. If it rains as hard as it did last night, there’s a risk of the crop rows collapsing, or of the fruit bursting from the sudden moisture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the promise made the other day, his feet naturally went to the flower bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good morning. Looks like a good harvest, huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, Kirishima-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the outskirts of the school building, there was a small girl with curly hair, Minamo Mitake, who was busily harvesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to last night&#8217;s rain and this morning&#8217;s weather, many of the vegetables she planted are bearing fruit. There were two small cardboard boxes nearby, which were already mostly filled. The soil that had been washed away by the rain had been re-collected, suggesting that she had already taken care of it very early on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to say I&#8217;ll help you out, but I think you&#8217;re already done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to you, I got a lot! But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, maybe you&#8217;ve got too much?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake smiled with a troubled look on her face. There were so many vegetables piled up on the cardboard that even if Hayato split them up, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to consume them all. In particular, there were a lot of eggplants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word &#8220;bountiful harvest and poverty&#8221; passed through Hayato&#8217;s mind. In the countryside of Tsukinose, it is not unusual to have too much produce and be forced to share it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can share the tomatoes with you at grandpa&#8217;s place, but eggplants are&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try marinating it overnight? In the countryside where I used to live, they used to serve it as a snack.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TL/N: I also tried this and it’s delicious. Since eggplants are prone to spoiling (same goes with tomatoes). Just grill it using oil. After grilling, mix it with spices (salt, pepper, chilis, garlic) and put it in a jar. You can preserve it for up to 1-2 weeks.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, how do you do that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a picture of how to make it and send it to you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh! You bought it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Then Hayato exchanged his contact ID with Mitake Minato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Did I manage to say it in a natural way?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he tried to make it sound casual, Hayato was quite nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Haruki and Himeko, he had only known her (Mitake) for a short time, and she was a girl. Hayato had simulated it in his mind several times, and he was relieved that he was able to fulfil his promise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to Hayato&#8217;s face, he noticed that Minamo Mitake was blushing and looking up at him with a somewhat apologetic expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, um, was it okay with me and that&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? What&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, um… Your girlfriend…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Girlfriend?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato tilted his head at the unexpected word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he followed Minamo Mitake&#8217;s gaze to see what was going on, he saw that it was on the right side of her neck. This is what Himeko had pointed out to him this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, this. My sister pointed it out to me. Is it that obvious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s good to see you guys getting along! But the kiss mark is&#8230;. Hauuu!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ED/N: I knew it, I f*cking knew it!! oooooouuuggghhhhhhhh!!!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mi-Mitake-san?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With some serious misunderstanding and misinterpretation, Minamo Mitake ran off with a blushing face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato, who was left behind with the harvested vegetables, was at a loss as to what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be taking care of the vegetables, while my neck is just a bug bite.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　The first message Hayato typed on his phone was such an awkward excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he approached the classroom, the only thing that came to Hayato&#8217;s mind was Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His former best friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A childhood friend who made scratches together and played with muddy clothes. They were childhood friends who swore to be friends forever, accumulating each other&#8217;s loans and memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when they met again, they were far removed from their former selves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they were side by side, one head taller than the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hands that held them together were at a full turn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speed at which they ran was the same, but the difference can be seen in their stride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her short hair was long and shiny, her scratched skin was white and smooth without a single blemish, and the dress she wore yesterday was so fashionable and pretty that it could never be stained with mud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were times when Hayato was flustered and dismayed. It was only natural that she had become such an attractive girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, once they hang out together, they can share the same feelings of fun as what they did back then, and Hayato still feels that she’s an irreplaceable partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he’s the dull transfer student and she’s the neat, dainty, popular girl at school, it&#8217;s&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good morning… Uhmm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Kirishima! What&#8217;s wrong with your neck?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that it&#8217;s a kiss mark. Unfortunately, someone said it&#8217;s an insect bite but&#8230; What is that? That’s a rare sight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve never seen Nikaido like that before either.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he entered the classroom, Hayato&#8217;s eyes caught sight of Haruki in her seat, surrounded by everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That much could be said to be the usual scene. But this morning, Haruki was actively talking to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the one I picked out with Hime-chan, and here&#8217;s the one I picked out with her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, very cute!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I like how you dress in different outfits.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are a few weird ones in there that are obviously tacky, but it&#8217;s like they&#8217;re playing around with them too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Duh, lame&#8230;ah, haha&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki Nikaido is a popular person. Her appearance and demeanour can make her something of an idol of sorts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you leave her alone, she will be surrounded by people in no time and talk to them, and it&#8217;s almost impossible for her to talk to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Haruki is proudly showing off the screen of her phone, it&#8217;s hard not to stand out and take an interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230;You talk to other people like that, don&#8217;t you?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hayato saw that Haruki was in a state of buoyancy, he felt something inexplicable pass through his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a picture of my childhood friend. I went shopping to buy clothes together on the weekend.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Heh, heh.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, your reaction is weak, Kirishima! Her childhood friend is also a beautiful girl, but you know what? Nikaido-san&#8217;s casual clothes are in that picture! I want to see it, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Mori was excitedly making a strong argument, Hayato&#8217;s reaction wasn’t so positive. It was easy to imagine Haruki in yesterday&#8217;s outfit, but also in his own clothes, and the said childhood friend in the picture was his own sister, whom she had known since birth. The only thing he can do is that he can&#8217;t help but smile bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the sight of Haruki happily telling everyone about his childhood friend Himeko seemed like a positive change, as if some of the barriers she had built around her had been broken down. Hayato tried to think of it as a positive change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the tears of last night had triggered some kind of positive change in Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good thing for Haruki.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">」</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; he thought as he made his way to his seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good morning, Nikaido-san&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, good morning, Kirishima-kun…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re a popular guy this morning, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Would you like to see it, Kirishima-kun? It&#8217;s a picture of my childhood friend. Here it is, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s well taken?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki then appealed to him to show her the screen of her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The childhood friend of Nikaido Haruki whom she’s boasting about&#8230; is none other than Himeko. If Hayato were to ask why she was enjoying the image of his sister that he was so used to seeing, only Haruki would know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the bewildered feelings he had just experienced, he became curt. He ended up with an unfriendly attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Haruki was persistently pushing her phone towards him. To the casual observer, it looked like she was trying to show off her precious childhood friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not really&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyaa!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Hayato saw the screen, he unintentionally snatched the phone from Haruki&#8217;s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Haruki&#8217;s adorable surprise echoed around her, and everyone rolled their eyes at Hayato&#8217;s sudden action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What in the world did the people around him think Hayato was thinking when he saw Nikaido Haruki&#8217;s childhood friend now &#8211; he didn’t care about it since he was struck by such surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, wait, wait, wait, this is&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How&#8217;s that? Isn&#8217;t that a good shot? She&#8217;s my dearest childhood friend…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The picture was a selfie of Haruki wearing Hayato&#8217;s uniform shirt and crawling with her lips on his neck while he was on his arm pillow. He’s not sure if it&#8217;s an incentive or not, but the words &#8220;Hayato is sleeping next to me&#8221; are also dancing on it. Apparently, this was the cause of the congestion on his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Haruki in front of him smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s not the neat, graceful smile you see in front of everyone, it&#8217;s the somewhat mischievous smile he’s been used to seeing since they were a child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, many things ran through Hayato&#8217;s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t know what had happened in the last seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s sure it&#8217;s not something that can be easily said yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he’s sure she&#8217;ll tell him that when this void is filled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh well, we&#8217;ll always be friends, Haruki!』 [PRN: A line of the past btw]</span></p>

<img src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c38.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The small promises they’ve made in the past are still alive and well today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Hayato now had a feeling in his heart that he wanted to say out loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-&#8230;&#8230;Nikaido&#8230;.!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mmm-hmm?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;You&#8217;re just going back to your former self in front of me. No, wait!</span></p>
