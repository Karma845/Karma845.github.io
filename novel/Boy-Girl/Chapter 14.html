<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Hayato, you jerk!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day after school, I was in a nearby supermarket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In there, I heard a voice that sounded familiar, which I had been getting used to hearing lately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yo&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What came out of my mouth was an unpleasant reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I was exposing a side of me that I didn’t want to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was hunched over in one of the corners selling stationery and toys, looking around absentmindedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Buying a toy?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, no. I mean, this is&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already a sight to behold if examined carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put each item in my hand and shook it to see if I could find what I was looking for, or pressed my finger on top of the box to see if I could find anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it&#8217;s not even Haruki who misses such interesting things. Her face made a nice smile, like a child who has found an interesting toy. It was me who panicked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, what a coincidence! It’s rare for me to run into you outside of school, or maybe you’re on your way home from school in your uniform?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmmm, dinosaur fossils and mineral gemstones… Oh, Hayato likes to collect unusual rocks and stones?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh yeah, I was in the middle of shopping! I’m supposed to buy something and get home&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I made a diorama of a Showa-era candy store.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Really?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, really. Look at this.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Haruki showed me the screen of her phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the screen was a small wooden shack that looked like a store, with a Coke sign, vending machines, gacha machines, an ice cream freezer, and even an insect net.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a true Showa retro picture of a candy store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is Murao’s grandmother’s store!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, I made it while I was still remembering how it looks.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s amazing, even the ground and the wood… How did you do it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You can buy those from the 100-yen store. You can find everything from boards, stone powder, color powder, to tools like glue, tape, and brushes.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wow, the 100-yen store! I didn’t know they really existed, or that it wasn’t an urban legend.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even though there’s one in front of the station?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah well, I mean, yeah… But you can really make these things with plastic toys, huh&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wanted an ice cream freezer, but all I got was a bunch of benches, and I wondered what the odds were…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm, Haruki-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highlight of her eyes fades along with a sigh, and she has a vacant expression. But her mouth is in the shape of a smile. This is clearly not an ordinary view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I instinctively had a vision of myself being dragged down the rabbit hole. I felt a chill run down my spine. I gently put the toy back on its shelf. (T/N: Rabbit hole as in getting hooked past the point of no return)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong? Aren’t you going to buy it? Isn’t this country festival/food stall series really tempting?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Alright, alright, shopping! Let’s go back to shopping, Haruki!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, A shogun toy!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I forcefully pushed Haruki, the rabbit hole dweller, away from the toy section.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The toy section is a rabbit hole; I made a deep mental note of that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, we finished our shopping quickly and left the store. Somehow, we were even more tired than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh, that was a close one, I almost fell down a new rabbit hole.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Moderation is key. Hmm?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My bags are not very large.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the chicken, konjak, and burdock that I needed for tonight chikuzen-ni, there was only the salmon fillet that I needed for the main course. It was enough for even a small child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, on the other hand, had bought so much that her hands were full. She fidgeted with her bags several times and looked like she was having trouble walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was natural of me to lend her a hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here, give me that, it’s pretty heavy.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ha-Hayato?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm? You can bring the rest yourself, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh… Ah, yes.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m freezing here, let’s start moving.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I half-heartedly, but in a natural way, took Haruki’s luggage and urged her to go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was both surprised and terribly confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(There have been people who have tried to help me with my luggage at school. However, there was always an ulterior motive or calculation. I’ve never had anyone treat me like Hayato today. He just reached out to me because I’m in trouble.) (T/N: This is Haruki speaking)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in fact, Hayato didn’t have such a way of thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he were to overlook someone in need of luggage help like Haruki in Tsukinose, he’d immediately become gossip that would be spread throughout the entire village. That’s the scary thing about the countryside. It’s just a habit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Haruki, this was not the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the first time she experienced this, and her chest filled with a mixture of surprise, joy, confusion, and doubt. All the emotions made her conscious of Hayato.., and no matter what she does, it makes her conscious of Hayato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, do you always buy this much?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, uhm… I buy a lot of stuff at once.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><b>Haruki POV:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s where the conversation ends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We stand shoulder to shoulder in silence, just as we did in the past. I occasionally glance at Hayato’s face, which is now separated by only one head from mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hayato just walks without paying attention to me. The same as usual, I even felt like hating him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to say something to Hayato, but I felt like I could just leave it at that. I walked down the road at dusk with such feelings. All I could hear was the sound of our footsteps. But it’s strangely uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well, it’s Hayato after all)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I arrived at my house, which wasn’t lit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past 7 years, there has been no one to greet me… it’s a dark house. It was strange to return here with Hayato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here we are. Where do you want me to put it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll unlock the door, you can leave it in front of the door.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Okay, well then. I’m leaving.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, wait!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, never mind. Well…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a spur-of-a-moment comment. It wasn’t a conscious word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because of this, my feelings were mixed up, which made me upset for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Number! Yes! Give me your phone number or something! We haven’t exchanged contact information yet, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, right… Sorry.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to hide my worry, but the words that came back to me made my head spin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t expected to be rejected. My head began to refuse to comprehend the situation, and the loneliness that had been locked away in the back of my mind came out. My heart racked as if it was going to burst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the illusion that something important was slipping away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I actually don’t have a smartphone&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hayato, you jerk!!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scream that came from relief was extremely loud.</span></p>
