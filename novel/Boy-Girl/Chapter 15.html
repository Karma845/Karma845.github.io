<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; If I had that&#8230;</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was raining this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been raining since last night, and the continuous rain had created a gloomy atmosphere. It would be rare for anyone to want to go to work or school on such a day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh! My hair is all messed up!] (EDN: MC’s sister)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kirishima Family also raised their voices in protest against such an atmosphere in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was making lunch with Himeko’s voice as the BGM. She was saying [Ahh… It’s always like this&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lunch consisted of frozen karaage (the microwavable type), leftover burdock root, and carrot kinpira from last night’s dinner, and small tomatoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I hate rainy days! It made my hair get all puffy and floppy.] (EDN: MC’s sister)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I like it a lot, actually. I don’t have to worry about being sent to help out.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Onii, there are no fields here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, you’re right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[More importantly, according to the app, it’s supposed to stop raining in the afternoon. I wonder if I should take a folded umbrella.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From your phone?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, it’s pretty handy.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, well it is convenient.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m surprised that Onii is interested.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230; Well, Haruki asked me why I didn’t have one.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Haru-chan&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko nodded her head and crossed her arms as if she was convinced of something. At the same time, her eyes were staring at me with a hint of criticism and dismay in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can I have a word with you, Onii? A phone is now a necessity in today’s world. Just as every family has a refrigerator and every farmer has a tractor, it is natural for everyone to have one. The ones who don&#8217;t have them are abnormal nowadays.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Seriously… Is it really that bad?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tsukinose only has one radio wave, But it’s still convenient to have it. I call Saki-chan everyday, you know&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, with Murao-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saki Murao. Something that’s quite rare in Tsukinose, a girl in the same age as Himeko, and is a classmate and a friend of hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a quiet girl and has been playing with Himeko for a long time. However, when I approached her, she always hid behind Himeko, so she is perceived as a friend of my sister who’s really shy. Yet, she is a really important friend of Himeko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I see&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko and Saki Murao were separated by our move. The distance between Tsukinose and this town is several hours by car. It’s not a distance where they can easily meet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me and Himeko, who don’t have a driver license nor a car, there’s a gap that would require a whole day to visit them. For a young child like Himeko, it would be an eternal separation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Himeko is still actively keeping in touch with her. It may be a faint connection from a palm-sized device. However, I felt that they were deeply connected and still communicating with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see… Murao-san, how is she?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm… The usual? Ah, but it seems that she’s a bit concerned about you, Onii… What did you do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ha? Me? Well, I mean, Murao-san was rather uncomfortable with me, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Right? Hmmm… She’s always been weird when she’s in front of you, Onii… I wonder if it’s psychological?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stop it, Himeko. That hurts, you know.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahaha, I’ll say something nice about your appeal to her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll count on you for that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Himeko started typing a message to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw this and thought that if I had stayed connected to Haruki when I was a child, I might have had a different future than I have now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko said something to me while typing a message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think Haru-chan was happy to see you again after such a long time. You’re still friends, right? I’m sure you have tons of things to talk about, and I think you want to talk more.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know… But that might be true.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, Hayato doesn’t know why Haruki yelled at him like that yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I think about it, there are many things I don’t know nor understand about Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’re a lot of things I didn’t know about Haruki, like the fact that she’s a girl, or that she was building a diorama. There might be misunderstandings and miscommunication between us. Even so, Haruki is a special and important childhood friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(If we had a smartphone, we’d be able to understand each other.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was considering getting a smartphone.</span></p>
