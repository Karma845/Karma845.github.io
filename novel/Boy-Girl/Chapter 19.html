<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Only Child</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　On the dining table of the Kirishima family, Haruki was vigorously chewing on a bowl of ratatouille pasta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, it&#8217;s so good! It&#8217;s so delicious that it&#8217;s frustrating! Even though he’s just Hayato!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right? He&#8217;s too good at cooking, so I can&#8217;t improve my cooking skills.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t &#8216;I know&#8217; me, Haruki. And I&#8217;ll remember that, Himeko.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki told them that she had come to the convenience store to buy some food, so Himeko invited her instead to join them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　It was as if she couldn&#8217;t stand to be in front of the convenience store after shouting so loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Hayato&#8217;s mouth loosened up when he saw Haruki eating so well, even though she was swearing in some way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was so delicious, thanks for the food! I even had a second serving! It&#8217;s Hayato&#8217;s fault if I get fat from this!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His cooking is delicious, but he always makes things that make me want to eat more&#8230; This is the enemy of women.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, the enemy of women.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right?&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right~&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Heeee~&#8230;&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki and Himeko nodded to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Although it had been a long time since they had seen each other, they didn&#8217;t feel like they had been apart for a long time and started talking like long-time friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　For whatever it&#8217;s worth, Himeko and Haruki are two of the few children of the same age in Tsukinose, and they often play together, following Hayato&#8217;s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　The bond that they shared at that time is still alive and well between Haruki and Himeko― even if the time and distance of seven years had separated them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even so, Haru-chan, you&#8217;ve become an incredibly beautiful girl. I didn&#8217;t notice it at all at first, I was so surprised.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, my mimicry is quite good, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I was totally fooled! I thought you were a boy, you know. Onii even said you haven&#8217;t changed at all, in fact he said you&#8217;ve become more aggressive, from a monkey to a gorilla.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm~, Hayato~?&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Woops, I forgot that I still have to wash the dishes.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You owe me!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki&#8217;s stare made Hayato feel terrible and he hurriedly ran to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　He had made it clear that he, like Himeko, thought Haruki was a boy back then. Feeling uncomfortable, Hayato washed the dishes to cover it up. Haruki and Himeko looked at each other and laughed at the back of Hayato&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Hime-chan?&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just like you said, Haru-chan is Haru-chan after all. I don&#8217;t know how to put it, but&#8230;&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s with that? But I see, that&#8217;s what Hayato said too&#8230;&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That reminds me, Haru-chan, let&#8217;s exchange contact information. Unlike Onii, I have a smart phone. Yes, unlike Onii~.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes, let&#8217;s exchange! I knew Hayato was weird for not having one.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know, Onii had always been―&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true, Hayato had always―&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki and Himeko, two girls who have known each other since childhood, got excited about the topic of Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　They talk about the country and the city, blank memories, the past seven years, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Time flies when you&#8217;re having fun, and the night goes by with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, I really should go home soon&#8230; Hey, where&#8217;s auntie and uncle?&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, they&#8217;re late again today.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Well, sorry to bother you.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, please contact me, Haru-chan.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　It was a little after 9:00 p.m. and Haruki wondered if she had overstayed her welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Not just only Haruki and Himeko showing their painful reluctance, but also Hayato too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―I&#8217;ll take you home.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato?&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki, and even Hayato himself, were both taken aback by the sudden offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Hayato didn’t know why he said that. Both Haruki and Hayato had dumbfounded looks on their faces, meanwhile Himeko was impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, Onii, make sure you send her home safely, okay? Haru-chan is so cute to be left alone.&#8221; (Himeko)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ueh!? U-Umm, it&#8217;s fine! It&#8217;s only a short run away, so I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you know&#8230; this is a great opportunity to make a loan.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Hayato!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Hayato goes out of his own way to make such excuses, and Haruki follows him out of the Kirishima house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good grief, you owe me so much, mou~!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　She was swearing, but her face looked happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Unlike the road to the convenience store on the main street, the residential area where Haruki&#8217;s house was located was less crowded with people and cars. Because of this, only a few houses in the area were lit up with the lights of life. It seemed to be a time of reunion for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　On such a street, Hayato and Haruki walked shoulder to shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　It was a strange feeling for both of them. But it wasn&#8217;t a bad feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, you know&#8230;&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hime-chan, she&#8217;s gotten prettier.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, did she? I’m not sure about that.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How nice, I wish I had a little sister or brother like that.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that good, you know? You have to wake her up a lot, she&#8217;s got a big attitude, she&#8217;s selfish, she&#8217;s got a TV in the living room that she refuses to give up.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just like Hime-chan that I can easily imagine her like that.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right?&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But still― oh, here we are.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　He&#8217;s been to Haruki&#8217;s house several times. It&#8217;s an ordinary house, but the lights are off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　But for some reason, just because the lights were not on, it seemed distorted to Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m a little jealous that Hayato has Hime-chan and Hime-chan has Hayato.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki&#8230;?&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　As she said this, Haruki took the key out of her pocket, as if she didn&#8217;t feel anything at all, and was sucked into the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m an only child, you know.&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Haruki turned around, smiling a little sadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Hayato wanted to say something― but he couldn&#8217;t find anything to say to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good night then Hayato, I&#8217;ll see you later!&#8221; (Haruki)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah, see you later Haruki.&#8221; (Hayato)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　The door was closed with a special emphasis on &#8220;See you later&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　This left him with a feeling of incomprehension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Hayato scratched his head with the hand he had raised to say goodbye.</span></p>
