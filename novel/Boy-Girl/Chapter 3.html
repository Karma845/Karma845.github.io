<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; It's a Secret</h3>

<p>As expected, I was getting tired of being surrounded by people since morning</p><p>(I&#8217;m feeling that this classroom has become a festival-like place since morning)</p>
<p>&#12288;&#12539;&#12539;&#12539;</p>
<p>One of my classmates invited me to join him for lunch, but I said no and slipped out of the classroom to go for a walk and buy something on the store</p>
<p>[Ugh...]</p>
<p>I arrived at the store a little later than than the others, but the crowd was at its peak, and I flinched at the incomparable hustle and bustle of my classroom</p>
<p>(From now on, I&#8217;d better bring my own lunch)</p>
<p>I let out a sigh as I looked at the margarine cobbler I managed to get my hands on</p>
<p>It looks bland and tasteless, but fortunately, for a growing kid like me, the portion is large</p>
<p>I wanted to eat lunch in a place where no one is around, so I wandered around school looking for a place where I could be alone</p>
<p>However, such place is really hard to find</p>
<p>I even went to the back of the school building, but there was a female student there that I didn&#8217;t know</p>
<p>[Hmm, Is that?]</p>
<p>I was about to leave, but then, I spotted something familiar. Something you won&#8217;t see in the city, that&#8217;s why it caught my interest</p>
<p>A petite schoolgirl with frizzy hair who was crouching in front of me was also looking at the thing</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to approach that girl</p>

<p>[Ugh, the fruit doesn&#8217;t grow well&#8230; I wonder if the fertilizer is bad? or-]</p>
<p>[Is that a zucchini?]</p>
<p>[Oh my God!]</p>
<p>[Oh, sorry to scare you. But those yellow flowers are zucchini, aren&#8217;t they? The purple one next to it is eggplant, and the white one is shishito&#8230; There&#8217;s also corn, right?]</p>
<p>[Eh? Yes! Yep, that&#8217;s right!]</p>


<p>The place was a flower bed</p>
<p>It is surrounded by a long and narrow brick wall, but somehow the soil has been heaped up toward the center to create ridges, where vegetables are planted</p>
<p>Usually, I&#8217;m not the type of person who actively speaks to girls at their first meeting</p>
<p>In fact, I didn&#8217;t know what to talk about, and if I hadn&#8217;t had the need to talk to someone like Nikaido-san, I would&#8217;ve passed by</p>
<p>But this time, I couldn&#8217;t help but call out to her</p>

<p>[Are you pollinating? Zucchini won&#8217;t grow if you don&#8217;t pollinate the female flowers, you know]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[Eggplants will produce more if you cut off the excess flower and shishito peppers if you remove some of the branches]</p>
<p>[Ohh...]</p>
<p>When I pointed out the problem, the female student hurriedly took out her notebook from her skirt pocket and flipped through it.</p><p>Her eyes flick back and forth between the flowers bed and the notebook, and her face turns red</p>
<p>Incidentally, my knowledge is of the level that even a child who helps out in the fields in the countryside would know. So it&#8217;s nothing worth to brag about</p>
<p>[You know a lot, don&#8217;t you?]</p>
<p>[I used to work in the fields in the countryside. Is this a gardening club or something?]</p>
<p>[Ah, yes. This is the gardening club]</p>
<p>[You grow vegetables&#8230; for a gardening club?]</p>
<p>[That&#8230; as expected, this is weird, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>
<p>[Nope, it&#8217;s perfectly fine, Tomatoes are used to be ornamental, and I like vegetables flower, too]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>In fact, I was more familiar with vegetable flowers rather than the flowers in the flower shop</p>
<p>(Also, I used to get some money if I helped out in the fields)</p>
<p>When I smiled and replied with such thought, the girl&#8217;s eyes fluttered in panic, as if my reply was unexpected&#12288;</p>
<p>Her appearance was somewhat like a small animal.</p>
<p>[.... What are you doing?]</p>
<p>A voice that sounded like a bell was heard from my back</p>
<p>But&#8230; the tone of the voice had a hint of dismay in it</p>
<p>[Ah, Nikaido-san]</p>
<p>[Mitake-san, the fertilizer you applied for has arrived at the club building]</p>
<p>[Eh? Ah, thanks for the info, Nikaido-san. I&#8217;m on my way then]</p>
<p>The owner of the previous voice was Nikaido-san, the girl who was sitting next to me</p>
<p>After hearing Nikaido-san&#8217;s story, she ran out to the club building as fast as she could</p>
<p>After Mitake-san left the gardening area, Nikaido-san puts her hands on her hips, stares at me with her eyes, and bring her face closer to me</p>

<p>[Hmmm&#8230;. Picking up girls on your first day at your new school? I wonder if that&#8217;s your type of girl, Kirishima-kun!]</p>
<p>[No no, that&#8217;s not it]</p>
<p>When I see her very pretty face close to mine, I feel a sense of dread. Not only that, she also had a strange aura that made me back away</p>
<p>Her familiar words and attitude, it was as if she had thrown away a face that she&#8217;s been keeping for years</p>
<p>[I didn&#8217;t mean to pick on you but, we looked similar]</p>
<p>[Similar? With who?]</p>
<p>[My grandpa and his sheep]</p>
<p>[Ahhh, Those sheep that we started to raise them to eat weeds, but they were always interested in the vegetable plants and start eating them]</p>
<p>[Yep yep, when I saw them with their curly hair while wandering around the vegetables are---]</p>
<p>[Pfft, Hahahahaha!]</p>
<p>She burst into laughter after she heard my answer</p><p>After that, she slaps me on my back&#12288;</p>
<p>[Honestly, what a horrible person you aren&#8217;t you, Hayato? Asking me out because I looked like one of your sheep]</p>
<p>[Oi! Take it easy on me, won&#8217;t you, Haru&#8230; ki?]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why those words came out of my mouth. The last word was a completely questionable</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I said such thing</p>
<p>I stare at her intensely</p>
<p>[Ah, Nikaido-san, here I am. Do you have a minute?]</p><p>[Yes, what is it?]</p><p>[Wa-! OI!]</p>
<p>Someone from my school called her out</p><p>But right after she got called out, she returned to her usual expression and speaking tone</p>
<p>[Shhh...!]</p>
<p>She turned to me as she left, putting her index finger on her lips and smiled wickedly</p>
<p>[What the hell was that?]</p>
<p>Various of questions ran through my mind at once, and after that, my chest feels heavy</p>
