<h1>Chapter 3 - Vibrant Lunchtime</h1>


<p>Azusa Tomori has a secret social media account.</p>
<p>Moreover, she uses it to pour out her feelings for her classmates.</p>

<p>Naturally, I have some questions.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s the obvious one regarding why she fell in love with a guy like me, but there are other questions as well.</p>

<p>① Why doesn’t she confess directly instead of expressing her feelings on a secret account?</p>
<p>② Why does she even have a secret account in the first place?</p>

<p>Those two things caught my attention, but I won’t ask her directly.</p>
<p>At school, I don’t make connections with others.</p>

<p>A few days ago in the library, we ended up engrossed in a ‘Kimi Hana’ talk for a good 30 minutes, interspersed with our usual banter. But I haven’t forgotten my rules.</p>
<p>So our relationship shouldn’t change… or so I thought.</p>

<p>“Let’s have lunch, Azusa… uh?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Kagisaka-san?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Do you need something from us?”</p>

<p>Amidst the bustle of lunch break, something was quietly unfolding.</p>

<p>In front of me were three students who were particularly close to Tomori.</p>
<p>And Tomori, who was standing next to me, had her usual charming smile.</p>

<p>“I called him. Today, I thought it’d be nice if Kagisaka-kun could join us for lunch.”</p>

<p>Instantly, the whole class went into an uproar.</p>

<p>“Wait what?! Tomo-chan invited Kagisaka!”</p>
<p>“Has she finally snapped off because he’s slacking off too much?”</p>
<p>“A public trial. Kazami and the others will be the jury. He’ll be sentenced death penalty and sent straight to hell!”</p>
<p>“Nah, even if he got the death penalty, being able to hang out with those four is like heaven.”</p>

<p>Astonishment poured out from everyone, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>And there were envy-filled gazes directed at me as well.</p>

<p>And it’s no wonder.</p>
<p>Other than me, the four of them are not only at the top of the class hierarchy but also at the school hierarchy.</p>

<p>[Senpai, what are you up to?]</p>
<p>[I got invited by the people in my class I’m not close with!.]</p>
<p>[Seriously? Senpai is surprisingly socially awkward, so if anything happens, please don’t hesitate to DM me!]</p>

<p>While appreciating the encouraging DM from Kouhai-chan, let me introduce today’s impromptu lunch gathering members here.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Kagisaka-kun.”</p>

<p>Warmly welcoming me was Tsubasa Homura.</p>
<p>With a face that could easily convince anyone that he was a young rising actor, he towers over 180cm tall with brownish hair and speaks in a refreshing and gentle manner, akin to a soda drink on a summer day.</p>
<p>His nickname is Tsubacchi.</p>
<p>He’s a handsome guy, as far as anyone can see.</p>

<p>“We usually eat together as a group of four, but I’m the only guy.”</p>

<p>As Homura happily welcomes me. It’s true that normally he spends lunchtime with three girls.</p>

<p>――What’s with that harem romantic comedy life? I hope he’ll sink into Tokyo Bay right now.</p>
<p>But there are hardly any guys who feel jealous like that.</p>
<p>Instead, he’s praised as a super nice guy deserving of [It’s understandable if it’s Homura.]</p>

<p>“I’m saying this as someone who was in the same class last year, so there’s no doubt about it..”</p>
<p>“Huh? Did you say something?”</p>
<p>“No, just talking to myself. By the way, you don’t have to use honorifics with me.”</p>
<p>“Fufu-it’s become a habit, you see.”</p>

<p>With gentle black hair swaying, Suzuka Jinguuji smiled serenely.</p>
<p>Her first impression gives off a traditional young lady who has a Japanese-style charm (Yamato Nadeshiko.), and that’s not wrong at all.</p>
<p>(TN : やまとなでしこ, Yamato Nadeshiko, the personification of an idealized Japanese woman.)</p>

<p>The Jinguuji Group.</p>
<p>A big name I’ve heard many times while I was at my parents’ house.</p>
<p>A major corporation boasting significant financial and political power, with multiple subsidiary companies in the three digits.</p>
<p>Suzuka Jinguuji is the granddaughter of the Jinguuji Group’s chairman.</p>

<p>Furthermore,</p>

<p>“Here you go, Tsubasa-san.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Suzuka.”</p>

<p>As a matter of course, Jinguuji hands over a homemade bento to Homura.</p>
<p>Yes, these two are a couple.</p>
<p>The handsome guy and the young lady.</p>
<p>They really make a perfect match.</p>

<p>“If there were a couple contest at school, you’d definitely win.”</p>
<p>“Well, I wonder about that?”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun, don’t flatter her. Suzuka might get carried away and bring another multi-tiered lunchbox.”</p>
<p>“…! That’s because Tsubasa-san said he gets hungry after club activities…!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, sorry, sorry. But, another multi-tiered lunchbox might be nice.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The portion was enormous, but it tasted incredibly delicious.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, Tsubasa-san really. Fufu-.”</p>

<p>Retracting my previous statement.</p>
<p>These two would likely win not only a school-wide but even a nationwide couple contest.</p>
<p>That’s how close they seemed.</p>

<p>（But that’s not a problem.)</p>
<p>In fact, it’s convenient.</p>
<p>It would be much appreciated if they ignored me and focused on their couple’s talk.</p>
<p>Right, today’s problem is…</p>

<p>“Huhu. So you’ve finally decided to get along with me, Kagisaka?” (Text in img)</p>

<p>A girl with an appearance that stands out from typical Japanese features lightly tapped my shoulder.</p>
<p>She had dazzling silver long hair and slender, long limbs. With a height of 165cm, slightly taller for a girl, she had a beautiful figure that could be featured on a fashion magazine cover right away.</p>
<p>Her facial features were so well-defined that it made one hesitate to approach her.</p>
<p>If Suzuka Jinguji is a graceful Japanese noblewoman, then this girl is a young lady with a mixed foreign heritage.</p>

<p>However, she was no ordinary young lady.</p>
<p>As evidence, she wore earrings, and her uniform had a slightly disheveled look.</p>
<p>A miraculous girl with a fusion of young lady and gal-like charm.</p>

<p>Clearly, she exuded a different aura.</p>
<p>There’s a saying about an unattainable flower, but her presence was like a single white lily blooming on Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Chifuyu Kazami.</p>
<p>She was Tomori’s childhood friend and a girl unanimously recognized as the cutest in the class, if not the entire grade.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Oh! I got it! Azusa and Kagisaka are actually dating, right?”</p>

<p>However.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes into lunch, the situation took an unexpected turn for both me and Tomori.</p>

<p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s why she called Kagisaka here, to tell us about it.”</p>
<p>“But these two always bickering with each other?”</p>
<p>“You know what, Tsubacchi. There’s a genre of couples called ‘fighting couples.(ケンカップル)’ Damianya is the latest one.”</p>
<p>(TN: Found out [Damianya] is a set of names for Anya and her classmate Damien Desmond in SPY x FAMILY.)</p>

<p>‘This Chifuyu know!’ Chifuyu confidently declared with a smug face, reminiscent of a certain esper girl, and then she brought a bagel sandwich to her mouth with her slender fingers.</p>
<p>(TN: Also a SPY x FAMILY reference. Smug Anya Face)</p>

<p>“Huh… Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Even though Azusa and Kagisaka get along so poorly!”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I heard a rumor that the two of them were together in the library the other day. Was that true…?”</p>

<p>Uh-oh, the classroom gallery is starting to get noisy again.</p>

<p>(I guess it’ll be fine.)</p>

<p>Tomori would probably come up with a punchline like, [Huh? No way! To date a slacker like him, a girl would have to be a cabaret girl capable of turning an unsuccessful host into her sugar daddy.]</p>

<p>“Huh, well… Um…”</p>

<p>But our class president was blushing slightly and stuttering.</p>
<p>Wait, what’s with that mysterious movement and reaction? I secretly checked her secret account.</p>

<p>[Fighting couple… I didn’t know something like that existed ~! I see~, Kagisaka and I apparently look like that, hehehe~]</p>

<p>Don’t ‘hehehe~’ me.</p>

<p>“Oh? I said that half-jokingly. Wait, could it actually be true?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Wow, seriously? I can’t believe it! Why didn’t you tell your childhood friend?”</p>
<p>“Well, wait, calm down, Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“Congrats~! Even though it’s weird that it’s Kagisaka, if Azusa chose him, he’s probably not a bad guy, so I’ll support you!”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu…”</p>

<p>To the sudden congratulatory words, she let a joyful murmur in her secret account.</p>

<p>[C-chan, you’re too angelic! I love you! I’ll definitely invite you to the wedding!]</p>

<p>Wait a minute.</p>

<p>(How is she using SNS in this situation?)</p>

<p>Looking at Tomori sitting across from me, she had her left hand in her skirt pocket.</p>
<p>Upon closer observation, I noticed that her pocket was subtly moving… Could it be that she’s typing on her phone with touch-typing skills?</p>
<p>(TN: Touch typing is typing without looking at the keyboard.)</p>

<p>“It’s a misunderstanding, Kazami. We’re not dating.”</p>

<p>While surprised by her unexpected talent, I denied the scandal.</p>

<p>“Really? It seemed so suspicious… Oh, right!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>She extended her partially eaten bagel sandwich toward me and said,</p>

<p>“Come, open your mouth.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka’s lunch is always those plain bread from the cafeteria, right? I thought I’d share my mom’s sandwich with you because it’s really delicious.”</p>
<p>“But it’s half eaten.”</p>
<p>“Huhu, are you worried about an indirect kiss? It’s not a big deal? It’s not like you’re dating Azusa.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu.</p>
<p>She’s definitely trying to forcibly expose whether or not we’re dating.</p>
<p>If I don’t eat this sandwich now, she’ll probably say something like, [I knew it, you can’t get lovey-dovey with other girls in front of your girlfriend, huh?]</p>

<p>We’re not in middle school anymore, so I could just bite into the sandwich without worrying about an indirect kiss…</p>

<p>[T-that’s a lie, right, C-chan?]</p>

<p>A secret account filled with words of resentment as if the whole world betrays her.</p>

<p>[I trusted you… I thought we were best friends… I can’t believe you’re executing my operation….]</p>

<p>Hey, calm down.</p>

<p>[I put effort into my karaage, and it’s definitely delicious… Could it be that C-chan also likes K-kun…?》</p>

<p>Her right hand, holding a fork, was trembling.</p>

<p>[You said before, ‘I have someone I like at another high school.’ … You said, ‘My preference is wild older men.’ after reading a delinquent manga… If it’s a man, is anyone fine…? you…promiscuous, female cat, you devil…]</p>

<p>She’s getting so flustered that she’s even throwing punchlines.</p>
<p>Didn’t you just decide to invite her to the wedding?</p>

<p>“Come on, Chifuyu. Don’t give it to a loner like him, give it to me instead!”</p>

<p>Contrary to her passionate outburst on her secret account, Tomori smiled cheerfully as she begged her.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable shift in trajectory for the highly intelligent honor student, but…</p>

<p>“No~, Azusa already had some yesterday.”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, these two often share lunch together.</p>

<p>“Indeed, as expected of best friends. Your relationship is really good.”</p>

<p>It’s not good at all, Jinguuji.</p>
<p>At this rate, a silver fork of doom will be thrust at C-chan’s throat.</p>

<p>(There’s no choice. Change of plans.)</p>

<p>Usually, I’d leave her alone, but I can’t overlook Chifuyu when she’s in imminent danger.</p>
<p>I’ll have to skillfully guide the conversation and protect their friendship.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Kazami. I’m not in the mood for a sandwich today. It’s like… I want something greasier.”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“For example, fried food.”</p>
<p>“Eh… Is that so, Kagisaka-kun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Specifically, like karaage.”</p>

<p>I forcefully took control of the conversation from Chifuyu and assisted Tomori.</p>
<p>Now, Tomori just needs to take the shot. My job is done――</p>

<p>“Um… umm…”</p>

<p>However.</p>
<p>Tomori was flustered like a Shiba Inu that unexpectedly received a surprise treat.</p>
<p>Her demeanor had an unusual innocence that was unlike her usual self… It made me want to help her more.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that karaage? Can I have one?”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>I picked up a piece of fried chicken from Tomori’s lunchbox and took a bite.</p>

<p>“Wai- you ate it without permission—”</p>
<p>“It’s delicious. Tomori, you’re good at cooking.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I could eat this every day.”</p>

<p>Tomori blinked her eyes like she had received a present from an out-of-season Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Then, she pouted and turned her face away.</p>

<p>“Is your taste buds dull? This is just regular karaage.”</p>

<p>…no, what about your Operation Bento?</p>
<p>I didn’t intend to reenact that whole exchange with her, but I said some lines in an attempt to lighten her mood.</p>
<p>While pondering about it, I checked her secret account.</p>

<p>[Thank you, C-chan! You’re truly an angel! You brought me good luck!]</p>
<p>[I was pampered by K-kun! So pampered! It was worth putting in more effort than usual! Or maybe――]</p>

<p>[Could it be because I was thinking about the person I love while making it? That’s why it became even more delicious!]</p>

<p>Hey…</p>
<p>Isn’t that comment a bit too innocent? It’s good that I was able to protect their friendship, but it’s starting to feel embarrassing…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>Hey…</p>
<p>Isn’t that comment a bit too innocent? It’s good that I was able to protect their friendship, but it’s starting to feel embarrassing.</p>
<p>Saying, ‘I was thinking about the person I love while making it? That’s why it became even’ is…</p>

<p>“Wow… both of you are blushing.”</p>
<p>” ” ! ” “</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s words made us snap out of it.</p>
<p>The silver-haired gal seemed genuinely disappointed.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems like you’re really not dating, huh?”</p>
<p>“Errr… is that so?”</p>
<p>“Your reactions are too innocent for a couple. Just because you ate some fried chicken? Even romantic comedies for elementary schoolers have more daring scenes.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“What a shame. I thought we were going to have two couples.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Tsubacchi. Does that mean I’ll be all alone? And you want Kagisaka to join our group?”</p>
<p>“Of course! Kagisaka-kun is a reliable guy.”</p>
<p>“Good-looking guy that is good at flattery and being kind. No wonder Suzuka fell for you.”</p>
<p>“Fufu-, Tsubasa-san is the kind one.”</p>
<p>“No, no, Suzuka is the one.”</p>
<p>“I was being sarcastic! You should have figured that out, you dumb couple!”</p>
<p>“By the way, Chifuyu-san, do you not have a boyfriend?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>Chifuyu let out a [Hmph] in response to the question.</p>

<p>“The wild men I like don’t go to prestigious schools.”</p>
<p>“So, you prefer the delinquent type.”</p>
<p>“Delinquent, huh? Speaking of which, there’s a big delinquents boys in our district. It’s rumored that their leader is unbelievably strong—”</p>

<p>The lively conversation resumed.</p>
<p>It seems they have lost interest in my relationship with Tomori.</p>
<p>Still, it’s been a while since lunch break was this lively.</p>

<p>I often go to the cafeteria alone and eat, so this is a rare occasion.</p>

<p>(Come to think of it, I should be grateful to Tomori for inviting me.)</p>

<p>The karaage was still juicy and surprisingly delicious, even though it had cooled down.</p>
<p>I don’t want to do this every day, but occasionally having lunch like this――.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>(No, that’s not possible.)</p>

<p>I dismissed the possibility that came to mind.</p>
<p>I thought of something uncharacteristic of me.</p>
<p>Having a meal with someone in a cheerful atmosphere.</p>
<p>It’s like the old days, and I’m feeling nostalgic and happy about it.</p>

<p>“…Kagisaka-kun, anime again? I invited you, so focus on the conversation.”</p>

<p>Her voice sounded slightly sulky.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>Perhaps it was because I was lost in thought, and Tomori noticed that my phone screen was on the desk.</p>

<p>“Anime, what are you watching? Is it ‘Kimi Hana’ by any chance?”</p>

<p>Chifuyu, who was sitting next to me, peered into my phone.</p>

<p>“Hmm, I can’t see.”</p>
<p>“Right. I have a peep-proof film on it to prevent peeping.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s convenient. With that, you can’t see the screen unless you’re looking straight at it. It’s a must-have for watching erotic anime on the train——”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“…Erotic anime?”</p>
<p>“Wrong. It’s for… dog videos.”</p>

<p>Tomori glared at me with narrowed eyes from the opposite seat, so I tried to brush it off.</p>
<p>I can’t admit that I was watching her commentary on her secret account.</p>

<p>“Oh, really? Kagisaka-san loves dogs?”</p>
<p>“I love them. I have one at my parents’ house too. Since I live alone now and can’t see my dog, I sometimes watch videos of dogs on YouTube if I miss her.”</p>

<p>This is true.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>The key to telling a good lie is mixing it with a teaspoon of truth.</p>

<p>(But dogs, huh?)</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Tomori’s personality is somewhat dog-like.</p>
<p>Her usual grumpy attitude is like a cat that doesn’t get close to its owner, but when she confides her true feelings on her secret account, she’s like an affectionate pet dog. It’s somehow cute.</p>

<p>(Is that why I can’t help but peek at her secret account?)</p>

<p>Maybe I’m feeling lonelier than I thought without Sakura.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>Sakura is a pure white Great Pyrenees that my family keeps at home, and she was always very attached to me.</p>
<p>I hardly have any good memories in that mansion, but playing with Sakura, who was like a family member since I was a child, was a different story――</p>

<p>“…Hey, Kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>It seems like it was a mistake to let my mind wander to the radiant memories of my beloved dog.</p>

<p>“If you really want it, shall I give you another piece of karaage?”</p>

<p>Tomori said, displaying a rare bashfulness and a shy smile directed at me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>“Uh, what, Sakura?”</p>

<p>And at that moment, Tomori’s smile froze.</p>

<p>…Huh?</p>
<p>Did I mess up?</p>

<p>“Sakura? Who are you mistaking me for?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>
<p>“Oh, wait. Are you talking about your girlfriend or something?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why would you think that?”</p>
<p>“You were calling her so affectionately! Hee～I see～Kagisaka, so you have a girlfriend!”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>Chifuyu grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>Jinguji leaned forward with keen interest.</p>
<p>‘As expected, Kagisaka-kun, you’re doing well.’ Homura said, seemingly impressed.</p>

<p>The classmates started buzzing with excitement again, exclaiming,[The loner has a girlfriend!] Ah—this was not a good turn of events.</p>

<p>(I can’t exactly say she’s my pet dog…)</p>

<p>Because, you know, if they find out it’s because I mistook [Everyone’s friend] for a dog, I’ll be attacked.</p>
<p>The culprits would probably be members of the Azusa Heartbroken Club, who haven’t given up on dating yet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“Hmm. So you’re saying the loner boy (Botchi-kun) has a girlfriend? I couldn’t care less.”.</p>

<p>Tomori’s reaction was as salty as ever.</p>
<p>Ah, phew.</p>

<p>It seems like she didn’t mind being called by the wrong name――</p>

<p>[…Who is Sakura?]</p>

<p>However.</p>
<p>On the secret account, there are chilling true feelings being expressed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>[Who is Sakura? A friend? Little sister? Big sister? Or maybe a lover? Is Sakura your girlfriend, K-kun? Hey, who is Sakura? Sakura who? Sakura who? Sakura who? Who, who, who, who, who…]</p>
<p>” …….. “</p>

<p>Well, if there’s one good thing, it’s that today’s mission of tutoring Chifuyu will likely be postponed.</p>

<p>(Both Tomori and I have bigger things to deal with, after all.)</p>

<p>As I watched the class president, who was exposing her fangs on SNS like a rabid dog, I started thinking about how to calm her down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span>
