<h1>Chapter 4 - Completely Different</h1>

<p>Suddenly, I was running.</p>
<p>I passed through the station’s ticket gate at full speed and dashed down the stairs leading to the platform.</p>
<p>Although Kimitaka Kagisaka’s athletic ability is not highly regarded despite his good academic performance at the academy, he can run a bit if he puts his mind to it.</p>

<p>(Alright, perfect timing.)</p>

<p>The moment I arrived at the platform, there was an express train that was about to depart.</p>
<p>There were few passengers. I took a seat in the empty seat and took a quick, short breath.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>At that moment, the train doors closed.</p>

<p>” …! “</p>

<p>I involuntarily held my breath.</p>
<p>With a ‘clack!’, two arms were thrust between the closing doors.</p>
<p>I remember seeing a similar scene in an anime movie I watched on Amazon Prime Video before.</p>
<p>(TN: I’m guessing amapura is Amazon Prime.)</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t a purple universal humanoid combat weapon forcing open the doors this time.</p>
<p>(TN: I don’t get this reference.)</p>

<p>“Phew… huh? Why are you here?”</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>The class president, who had just boarded the train, greeted me as if nothing had happened, despite being slightly out of breath.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Let’s rewind time.</p>
<p>Go back about ten minutes.</p>

<p>After class, I headed towards Shin-Himegaoka Station, the nearest station to Aisu Academy.</p>
<p>A new volume of a manga I’m fond of was being released.</p>

<p>(Even though I could have bought it online or as an e-book, there are store-exclusive bonuses.)</p>

<p>I thought of taking a little trip to Shibuya for a change of pace. It would only take 30 minutes if I used the express train.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, but…</p>

<p>[There it is! I found you!]</p>
<p>[Could it be that you’re going to see her?]</p>

<p>I felt a presence behind me and checked a certain person’s social media, and I found out I was being followed.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>In order to shake off the pursuer, I immediately attempted a spontaneous short sprint, but the result was as follows.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be in the same train carriage as you.”</p>

<p>That’s my line.</p>

<p>“Are you stalking me or something?”</p>

<p>Who are you to say that, stalker girl?</p>

<p>“The worst. I knew it, I always thought you would do something like this. You seem to carry a hidden darkness that you can’t tell anyone.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>Stop with your confident poison tongue!</p>
<p>Your secret account is already exposed!</p>
<p>Now you’re just a pitiful clown who dances without realizing that your costume is torn!</p>

<p>But I can’t say that, so I decided to respond with a light remark as usual.</p>

<p>“Tomori, you’re so athletic.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Were you watching me run?”</p>
<p>“No, I saw you forcing open the door. With gorilla-like strength.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>“Are you thinking like a monkey? If something gets caught in the train door, it opens for accident prevention, okay?”</p>
<p>“I know that, Miss Gorilla.” (misu)</p>
<p>“Then don’t tease me, Mister Monkey.” (misutā)</p>

<p>The train started to rattle and move.</p>
<p>With her chestnut-colored hair flowing, Tomori casually sat down in the seat next to me.</p>
<p>And then she took out her smartphone.</p>

<p>[…Geez, you’re really dull. You could at least doubt whether I might have been chasing after you.]</p>

<p>You’re the dull one.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>[Well, I guess you’d never think the person sitting next to you might be live-tweeting on a secret account?]</p>
<p>I guess you’d never think the person sitting next to you might be reading your live-tweets?</p>

<p>[I can’t believe I’m out of breath. I didn’t know K-kun could run so fast and so smoothly. Your form was beautiful and cool~]</p>

<p>To receive praise from a regular helper of the track and field club. It’s an honor.</p>

<p>“Is it okay for a helper like you to be here today?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. I’m going… to a cake shop a bit far from here.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Tomori’s statement is undoubtedly fake.</p>
<p>There is only one reason why she went out of her way to chase after me.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Kagisaka-kun? Could it be…”</p>

<p>Squeeze-</p>
<p>With a nervous expression, she clenched the red-checked skirt of her uniform.</p>

<p>“Are you going on a date with Sakura?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>As expected.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding that arose during lunch break three days ago has not been resolved yet.</p>

<p>I endured until the start of class, aiming for a time-out draw, but I couldn’t withstand Chifuyu’s repeated questioning. So, despite the risks, I decided to throw out a bait.</p>

<p>[ Sakura is very important to me. ]</p>

<p>I wasn’t lying.</p>

<p>(How many times has that fluffy creature healed me during my gloomy childhood at home?)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>Without knowing that, Chifuyu and the others who took the bait exclaimed, [Not bad, Kagisaka!] in a cheerful voice. I could hear shocked screams from the boys in the classroom.</p>
<p>And as for Tomori…</p>

<p>[For someone like Loner Boy (Bocchi-kun) to say something like that, Sakura-san must be a really wonderful person!]</p>

<p>She smiled unnaturally, and I was too scared to look at her secret account for a while.</p>
<p>I successfully evaded the majority’s scrutiny.</p>

<p>However, I felt that one persistent individual was chasing after me like a hunting dog.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“Hey, Tomori. Let me tell you something—”</p>
<p>“Going on a date with your girlfriend after school, huh? As expected of the top student in our year, you’re so relaxed.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. Listen to me—”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk to me. Also, it would be greatly appreciated if you could close your mouth, hold your breath, and stop your heart from beating.”</p>
<p>“…Ah. Is that so?”</p>

<p>As you can see, her retorts were saltier than usual.</p>

<p>(It was like this at school, this is not good.)</p>

<p>When I see her sulking so openly―—I can’t help but want to tease her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“In that case, I’ll just talk to myself. I’m not going to meet Sakura today.”</p>
<p>“Uh… Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I wish I could see her and hug her right now, though.”</p>
<p>” ……! “</p>
<p>” We used to hang out a lot. We took walks in the park together and even slept in the same bed.”</p>
<p>“Haa?!”</p>

<p>‘S-same bed…?!’ Tomori was visibly flustered.</p>

<p>“Wait, it’s not appropriate to say things like that in a place like this…!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“You know… sleeping together…”</p>
<p>“Why do you care? Sakura and I used to kiss every day.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>

<p>With flushed cheeks, Tomori looked down.</p>

<p>“…You’re the worst. So, you’re also a monkey even down there.”</p>
<p>(TN: down there as in lower body.)</p>

<p>She turned her face away and muttered… hmm?</p>

<p>“Err, Tomori?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you… crying, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Don’t say stupid things. Why would I be crying?”</p>

<p>Well, maybe she’s not actually crying.</p>
<p>However, she stubbornly turned her face away from me, her beautiful soprano voice trembled faintly, and, to top it off…</p>

<p>[【Tragic News】 I’m heartbroken…]</p>

<p>Her secret account had a sorrowful declaration of defeat.</p>

<p>[Makeho—…]</p>
<p>[I couldn’t sleep at all last night, and my bad feeling came true.]</p>
<p>[Be happy, K-kun… It’s painful… It’s tough… It’s heartbreaking… If I knew I would feel like this, I wish we never met… I don’t know how I’ll live from tomorrow…]</p>
<p>(TN: [Makeho] is an internet term used when the baseball team you are rooting for loses, and it is often used on SNS. In this case, it’s probably something like; It’s a shame, but that was a good fight’]</p>

<p>“Sorry, Tomori.”</p>

<p>Because it seemed like I was about to cause a personal accident at the next station, I immediately apologized.</p>

<p>” That was a joke. “</p>
<p>” Yes? “</p>
<p>” Sakura is the dog I have at my parents’ house. “</p>
<p>” …A dog? “</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s a dog, you can take it for walks, sleep together, and get licked on the face, right? “</p>
<p>” …Then…”</p>

<p>With her back turned, Tomori’s voice trembled, almost on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“…Is your lower body human? “</p>
<p>” I think that phrasing is questionable, but at least it’s not a monkey.”</p>
<p>” Really? Sakura-san is not your girlfriend, childhood friend, or fiancée?”</p>
<p>“You’re imagining things too much. Sorry for making that joke.”</p>

<p>Sincerely apologizing.</p>
<p>Because I didn’t expect her to start crying like this.</p>
<p>If this can help Tomori’s mood to improve…</p>

<p>“By the way, you called me Sakura in the classroom the other day. Why was that? “</p>

<p>Impressive! As expected of someone who’s ranked second in the class and has a good memory!</p>
<p>I thought about saying something like, [Because Tomori sounds kinda dog-like. Especially when she bites me.] but I’m not that stupid.</p>

<p>——But I anticipated that this question would eventually come up.</p>
<p>I’ve prepared a proper response.</p>

<p>“It’s because you had a similar vibe. Look, take a look at this.”</p>
<p>“!? This, this photo…!”</p>

<p>Tomori’s eyes widen as she looks at the photo I took out from my school bag.</p>
<p>It was a picture of eight-year-old me and Sakura when she was a puppy.</p>
<p>I dug it up from the album I had at home.</p>

<p>“So adorable…”</p>
<p>“See? And, I know it might sound strange for me to say this directly, but… you’re cute too, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“So, that’s why I accidentally called you Sakura. Can you believe me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>

<p>Tomori nodded with a fascinated expression as she continued to look at the photo.</p>

<p>(I thought I wouldn’t get scolded if I said she’s cute like a puppy. Did it work?)</p>

<p>Relieved, I gave my chest a pat and decided to check her secret account just to be sure.</p>

<p>[Kid K-kun is soooo adorableeeee!]</p>

<p>Oh, so that’s what she means.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you this photo.”</p>
<p>“Huh?! Is that okay!?”</p>
<p>“Well, because you like it, right?”</p>
<p>“…!? What are you talking about? I just…”</p>
<p>“I like it too.”</p>
<p>“Huh? S-So, that means we both…”</p>
<p>“I’ve liked puppies since a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Ah, umm, I also love puppies! They’re so tiny, and you can’t help but want to hug them!”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did say it was adorable earlier.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“You must really like it. You were so captivated.”</p>
<p>“Don’t… don’t observe me like that. It’s not okay to peep at classmates on the train. I wasn’t captivated or anything――”</p>
<p>“I see, then you don’t need this photo.”</p>
<p>“Huh? No way…”</p>
<p>“I’m just joking.”</p>
<p>“!? You… you were teasing me… you bully…!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be mad. Look. I’ll give you this photo.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Hmph. Fine, I’ll accept it.”</p>

<p>Tomori received the photo with a slightly dissatisfied expression but gazed at it as if it were a precious treasure.</p>

<p>(――This is not good.)</p>

<p>By using information from her secret account, I can easily manipulate Tomori, who is usually aloof. </p>
<p>Even now, I managed to make her smile after teasing her lightly. That’s why it’s dangerous.</p>

<p>(If I let my guard down, ‘ll get addicted to it…)</p>

<p>If Tomori continues to smile without her usual sarcastic remarks, I could watch her happily all day. However, I can’t afford to let my guard down.</p>
<p>Because there are risks in relying too much on information from her secret account account…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>At that moment, Tomori seemed to remember something.</p>

<p>“――Hey, earlier, did you call me cute?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“You said it, right?”</p>
<p>“…Well, yeah, I did.”</p>

<p>Now it’s my turn to turn my head away.</p>
<p>Because, you know?</p>
<p>If you praise someone so straightforwardly, it can make you feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Oh, well~, even if I’m praised by Loner-kun, I’m not happy at all.”</p>

<p>Damn, you can tell even without checking her secret account.</p>
<p>The class president is in an extremely good mood.</p>

<p>(I did a really good job choosing the photo.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>

<p>I thought it was a bit too obvious to say she’s cute like a puppy, but I didn’t have any other usable photos.</p>
<p>Sakura is a super large breed of dog, a Great Pyrenees.</p>
<p>She’s currently quite big, so even if I say she’s cute like her, she might get angry.</p>

<p>[Tomohō! What’s going on today? So many things are happening, it’s overwhelming! I’m so happy that I don’t know how I’ll live from tomorrow~!]</p>
<p>(TN: [Tomohō] is a term that seems to be derived from the Japanese internet slang “tomodachi hōkoku” (友達報告), which means “friend report” or “reporting to friends.” It is often used in online communities or social media platforms to share updates or express excitement among friends or followers.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>A triumphant declaration on her private account.</p>

<p>(I’m glad you’re happy.)</p>

<p>I unexpectedly found myself thinking that.</p>
<p>Next to me, Azusa Tomori smiles happily.</p>
<p>Her appearance is truly adorable, just like a puppy.</p>

<p>[――But revenge is necessary, right?]</p>

<p>Ha?</p>

<p>[At first, he was teasing me using Sakura-chan as if she were a human.]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>Well, that’s true.</p>

<p>[Punishment start~!]</p>

<p>A lightning-fast execution declaration.</p>
<p>…What does she mean by ‘punishment’?</p>

<p>When I become cautious, Tomori presses her hand against her mouth with her right hand and says,</p>

<p>“Ahh… I’m getting sleepy… Maybe I should take a nap…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>After stifling a yawn, she slowly closes her eyes.</p>
<p>And a few minutes later…</p>

<p>She leans towards me as the train vibrates.</p>

<p>Thump!-</p>
<p>Tomori’s head hits my shoulder.</p>
<p>There’s an adorable silhouette just a few centimeters away. Long eyelashes. Lovely lips like small petals. Fair and flawless, smooth skin.</p>
<p>She looks just like Snow White wearing a school uniform.</p>
<p>I could hear the soothing sound of gentle breathing as if she was peacefully dozing off like a raccoon.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>(TN: “タヌキ寝入り” (tanuki neiri) is a Japanese expression that metaphorically refers to a deep and peaceful sleep similar to that of a raccoon dog (tanuki).)</p>

<p>[I wanted to tease him a bit, but did I go too far?]</p>

<p>As evidence, there’s a post on her secret account.</p>
<p>She activated her secret technique, pocket touch typing.</p>

<p>[How about this? How does it feel to be intimately approached by a girl in a public place?]</p>

<p>It’s a very effective punishment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>“Hey, look at that.”</p>
<p>“That person sleeping is so cute. Her hair is silky, and her skin is beautiful. She has a high facial score.”</p>
<p>“I want to know what moisturizer she uses…”</p>
<p>“Are they a couple? So jealous…”</p>

<p>The middle school girls who boarded at the intermediate station look over here and whisper.</p>
<p>They definitely think we’re a couple.</p>

<p>[Wow, my heart is pounding. I wonder if K-kun is also excited.]</p>

<p>It’s frustrating.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>The weight I feel on my shoulder and the warmth I feel through our uniforms.</p>
<p>Because the distance is unusually close, there’s a faint sweet scent.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it’s perfume or shampoo, but it’s a girly scent.</p>

<p>[I can’t say it out loud, but I can write it on my private account.</p>
<p>――I wish time would stop like this.]</p>

<p>I wanted to expose the fact that everything she said was known, but I couldn’t</p>
<p>When she tweets such happy things, I hesitate to interfere.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>[K-kun… You’re warm…]</p>

<p>Moreover, the current her is full of openings.</p>
<p>She is completely absorbed in the punishment and doesn’t notice, and perhaps due to forcefully opening the door with all her strength, a couple of buttons on her uniform shirt have come undone.</p>
<p>Because she’s tilting her head towards me, from my perspective, I can catch glimpses of her skin and pure white underwear… Ah, this love fool. (Ren’ai baka.)</p>

<p>(She’s way too defenseless.)</p>

<p>If it weren’t for me being next to her, it wouldn’t be surprising if she were pushing me down.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>“Mmm…”</p>

<p>Immediately after, I held my breath.</p>
<p>Along with a deep exhale, Tomori embraced my arm with her slender arms.</p>

<p>It felt like walking down the street with a lover on a holiday.</p>
<p>Her chest pressed against my upper arm, feeling soft and warm.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the slightly rough hug, her bra, and even a hint of her cleavage, were faintly visible.</p>

<p>“Mmm… K-kun…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Why is she using that way of addressing me?</p>
<p>That was supposed to be only on social media――</p>

<p>“Nnnmh…”</p>
<p>Nnnmh?!</p>

<p>Huh? What? What was that just now?</p>
<p>Isn’t that an inappropriate sound for a 16-year-old JK (high school girl) to make in public?</p>

<p>“Could it be… Did she really fall asleep?”</p>

<p>I can’t imagine her making a voice like that, almost like she’s on the verge of snoring.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>(Come to think of it, she tweeted that she couldn’t sleep last night.)</p>

<p>The train’s vibrations feel like a cradle, and the warmth from being close together makes it cozy.</p>
<p>I can understand the feeling of accidentally falling asleep.</p>

<p>“But, sorry, Class President.”</p>

<p>Let’s have her return from the dream world quickly.</p>
<p>Although there’s no one here now, if other academy students get on, it might lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span>

<p>“K-kun…”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>
<p>“I… I want to confess… but…”</p>
<p>“…But?”</p>


<p>Could it be… Is it finally going to be revealed?</p>
<p>The reason why Tomori pours out her feelings on her private account but doesn’t confess to me.</p>
<p>If she unconsciously responds while still in a dreamlike state…!</p>

<p>“Nugyaa!”</p>
<p>“Don’t evolve your sleeping sound.”</p>

<p>I unintentionally muttered, but the class president was soundly asleep.</p>
<p>Moreover, drool is dripping from the corner of her mouth… Ah, really.</p>

<p>“She’s even more similar to Sakura in this aspect.”</p>

<p>Sakura used to lean on me and sleep soundly like this.</p>
<p>Especially after playing a lot and getting tired.</p>

<p>(Tomori must be tired too.)</p>

<p>Being called [Everyone’s friend.] she is constantly busy.</p>

<p>In addition to her duties as the class representative, she listens to consultations from classmates other than her own and assists in various clubs and the student council.</p>
<p>And despite having so many friends, she never seems to rely on anyone.</p>

<p>Basically, she solves any troubles on her own.</p>

<p>(It might not feel strange for students who have been in the academy before high school, but for me, an externally transferred student, it’s quite abnormal.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Tomori maintains second place in our grade.</p>
<p>It must not only be talent.</p>
<p>Her unrelenting efforts have brought about these results… No, achievements.</p>

<p>“Effort, huh?”</p>

<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka is not averse to putting in the effort.</p>

<p>[Listen, Kimitaka. Since you were born into the Kagisaka family, your future is already determined.]</p>

<p>I’ve been hearing that since I was unable to speak.</p>
<p>Most of our family’s career paths are in the medical field.</p>
<p>In other words, doctors.</p>
<p>In other words, they’re elite of the elite.</p>

<p>[Taking care of people’s lives means that failure is not allowed. That’s why you should continue to maintain top grades.]</p>

<p>I was told following those words.</p>
<p>I, who was still innocent, following that advice, worked hard.</p>
<p>I studied without sleep, sacrificed my holidays for extracurricular activities, and tried to become someone worthy of the Kagisaka name.</p>
<p>I pushed myself to the limit and achieved results.</p>
<p>I consistently maintained top grades in school.</p>
<p>I won various competitions in karate, violin, and English conversation.</p>
<p>I wanted to be of help to others, so I even helped a lost child whose name I didn’t know on the street before.</p>

<p>[You, you’re no good.]</p>

<p>However, one day, I was struck with despair.</p>

<p>[Why do you have to put in effort to achieve your goals?]</p>

<p>It was a statement from an undeniable genius.</p>

<p>[People like you and your older brother are different. That’s the nature of the Kagisaka main family. But… Ah, it’s a shame. In the end, you were not a genius, just a bright student. That’s all…]</p>

<p>It was something that not even the greatest doctor could cure.</p>
<p>At the age of 10, my father gave me an unforgiving diagnosis.</p>
<p>No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t overturn that medical record.</p>
<p>I grew tired of my father’s educational policy and ended up leaving home.</p>

<p>(It’s not that I dislike putting in effort.)</p>

<p>As proof of that, I still study tirelessly, sacrificing sleep. It’s to achieve the goal of living on my own strength without relying on the Kagisaka main family. That’s why I can sympathize with Azusa Tomori’s efforts. And like other students, Tomori has also helped me.</p>

<p>[It’s alright! I’m here with you!]</p>

<p>Her soprano voice resurfaces in my mind. I still haven’t repaid the debt from that day.</p>

<p>“――You worked hard, President.”</p>

<p>With such thoughts in my head, I decided not to wake Tomori up.</p>
<p>I took out a handkerchief from my pocket, wiped away the drool from her mouth, and covered her exposed chest area.</p>
<p>Well, this action doesn’t hold much meaning.</p>

<p>Maybe I could hear the reason why she doesn’t confess to me in her sleep talk.</p>
<p>But even if it’s not, it’s fine. Tomori has been taking care of the class representative duties for both of us.</p>
<p>I just wanted her to sleep a little longer and rest from the fatigue of daily life.</p>

<p>(It’s not like I’ve fallen in love with Tomori or anything.)</p>

<p>Certainly, Tomori is hardworking, but sometimes she seems to push herself a bit too hard. It reminds me of my past self.</p>

<p>“K-kun…”</p>

<p>And again, Tomori called my name.</p>

<p>“I love the hardworking K-kun… so much.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>…I’m glad. I’m glad that Tomori didn’t see my current expression. It’s the first time she said it directly instead of through a tweet.</p>
<p>This… I don’t know how to describe it.</p>

<p>“What do Tomori and Sakura have in common?”</p>

<p>They’re completely different, aren’t they? At least when Sakura was sleeping next to me, my heart didn’t race like this.</p>
<p>Now, reflecting on this aftermath, not just Tomori but also myself, I realize that I had accumulated fatigue from my daily studies.</p>
<p>Even though I passed my intended station, the awakening Snow White did not come, so I reluctantly waited for her to wake up.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, we had fallen asleep together.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>“Excuse the intrusion, ladies and gentlemen, but this is the last stop~.”</p>

<p>I was awakened by a young female station attendant who smiled and tapped my shoulder. We quickly got off the train together and…</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wake me up?!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I’m not your mother!”</p>
<p>“This is the mistake of a lifetime. Hey, did you see the smile of the station attendant just now?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I saw. She definitely misunderstood us as a stupid couple or something…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it out loud! It’s the worst… uh, wait, my shirt buttons…”</p>
<p>“Oh, that…”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you did it?! You’re such a jerk… to unbutton them while I was sleeping…”</p>

<p>“Huh… You helped me?”</p>

<p>“Me too. It’s the last stop, so it’s in the same direction as the express train. And why are you turning away… Oh, I see. You’re embarrassed because I helped you――”</p>
<p>“W-Why would I be embarrassed?! You have a really terrible personality!? I don’t owe you anything! I’ll wash and return this handkerchief later!”</p>
