<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Foot Race</h3>

<p>(Is that&#8230; Haruki?)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the girl who sat beside me, Haruki, all afternoon during class</p>
<p>A childhood friend that I used to play with back in the countryside of Tsukinose, running around the fields and mountains together</p>
<p>[Ah, I caught one! I got one too, Hayato!]</p><p>[All right, all right, don&#8217;t hit me!]</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; what a pleasant memories</p>
<p>Earlier, I remembered that Haruki had a bad habit of hitting me in the back when he got excited (TN: I guess MC isn&#8217;t 100% sure whether Nikaido-san is the same as Haruki he knew back then)</p>
<p>It was now wonder that I called her Haruki since she did the same stuff as what he did back then</p>
<p>(Is Nikaido-san&#8230;. Haruki?)</p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s no way that she&#8217;d know my grandpa unless you&#8217;re from the Countryside of Tsukinose.</p><p>I observed Haruki Nikaido with glazed eyes</p>
<p>I knew it, but I couldn&#8217;t believe the fact that this girl sitting next to me, this innocent, and matured looking girl was my monkey-like childhood friend, Haruki</p>
<p>[..!]</p>
<p>[..!]</p>
<p>She noticed my gaze and suddenly hit me with a shredded eraser in the form of a decorative pin. It doesn&#8217;t hurt, but I&#8217;m surprised by her childish behaviour</p>
<p>(How childlish!)</p>
<p>Nikaido Haruki&#8230; she looked at my surprised face with satisfaction, then sniffled and looked forward. The pink tongue that she showed a little back then seemed to be a protest against being a monkey monster</p>

<p>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p>
<p>Finally, today&#8217;s class is over</p>
<p>My classmates quickly return to their own business and most of them are relieved of their boredom. The sky in June, nearing the summer solstice, is endlessly blue, indicating that it&#8217;s still bright outside. It&#8217;s the perfect weather to go out and play</p>
<p>[Hey Kirishima, we&#8217;re going to the Karaoke together, would you like to join us?]</p><p>[Yeah, I&#8217;ll treat you for a drink since it&#8217;s also a welcoming party for you]</p><p>[I&#8217;m curious to see what the new student will sing]</p><p>[Ah, no thanks. You see, I&#8217;m...]</p>
<p>I&#8217;m&nbsp; surrounded by a group of well-behaved and curious people</p>
<p>It was probably a normal thing for them. But for me, who had never interacted with any friends in the countryside, wondering what I should do</p>
<p>(Moreover, I&#8217;ve never been to Karaoke&#8230;)</p>

<p>As I stumbled around in a vague manner, a hand was forcefully placed on my shoulder and I was almost taken away</p>
<p>[Anyway, let&#8217;s go]</p><p>[Wa- wait!]</p>
<p>[No!]</p>
<p>But then, a sharp voice stopped them</p>

<p>[Eh?]</p><p>[Uhm?]</p><p>[Nikaido&#8230; san?]</p>
<p>[ah...]</p>
<p>It was an unexpected situation for them as well, so they decided to pay attention to her, Nikaido Haruki</p>
<p>Haruki herself wasn&#8217;t expecting that, so she was surprised, coughed for a moment, and turned around</p>

<p>[Well. you see. Kirishima-kun has asked me to show him around the school after school. Right, Kirishima-kun?]</p>
<p>[I see, well then, have fun! I&#8217;m so jealous that you can spend your time with Nikaido-san, you lucky bastard!]</p>
<p>[Ah, no, wait. Nikaido-san?!]</p>
<p>As soon as said that line, Haruki pulled my bag and pulled me forcibly against the envious stares of the boys</p>
<p>The power which pulled my bag was unbelievably strong for such a thin arm. She doesn&#8217;t let me say anything. If anything, it&#8217;d be better to say that I was being dragged along</p>
<p>After that, instead of showing me around school, I was taken directly to the doorway and got taken out of the school</p>
<p>[Oi! Where the hell are you taking me?]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s fine, it's fine. Just play along with my scheme]</p>


<p>I ran out of school as Haruki pulled me through the residential area</p>
<p>If someone else were to look at this, you&#8217;d see that a boy was being forcibly taken away by a beautiful girl</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that my face was filled with shame with embarrassment</p>
<p>But Haruki ran ahead as if she didn&#8217;t care about it</p>
<p>At the same time, this is taking me back to when I was still a kid. Being pulled around by Haruki in the countryside</p>
<p>(Hahaha! Nothing has changed, huh?</p>
<p>But instead of walking on the dirt or ravine, we&#8217;re kicking on asphalt right now. That was the only difference</p>
<p>[I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going, but&#8230; you&#8217;re slow]</p>
<p>[HM!]</p>
<p>I tried to provoke her to run faster, just like back then. I started to run faster.</p>
<p>At an instant, Haruki started to run faster as well</p>
<p>Sometimes, I was ahead, but at the other time, she was the one who&#8217;s ahead. Both of us ran through a series of passed and being passed. Running at our full speed with our hands still linked to each other</p>
<p>[Ahaha!]</p>
<p>[Hahaha!]</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what happened</p>
<p>But, I did know that, running with her made me happy</p>
<p>I was reminded of the events and emotions of the past. And now, I finally ensured that&#8230; the girl in front of me right now, was Haruki</p>
<p>Even if they had changed appearance from the past, there were still things that hadn&#8217;t changed, and that made me really happy</p>
<p>[Okay, we&#8217;re here. Here we are!]</p>
<p>[Eh, this is...]</p>
<p>A not common house in a residential area. We didn&#8217;t even have to ask where we were.</p>
<p>It used to be common for us to visit each other&#8217;s houses</p>
<p>[Hm? What&#8217;s wrong, Hayato?]</p>
<p>[Nah, I&#8217;m good]</p>
<p>She had a long hair that reached her back, small hands that were a little cold, and a beautiful face that wasn&#8217;t the same as before.</p>
<p>I felt a bit resentful when she smiled like she was in a good mood</p>
<p>But if I left here, I&#8217;d feel as if I had lost somehow. So I said, "Sorry for intruding" while having those childish thought</p>
