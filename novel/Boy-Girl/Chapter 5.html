<h1>Chapter 5 - Girls' Day Off Talk</h1>


<p>I have a dream.</p>
<p>A dream I recognized it immediately.</p>

<p>[Don’t worry. I’ll take care of her.]</p>

<p>I will never forget it.</p>
<p>It happened about a year and a half ago on a very cold winter day.</p>

<p>[You came to take the exam, right? You’d better get going.]</p>
<p>[But you…]</p>
<p>[It’s okay. Even if I don’t pass, it doesn’t matter.]</p>

<p>To reassure me, [As proof, here. Take it.]</p>
<p>He handed me something small. That something was――</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>I woke up to the sound of the intercom.</p>

<p>(Oh no, I fell asleep while sitting.)</p>

<p>I sat up on the living room sofa, stretched my back, and yawned.</p>
<p>After disabling my ‘sleep mode’, I walked to the entrance and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Oh? Azusa, were you sleeping?”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, did you notice?”</p>
<p>“A very faint bedhead. If it’s not me, it’ll be missed.” (TN: HxH)</p>
<p>“That, it’s a line from an anime?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. Are you okay? If you’re tired, it’s fine if we don’t do it Today.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine! I might be a bit tired, but it’s no big deal!”</p>

<p>After quickly fixing my hair, I invited my childhood friend, Chifuyu Kazami, into the room of my apartment in a 15-story building.</p>

<p>“Azusa, what about your mom?”</p>
<p>“She’s having lunch with her friends.”</p>
<p>“Is it Ginza again? I hope she brings back some souvenirs.” (shopping districts)</p>
<p>“Knowing my mom, it’s probably sweets again. Since she’s a patissier, by the way, why don’t you go wash your hands?”</p>

<p>While giving instructions, I put on a light blue apron.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday.</p>
<p>What will be held Today is Azusa Tomori’s dessert class.</p>
<p>I will teach my childhood friend, who is dressed in plain clothes, how to make a cake.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>“Mmm, this is great!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu, who was enjoying a bite of the finished baked cheesecake, exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It’s amazing. I can’t believe I made this myself!”</p>
<p>“Chifuyu relies too much on estimating measurements by eye. You know, cooking is like math. If you measure the ingredients properly and calculate correctly, you won’t fail.”</p>
<p>“Muu, don’t make it sound so easy. When I try to make things on my own, it just doesn’t turn out well.”</p>
<p>“But if possible, you’d like to impress that person with your baking, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s cheeks flushed slightly. Right, it’s a secret, but Chifuyu has a crush on someone.</p>
<p>The other person is an older boy who goes to a different high school.</p>

<p>“It can’t be helped. That person doesn’t really want to meet me at all.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re trying to invite him out with a homemade cake?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he said he likes sweet things… huhu.”</p>

<p>My childhood friend blushed shyly.</p>
<p>Hmm, I felt a little jealous of that person Chifuyu likes. I never expected Chifuyu to be this smitten. (dereru.)</p>

<p>“Thanks for teaching me how to make it. I want to give you something in return.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then could you upload the pictures I’m about to send you on our class LINE?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s with this puppy?”</p>
<p>“The true identity of Kagisaka-kun’s Girlfriend.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>I explained the whole story to the puzzled Chifuyu.</p>
<p>Of course, I kept yesterday’s incident of falling asleep leaning on Kagisaka-kun a secret.</p>

<p>“I see. If I think about it calmly, there’s no way Kagisaka has a girlfriend.”</p>
<p>I don’t think that’s a very nice thing to say.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped for me. I don’t know why, but for some reason, he’s been avoiding me.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true, but…”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun generally doesn’t want to make connections with others.</p>
<p>That’s why he often acts coldly, and with Chifuyu, he goes beyond that and frequently ignores her.</p>
<p>Huh, there seems to be some reason behind it.</p>

<p>“Anyway, why do you have to upload this photo on the class LINE?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t everyone wonder who Kagisaka-kun’s girlfriend was?”</p>
<p>“Well, I never thought that loner had the initiative for that.”</p>
<p>“Since Kagisaka-kun will probably face a barrage of questions next week, I thought it would be better to reveal it as a scoop beforehand.”</p>
<p>“Did Kagisaka ask you to do that? Is that why you received the photo?”</p>
<p>“Well, something like that.”</p>

<p>Uhh, I made up that story. It was my own decision.</p>
<p>It’s a small token of appreciation for when he helped me with a handkerchief on the day we rode the train together.</p>

<p>“By the way, is this Kagisaka from when he was a child? Why is his face covered with a stamp?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It was like that when I received it.”</p>

<p>一一Once again, a big lie.</p>
<p>I was the one who covered Kagisaka-kun’s face with a stamp when I turned the photo into an image.</p>

<p>(I should respect his privacy, you know.)</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>I’m not reveling in some sense of superiority, like thinking, [I’m the only one who knows what Kagisaka looked like as a child!] (Not a typo.)</p>

<p>“Seriously, Azusa, you’re too kind. If you want to clear up the misunderstanding, you should let Kagisaka himself do it.”</p>
<p>“But Kagisaka-kun isn’t on the class line, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“I asked him several times to join since it’s sad that he’s the only one not in it.”</p>

<p>It was a swing and a miss.</p>
<p>He completely rejected my attempts.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Maybe no one knows Kagisaka-kun’s line.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Yeah, probably. I can’t even imagine that loner exchanging line contacts.”</p>
<p>“Well, I couldn’t get Kagisaka-kun’s line…”</p>
<p>“Azusa, you seem to be quite concerned about Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“――Not really? It’s my duty as the class representative.”</p>
<p>“I see, you want to reform a guy who can’t fit in with the class.”</p>
<p>“That guy. Even though he has a terrible personality… I think he can do well if he tries.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, Tsubacchi also said something similar.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“Homura-kun?”</p>

<p>In response to my question, Chifuyu whispered as if she was about to share a secret.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka’s test scores are good, but his physical education grades are pretty bad. Tsubacchi said he might be doing that on purpose.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“Our school has judo in the elective physical education class for first-year students, right? Tsubacchi ended up with Kagisaka there.”</p>
<p>“Right, Homura-kun is in the judo club.”</p>

<p>Most people are surprised when they hear this because Homura-kun looks more like someone involved in soccer or basketball.</p>
<p>He’s actually skilled enough to rank highly in the Inter-High, but…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>“So, during a physical education class, Tsubacchi had a randori session (brawl) with Kagisaka. And at that time, he apparently thought Kagisaka wasn’t just an ordinary person.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“A judo black belt can understand the opponent’s skills just by grappling with them! It was on Gin Kamu!”</p>
<p>“Gin Kamu?” (TN: Gin= silver, idk but maybe referencing golden kamu.)</p>
<p>“You don’t know? I’ll let you read the whole series next time! But anyway, what’s important is that Kagisaka might be hiding the fact that he can do sports.”</p>

<p>He can actually do it but keeps it hidden, huh?</p>
<p>That reminds me, I have that impression as well.</p>

<p>“Tsubacchi, he’s been really into Kagisaka for a while now.”</p>
<p>“Homura-kun was in the same class as Kagisaka-kun last year too.”</p>
<p>“Same with you, Azusa. You were the class representative with Tsubacchi last year.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. Chifuyu, you probably didn’t know because you were in a different class last year… On the last day before the sports festival, some trouble occurred.”</p>
<p>“Trouble?”</p>
<p>“There was a fight between a boy and a girl.”</p>

<p>It’s a common story.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>During school events, there are often cracks in the unity between boys and girls.</p>
<p>It was my policy to nip any potential trouble in the bud, but at that time, it was my first high school sports festival, and I was too busy to handle everything.</p>
<p>By the time I noticed, in exaggeration, it was on the verge of a civil war.</p>

<p>“Homura-kun and I tried to remain neutral, but we didn’t even have a chance to negotiate a ceasefire. It was really difficult.”</p>
<p>“But Azusa’s class got along well on the actual day, as far as I remember?”</p>
<p>“Well… it was because Kagisaka-kun took action. [I can’t stand being involved in such a pointless fight anymore.] He said that and tore the large flag we had made for the cheering during the sports festival. The flag that we all put our hearts into making.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“Isn’t that too much?! He’s going too far!”</p>
<p>“I was shocked at first too. But, in the end, it became the catalyst for reconciliation.”</p>
<p>“What?… What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“There was criticism from both the boys and girls towards Kagisaka-kun.”</p>
<p>“Huh, isn’t he on the boys’ side… no way.”</p>
<p>“Right. Kagisaka-kun didn’t participate in the conflict in the first place, just like me and Homura-kun.”</p>

<p>An uncooperative outsider.</p>
<p>That’s Kimitaka Kagisaka’s position.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>“And that’s why the boys and girls were able to unite.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s like the protagonist and the rival joining forces because a new enemy appeared?”</p>
<p>“Something like that. Everyone didn’t really want to ruin the sports festival. Probably, they were searching for a way to compromise in their hearts.”</p>

<p>So we quickly made a new flag and gradually apologized to each other in the process, and by the day of the festival, we were completely reconciled.</p>
<p>Class 1-B’s sports festival ended on a positive note.</p>
<p>At the after-party okonomiyaki restaurant, it was party time that felt like yesterday’s conflict was just a lie.</p>

<p>――Yes, except for one person.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>Except for Kagisaka-kun, who didn’t come to the after-party gathering.</p>

<p>“Well, in the end, thanks to Kagisaka, 1-B’s sports festival went well?”</p>
<p>“Right, everything went according to Kagisaka-kun’s plan.”</p>
<p>“Huh? According to his plan…?”</p>
<p>“He deliberately tore the flag to bring everyone together. Kagisaka-kun lacks cooperation, but he’s not the type to suddenly hit someone or do something like that.”</p>
<p>“Well, if that’s the case, it’s amazing… but still, it’s hard to believe all of it was his plan.”</p>

<p>‘That’s not some calculated mathematics, after all.’ Chifuyu munched on the cheesecake.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>(I can understand why Chifuyu thinks so)</p>

<p>The truth is, none of the classmates in 1-B even thought that Kagisaka-kun had planned it. But I was different.</p>
<p>Because on the day of the sports festival, I called Kagisaka-kun out and had a conversation with him.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>[Why did you do that yesterday? Making yourself the villain!]</p>
<p>[Villain? What are you talking about?]</p>
<p>[Don’t make fun of me! Did you think I wouldn’t notice? We could have talked it out together—]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>[We had already passed that stage at that time. You, being smart, should understand.]</p>
<p>[But, still! In the end, criticism was directed at you—]</p>
<p>[That was for the best. Besides, Tomori’s way of thinking is idealistic.]</p>
<p>[Nonsense…]</p>
<p>[Sometimes, it doesn’t end happily ever after for everyone. You, being the leader, have to look at things rationally. If you keep chasing after ideals, you’ll lose your footing.]</p>
<p>[Enough… You’re being so preachy! Why are you talking as if you know everything?]</p>
<p>[I understand. You’ve probably never experienced a failure that made you want to die, right? That’s why you think you can do anything if you try.]</p>

<p>His words at that time felt like he could see into my heart.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>It’s true, I haven’t experienced such a major failure.</p>

<p>(But… is Kagisaka-kun different?)</p>

<p>His words were like he was advising me, warning me, with mature words.</p>
<p>At that moment, he had a regretful expression, as if he had made a big failure that made him want to die.</p>

<p>(That’s why he made strategies to prevent his classmates from making a mistake.)</p>

<p>He calmly read the emotions of the students, prepared just the right challenge for the class to unite, and made sure that criticism was directed only at himself…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>“It’s like being a Protagonist.”</p>

<p>Like a hero in a story, Kimitaka Kagisaka resolved the incident by sacrificing himself.</p>
<p>I think Homura-kun also thought the same way as I did.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why we both respected Kagisaka-kun—</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“A Protagonist, huh? Then he’s just like Azusa.”</p>
<p>“Just like me?”</p>
<p>“You’ve always admired heroes, right? Like superhero teams, the face of a flying puncher made of bread (Anpan), or Santa Claus on Christmas. That’s why you were always helping people.”</p>
<p>“That was…”</p>
<p>“Back in elementary school, when I asked if you were going to join a club or the student council in the future, you said, [Heroes don’t easily join organizations.]”</p>
<p>“Hey, let’s not bring up old stuff.”</p>

<p>…Did I really say something so embarrassing?</p>
<p>As childhood friends, she remembers even the things I’ve forgotten.</p>

<p>“I see. I was wondering why you’re so upset with Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it. I just… I want to become his friend and help him change. Kagisaka-kun lacks motivation, but his abilities are incredibly high. It’s such a waste to let him remain buried like this. If it’s us…”</p>
<p>“As the class president and vice president, become the best partners?”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t go that far.”</p>

<p>Partners, huh? It feels a bit embarrassing.</p>

<p>“But if you want to rehabilitate him, why are you so sarcastic?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t always like that! When we first met, I spoke to him kindly! But then…!”</p>
<p>“Ah, because he always responded with a cold attitude?”</p>
<p>“Yes! It continued like that for so long that before I knew it, even my own words became harsh…!”</p>
<p>“You also wanted to avoid Kagisaka receiving backlash, right?”</p>
<p>“…What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb just because it’s embarrassing. When [Everyone’s friend] becomes close to just one guy, others get jealous. Especially if it’s a problem child who caused an incident during the sports festival, so you deliberately started using foul language, right?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…how do you know that?”</p>
<p>“Idiot. I know better than anyone that you’re too kind. Well, anyway… That’s why the two of you are in this love-hate relationship now.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu stirred the iced tea in her cup with a straw.</p>

<p>“It’s troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I feel sorry. I also think I’ve been using foul language a bit too much lately—”</p>
<p>“No! You can swear at Kagisaka all you want! What annoys me is how Azusa treats him as if he’s the most special person ever! “</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that…”</p>
<p>“It is! Even with me, your childhood friend, you’ve never been so comfortable and free with your words! And you’ve been fixated on Kagisaka despite failing to rehabilitate him for a long time!”</p>
<p>“That’s because…”</p>

<p>I couldn’t say it.</p>
<p>Saying that I had started thinking about him every day while trying to change him was too embarrassing.</p>
<p>As someone who had always been helping others, there was never a student who responded to me as coldly as he did.</p>
<p>That’s why our playful banter felt so refreshing.</p>

<p>(And Chifuyu doesn’t know this, but…)</p>

<p>I had known Kagisaka-kun even before entering high school.</p>
<p>Yes, it happened on the day of the exam for entering high school.</p>
<p>On a very cold winter day—.</p>

<p>“It’s pointless to expect anything from someone like Kagisaka.”</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re going too far. I’ll get mad, Chifuyu.”</p>
<p>“The person I like is definitely cooler.”</p>
<p>“But you never tell me anything about that person!”</p>
<p>“Well… if I consulted you, you’d definitely be against it.”</p>
<p>“What kind of person did you fall for… Bocchi-kun is still better.”</p>
<p>“Don’t compare me to that loner. The person I like is Kazarina—”</p>
<p>“Kazarina?”</p>

<p>When I asked again, Chifuyu awkwardly reacted, saying, “Ah!”</p>
<p>I’ve heard that name before.</p>
<p>They’re a famous delinquent group in the prefecture based in Shin Himegaoka.</p>
<p>They supposedly help troubled teenagers who have nowhere else to turn.</p>
<p>However…</p>

<p>“Are you sure it’s okay? I’ve heard a lot of scary rumors about Kazarina.”</p>
<p>“…like what?”</p>
<p>“There are stories about the leader who formed the team. He’s incredibly strong, and even yakuza avoid him. He’s supposedly defeated a professional fighter who challenged him and he’s extremely clever.”</p>
<p>” … “</p>
<p>“He also has red-dyed hair and is called by a nickname by their members… I mean, your crush isn’t that leader, right?”</p>
<p>“O-of course! Anyway! The person I like is much cooler than Kagisaka! He’s not that unfriendly! “</p>
<p>“No, even Kagisaka-kun lately has been…”</p>
<p>“Has been what?”</p>
<p>“Uhh…”</p>

<p>Dangerous. I almost mentioned that we’ve been getting closer lately.</p>

<p>(Somehow, Kagisaka-kun seems to have become kinder recently.)</p>

<p>He buys me coffee, eats the karaage I make, and gives me photos that he thinks are cute.</p>
<p>It’s something I could never have imagined before.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s as if he’s peeking into my heart with his thoughtful gestures…</p>

<p>“…!?”</p>

<p>At that moment, the worst possible scenario crossed my mind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Hey, what’s wrong? Your expression is frozen like you’re in rigor mortis.”</p>
<p>“Well… um. You know, I often take on various consultations, right? One of them was about my friend… she has a secret account on social media.”</p>
<p>“Mhm, mhm.”</p>
<p>“On that account, she wrote about her feelings for a guy she’s interested in. And then, that guy’s attitude towards her suddenly became kind…”</p>
<p>“Ah, my condolences.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu dramatically clasped her hands together.</p>

<p>“That person’s account is definitely exposed.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>
<p>“Maybe that person was pouring out her embarrassing true feelings on her secret account?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>” … “</p>
<p>“Like tweets that sound like a cringey middle schooler saying things like ‘I love him so much I could die!’ or ‘Why can’t I be more honest?!’ “</p>
<p>” … “</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/T12.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“It’s her own fault. But, I’m glad, Azusa. Usually, saying it’s ‘It’s about my friend’—the phrase actually means it’s about the person themselves rather than a friend, but in your case, I feel it’s not like that… uh, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…why?”</p>
<p>“You look pale. Wait, don’t tell me that what you just said was about you?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>“Ahaha, of course not~!”</p>

<p>I tried my best to deflect while finishing my iced tea.</p>

<p>(…What should I do?)</p>

<p>My heart rate won’t calm down.</p>
<p>If Chifuyu’s right and Kagisaka-kun found my secret account…</p>
<p>He would know all of my true feelings.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t she lock her secret account?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“I see, got it! [Maybe he’ll find this account and realize my feelings!] She was hoping for that!”</p>

<p>Wrongg!!!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>I just decided that he won’t find it anyway, so I didn’t bother setting it to private.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have suspected what Chifuyu assumed… maybe?</p>

<p>“Hey, what do you think that person should do?”</p>

<p>I asked earnestly.</p>
<p>Despite her appearances, Chifuyu can be relied upon.</p>
<p>Sometimes she unexpectedly solves situations in ways no one would expect—</p>

<p>“Say something like 《You’re watching, aren’t you?!》 on her secret account?” (TN: Jojo, きさま! 見ているなッ!)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>“That’s just another line from an anime, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Correct! …anyway, back to the topic. It’s true that it’s embarrassing to have her secret account discovered, but for that person, it’s a good chance.”</p>
<p>“A good chance?”</p>
<p>“That guy went out of his way to find and look at the secret account, right? That means he’s definitely interested in that person.”</p>
<p>“E-Eh!?”</p>
<p>“I think that person really likes her.”</p>
<p>“L-Likes…”</p>

<p>Really?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>Kagisaka-kun, does he… like me?</p>

<p>“Hey, but it’s not certain that the account has been discovered!”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, why not just check directly if it’s been discovered?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible! If she did that, the guy would just brush it off with something like [Huh? Aren’t you being overly self-conscious?] It would be a pointless conclusion!”</p>
<p>“You’re being suspiciously specific with your response… Oh, I have an idea!”</p>

<p>Chifuyu seemed to have another brilliant idea as she stood up with her silver hair flowing.</p>

<p>“Do you remember? The birthday present I gave you last year?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>“Uh…”</p>

<p>Of course I remember.</p>
<p>It was probably meant as a joke, but what my childhood friend gave me was――</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>” …sigh.”</p>

<p>It was nighttime after taking a bath.</p>
<p>Lying down on my bed in my pajamas, I was looking back at my tweets of this morning.</p>

<p>[Today, I’m going to make a cake with C-chan. I hope it turns out well~.]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>Yeah, this one should be okay if it’s seen.</p>

<p>[I wonder if K-kun likes cakes too. I’d like to treat him with a freshly made one.]</p>
<p>…Well, this one might be barely okay if it’s seen…</p>

<p>[If I’m going to treat him, maybe going to K-kun’s place, since he lives alone… Wait. K-kun does live alone, right?]</p>
<p>This… Maybe it’s still okay if it’s seen…</p>

<p>[Going to a boy’s place who lives alone to cook for him… It wouldn’t be strange if he thought I was inviting him to do something, right? But let’s stay calm! Even if I did go, I don’t think that’s what’s going to happen…]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>[What should I do?! If I end up going, should I prepare various things? Like cute underwear… No, wait! Maybe I should bring out the special seductive lingerie I have…]</p>
<p>” …Ugh!”</p>

<p>Unable to endure it any longer, I buried my face in my pillow, suppressing my voice, and shouted the following:</p>
<p>What do you mean, ‘But let’s stay calm!’ ?!</p>
<p>Even someone with a garden in their brain wouldn’t tweet something as idealistic and naive as this!</p>
<p>(TN: meant to indicate someone who is “off in their own world” or spacing out, not thinking straight or not thinking at all.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>” I want to die…”</p>

<p>Maybe because I was happy that I had gotten a little closer to Kagisaka-kun, I ended up letting my thoughts run wild.</p>
<p>If my secret account had been discovered, I had no idea how I should face him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>(…No, I still don’t know.)</p>

<p>There’s also the possibility that all the attention he’s been giving me is just a coincidence. There is only one way to find out.</p>

<p>[Do you remember? The birthday present I gave you last year.]</p>
<p>[Uh, that kinky underwear? The black one with strings and everything, revealing all sorts of things, and see-through like a sl*t?]</p>
<p>[What?! I gave it to you because I thought it was cute! You’re supposed to remember it fondly!]</p>
<p>[…that joke is not funny.]</p>
<p>[I’m not joking――I’m wearing something similar right now! Do you want to see it?!]</p>
<p>[Stop, you don’t have to show it to me. ]</p>
<p>[How annoying… Well, then! If you remember, the conversation will be quick. Let her upload a selfie of her wearing something similar on her secret account.]</p>
<p>[…Huh?]</p>
<p>[Like 《Today, I’m appealing to him with my special seductive lingerie!》. Then let her post something tweets like those from a zero IQ girl who’s looking for a daddy’s love.]</p>
<p>[ I think it’s Chifuyu’s idea that has zero IQ.]</p>
<p>[Huhu, I think it’ll have an effect. If the person sees the secret account, he won’t be able to keep his cool. He’ll definitely be staring at her lower half. Maybe even try to sneak a peek under her skirt.”</p>
<p>[No, surely he wouldn’t go that far…]</p>
<p>[Hahaha, a man is a loyal beast to their lower half.]</p>

<p>‘Anyway, if that confirms whether he discovered my secret account… Oh, it’s already getting late! I want to watch the anime as it airs, so I’m going home now!’</p>
<p>My childhood friend quickly left like a storm.</p>

<p>“Seriously, you’re such an idiot.”</p>

<p>She proposed such an outrageous plan. However, the real idiot is…</p>

<p>“I can’t believe I took these photos.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after Chifuyu left, I excavated last year’s birthday present from my drawer.</p>
<p>And after careful consideration, I hesitantly put it on.</p>
<p>Then, using the large mirror in my room, I took several selfies.</p>

<p>“Well, these certainly have an impact.”</p>

<p>The phone displayed Azusa Tomori standing in front of a mirror.</p>
<p>Holding the phone with my right hand, I covered my face while using my left hand to lift the skirt of my casual clothes.</p>
<p>I was wearing the infamous black underwear.</p>

<p>The contrast between the pale thighs and the jet-black lingerie involuntarily drew attention.</p>
<p>The alluring rose embroidery. Furthermore, the thin lace fabric gave a sense of transparency, revealing the color of the skin… Yes, it was quite provocative.</p>

<p>Then how about this?</p>
<p>Turning my back to the mirror, I struck a pose looking over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Though I still covered my face with the phone, I lifted the back of the skirt with one hand, fully exposing the back of my thighs. Due to the small amount of fabric, my plump buttocks were exposed in a seductive manner.</p>
<p>Along with the photo, I added a sentence with maximum impact:</p>

<p>[Tomorrow, I’ll be wearing different underwear than usual, K-kun. (Wink-wink).]</p>
<p>“…I”</p>

<p>Just at the moment when I could tap to tweet after preparing the text and photo, I finally came to my senses.</p>
<p>I’m just a lascivious b*tch.</p>

<p>“Let’s think of another method.”</p>

<p>I fell into a panic and forgot to let my rationality do its job.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there’s no way I would take such p*rverted photos.</p>

<p>“But…”</p>

<p>What if it works?</p>
<p>What if his attitude changed after seeing these photos?</p>
<p>If he confesses that he’s been looking at my secret account and validates my feelings… and then… comes to me…</p>

<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>This birthday present might evolve into my ultimate seductive lingerie!</p>

<p>“Azusa? Are you still awake?”</p>

<p>Startled by the sound of my name, my body trembled. It was my mother on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>“I’m awake. Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought I heard a scream or something.”</p>

<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>It seemed that my suppressed scream had reached her ears.</p>

<p>“Are you watching a horror movie or something? Don’t stay up too late, go to bed――”</p>
<p>“Okay, oyasuminasai.”</p>

<p>I abruptly shut down the conversation.</p>

<p>(…I’m glad she didn’t come into my room.)</p>

<p>The black underwear I had worn earlier was neatly folded and placed on my desk.</p>
<p>What kind of misunderstanding would arise if that was seen…?</p>
<p>That’s when I realized.</p>

<p>“…Ah.”</p>

<p>With surprising speed, I deleted the latest tweet on my secret account—the infamous text and the mirror selfie with the skirt lifted.</p>
<p>In the moment of surprise when my mother spoke to me, I must have tapped on my phone accidentally. As a result, my underwear selfie was exposed…!</p>

<p>(No! It wasn’t exposed!)</p>

<p>There were no likes, retweets, or replies!</p>
<p>And it was only public for about 30 seconds!</p>
<p>The chance of Kagisaka-kun seeing it was almost zero!</p>

<p>(But… what if he saw it…?)</p>

<p>It was 10:48 PM. Kagisaka-kun might be lying in bed just like this.</p>
<p>If he was using his phone to browse my secret account to pass the time…</p>

<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>Why am I feeling so nervous?</p>
<p>I turned off the lights in my room and pulled the blanket over myself.</p>

<p>“Oyasumi.”</p>

<p>I mumble one more time to distract my racing heartbeat.</p>
<p>But even as I tried to force myself to sleep, my restless heart showed no signs of calming down.</p>
