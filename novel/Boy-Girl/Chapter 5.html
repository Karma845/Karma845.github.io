<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; [Welcome Back] and [See you later]</h3>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ah, pardon for the intrusion]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I&#8217;m the only one here, so don&#8217;t be shy]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[... Really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">When I greeted her with a bit of nervousness, what I got was Haruki&#8217;s words in such a matter-of-fact way</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">She looks like a completely innocent and pretty girl</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">But if she reacts like a bratty girl she used to be, then you&#8217;ll be in trouble</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">While I was thinking about that, Haruki suddenly shouted [Ah!], as if she had noticed something</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hold on right there! Just wait!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oi!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as I thought, she was running up the stairs while holding her skirt in a panic, I heard a slamming, clattering, and some other noisy noise. She must be cleaning up her room</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[... Honestly, what the hell are you doing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Being left in the doorway of a stranger&#8217;s house, I couldn&#8217;t help but sigh</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only that, but because she was running up the stairs at such a high rate of sped, I accidentally caught a glimpse of a boxer-type panties with no-hint of sex appeal on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">A strange feeling of guilt tormented me afterwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Thanks for the wait!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[...Hm]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">After waiting for a while, I was invited to her room by a breathless Haruki. At first glance, the room was tidy. Even though I&#8217;m pretty sure that she just slammed everything to the closet</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The room is dominated by black and brown colored furniture. In the shelves, there were lots of manga, plastic models, and various game consoles. A typical room for a grown-up Haruki</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">If it weren&#8217;t for the mirror and cosmetic products that were placed on the desk, it wouldn&#8217;t be much different from my room</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I&#8217;ll just go see what I can find]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oh, ok. Hey, Haruki]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hm? Also, why don&#8217;t you take it off Hayato? Isn&#8217;t it hot wearing socks?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well yeah, but...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Haruki threw a cushion to me and started to take off her socks. Unlike in the past, her bare feet, which were white and plump, reminded me that she&#8217;s a girl. I was flustered even though I knew that it&#8217;s Haruki</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">And then, she sat down on the cushion vigorously, then sat down on her knees and leaned forward. I couldn&#8217;t help but think of the Haruki I knew back then. Her sex appeal had faded away for some reason, that made me laughed for a bit.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">However, looking at me, Haruki has a condemning look in her eyes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[So, who was the one who said anything about a monkey monster?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ah, no, it&#8217;s...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It seems that Haruki is still angry about my words from this morning</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only that she&#8217;s serious, I could definitely see that she&#8217;s sulking right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">But when those pouting lips and piercing eyes sneered up on me, I felt a strange sweat running down my spine</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well, I&#8217;m sorry. Just consider it as a &#8220;lend&#8221;. I owe you]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hmmm, &#8220;lend&#8221;... Okay, fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Satisfied with my reply, she pulled back her sulky face. Then she muttered the word &#8220;loan&#8221; as if to chew on it, and started grinning</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#8220;Lending&#8221; has a special meaning for both of us</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The loan was to be given on one side, never &#8220;borrowed&#8221;, it is never &#8220;owed&#8221; and it is never offset, it just keeps piling up</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[&#8220;Lending&#8221;, huh&#8230; I miss it. How many do you think you owe me now?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[That&#8217;s my line, you owe me lots of things]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Haha, no doubt]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[... Hehe]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[... Ahaha]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The two of us looked at each other and laughter broke out</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">In this atmosphere, I asked something that had been bothering me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I mean, Haruki, that&#8217;s&#8230; illegal, right?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[My face?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Far from being the little brat that she used to be. She&#8217;s now a neat and pretty, Japanese woman</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Unfortunately, her true nature has come out and she is sitting with her bare feet proudly exposed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well, I&#8217;ve been through a lot. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing this mimicry</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Mimicry, huh&#8230; As expected, you are a monster...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hayato!!!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ahaha, I&#8217;m sorry. I owe you this]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Honestly, what a troublesome person]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I&#8217;ve had many of these little tussles, complaints and fights over the years. Each time, I&#8217;ve lent them out and let it go as time passed. It was also an accumulation of memories</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was both funny and embarrassing to think that we&#8217;d be able to &#8220;lend&#8221; each other again</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt a bit annoyed that my feelings were being noticed, so I looked around the room and found something nostalgic&#12288;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Eh, I didn&#8217;t know that someone still has this game]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[There&#8217;s the software version too, I think I have it]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[How nostalgic]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ok then, how about playing a game after all these years. If you lose, you owe me one]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[That&#8217;s a cheap &#8220;lend&#8221;]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Five wins in a row]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ok!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a console game that we used to play back in the old days, and it was two generations old. It was a karting game with characters resembling mushrooms and turtles. Even I was really enjoying it back then</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">And that feeling&#8217;s still the same today</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Eh, that&#8217;s not fair! Why&#8217;d you draw that item at this time!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Is it because I&#8217;m good at this?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Bullshit]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Haha!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">We hadn&#8217;t seen each other in a long time, but we were playing a game, shoulder to shoulder without talking. Whenever we opened our mouth, the only thing we talked was about the game in front of us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But that&#8217;s enough for now</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt as if the distance between us was being filled</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I noticed that the summer sunlight was beginning to set, letting me know that it was time to end this for today</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well, I better get going]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ah&#8230; I see...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a fun time. So when I was about to go home, I felt a sense of sadness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I understand about this feeling</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The feeling when you thought something would last forever, but it suddenly ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Haruki looks at my back as I put on my shoes, looking like a spoiled child</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I felt her gaze, and her feelings. It was because I felt the same way</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">So, in order to shake off such anxiety, I tried my best to make a cheerful voice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[See you]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[ah...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the usual&#8230; Farewell</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">That&#8217;s where all the feelings were put. There aren&#8217;t just 2 people who understands it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">She came back right beside me, just as we promised. So for Haruki, the greeting for the reunion was&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Yep, I&#8217;ll see you around&#8230; And then, Welcome back!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Welcome back?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[It&#8217;s Welcome back for me]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Haha, what&#8217;s that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Haruki showed a big smile just like a large flower blooming</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">It was the best smile I&#8217;ve seen all day&#12288;</span></p>
