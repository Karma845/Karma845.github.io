<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Flower</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday morning, after breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was in the living room checking out Himeko&#8217;s outfits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think of this? Isn&#8217;t it a little too childish?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of the sofa, Himeko spun around and flipped the hem of her dress. It&#8217;s sleeveless, floral, and sweetly designed for a girl. Himeko groaned, somewhat unconvinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh-huh, it looks nice, I guess?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mou~, Onii, you&#8217;ve got to be serious!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if you say so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, this was the third time Himeko had asked Hayato for his opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one before this was a little more mature, it&#8217;s a dress with a cutaway mile-length skirt that has a design that shows her chest, and the first one was an age-appropriate outfit that she wore to a convenience store the other night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(They all look good on her, and I think any of them would be fine.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko has a lot of good clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she seems to be very particular about what she wears depending on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hayato didn&#8217;t know what his little sister&#8217;s style was, and to be honest, he was troubled when being asked like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This thought showed on Hayato&#8217;s face, causing Himeko&#8217;s cheeks to puff up even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Himeko was about to close in on Hayato with a frustrated look on her face, she caught sight of the clock and started to panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s already time! Mou~, I can&#8217;t help it, this outfit is fine I guess, Haru-chan is older than me, after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re leaving already? It&#8217;s not even nine o&#8217;clock yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu~, it will take some time if I have to stop by Haru-chan&#8217;s house to help her get dressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Ohh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Himeko put on her favorite sandals and ran off. She was probably going to barge into Haruki&#8217;s house with that kind of energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing Himeko off, Hayato let out a big sigh of relief and sat down on the sofa to stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, he saw a clean living room with most of the unpacking done, and Hayato&#8217;s room was similarly clean, with more than half of Himeko&#8217;s room still left to be done, but he wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s nothing else to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s do it. Let&#8217;s see, the burnable trash is on Monday here―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to sort out the garbage and clean the common areas such as the bathrooms and living room hallways. In addition to the laundry that had accumulated, he also washed the sheets of the futon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His handiwork is very skillful and thorough, and he does it quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, the only time he wrinkles his brow is when drying Himeko&#8217;s underwear. It&#8217;s not that he&#8217;s dissatisfied. Even though she was his sister, he was still a little uncomfortable about touching the underwear of the opposite sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the housework was done. The house was small compared to Tsukinose&#8217;s, so it was quicker than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time was just before eleven o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still too early for lunch, and he didn&#8217;t feel like cooking for one person. He looked in the refrigerator to see if there was anything, but it was completely empty. Either way, he needed to go outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s just go then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato muttered to himself, and took out an envelope from the shelf in the living room. He turned on his laptop and checked the address on the envelope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face had a mysterious expression on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato left his apartment and headed for the nearest station. It was an ordinary station building with nothing to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was so surprised and said &#8220;It really took 10 mins to get to the station&#8221; and &#8220;So they have 10 trains per hour here&#8221;, and he&#8217;ll need to go through 2 stations to get to his destination. Then again, he was still so surprised to say &#8220;Oh, one station is so short!&#8221;, and when he got off the train, he headed for a large white building that could be seen from there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in what could be called a suburban area, it had an inordinately large parking lot and lawns and flowerbeds that looked like a place for relaxation, giving the impression of being somewhat inorganic despite the abundance of greenery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After entering the unusually wide lobby and completing the reception, he headed for a room on the sixth floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room marked &#8220;617&#8221; was the hospital room where his mother was staying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Hayato?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mother, who had lost some weight and had become thinner, was peeling a pear with a fruit knife in her six-mat studio room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you want some? I was peeling them for rehabilitation, but I overdid it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah&#8230; Wait, that&#8217;s a lot!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahaha~, there&#8217;s enough for three!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can you eat all this? What in the world are you doing&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. If there&#8217;s any left, I&#8217;ll feed it to your father tonight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dad&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato took the pears which were carefully cut into leaves and rabbits from his mother, who was smiling cheerfully. The crunchy texture and sweet and sour aroma spread in his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mother was squinting at Hayato eating so deliciously, and when noticed her gaze, he felt embarrassed and turned away from her―and asked her worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, that, did that&#8230; go well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The surgery went well, of course. I have some numbness in my fingers, but I&#8217;m going to be moved to a rehabilitation ward soon&#8230; More importantly, where&#8217;s Himeko? Is she crying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s fine. She went out with her friends again today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing that, his mother&#8217;s expression turned into relief, and sighed. Hayato, too, breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of his mother&#8217;s apparent good health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;m going home now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, why don&#8217;t you take your time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After eating three pears, Hayato quickly left the room with his mother looking regrettable at his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to get out of here as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the second time that his mother had collapsed in front of Himeko&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had heard from his father that she was going to be fine, but seeing her in person was a relief, as she seemed to be in better condition than he had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was not fond of hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a place far removed from everyday life, a space where abnormal situations were embodied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white, clean space, which was intended to be clean, was scented with the smell of antiseptic and decorated with colorful flowers that had been cut everywhere, as if they were bleached heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a place with a sense of distortion― that was the hospital for Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when he saw it, he was terribly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person holding it was a small girl with curly hair, resembling a sheep. She was a peculiar girl who planted vegetables in the flower bed of the school building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mi-Mitake-san!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kirishima-san&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a somewhat familiar bouquet of bright white, yellow and purple flowers― a bouquet of vegetable flowers.</span></p>
