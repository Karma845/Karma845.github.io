<h3>Chapter 33 &#8211; Even So... </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell is this!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it amazing?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place that Haruki brought him to was not a karaoke bar at all, but a place far removed from Hayato&#8217;s image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lobby was decorated in the style of a tropical resort, and the room they were shown to was a shoeless flooring room with some cushions lying on the floor. If anything, it was more like a party room of some sort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato&#8217;s stereotype was overturned, and he just rolled his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, to Hayato, karaoke is something that old people enjoy while having a party at a meeting place in Tsukinose. And singing while on the bus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m getting hungry, but I&#8217;m also a little tired.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Oi.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki slipped off her mule sandals and dived straight into the room, lying down and playing with a tablet device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked as if she didn&#8217;t care what other people thought at home, and as expected, her feminine guard was down. Her skirt is shorter than her usual uniform, and her boxer shorts, a piece of cloth that has nothing to do with sex appeal, are in full view covering the base of her flapping legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s appearance is that of a neat and pretty girl. But for some reason, all Hayato could hear was a sigh mixed with a headache.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hayato silently fixed the hem of her skirt, which had been rolled up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oops, this is an unsightly thing&#8230; No, it&#8217;s just a reaction to being so careful not to be seen until just now. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I can see everything, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a perk, right? Oh, did I just make you nervous?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You were thrilled when you realized you were looking at Himeko the same way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ngugugugu~, What does that mean!? I wonder!? I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this, but I&#8217;m still pretty popular, you know!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah! Hey!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s rivalry was switched on, and she untied the left shoulder strap of her summer dress with her usual mischievous smile. Then, making a cinnamon shape to emphasize her breasts, she pressed her body against Hayato&#8217;s in a pampering manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How are they, Hayato?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki, you&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn&#8217;t help but gulp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an act of utmost sincerity, based on a full understanding of her own attractiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a destructive force that forcibly removed the best friend filter that had been applied to Hayato just a moment ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Haruki&#8217;s eyes were filled with a hint of amusement. Because he could see it, Hayato&#8217;s face also showed his regret. And when Haruki acknowledged this, she got even more excited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the intervention of a third party that broke this sterile cycle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Excuse me, this is the ripe banana maple syrup pudding honey toast that you&#8217;ve ordered.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pyaah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A waitress intervened. It was a young female staff member who looked like a college student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hayato and Haruki noticed this, they distanced themselves from each other as if they had been repelled, and for some reason ended up sitting on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them had red faces and sweat on their backs. they could only hope that they could leave soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is your serving plate&#8230; or is there more you&#8217;d like to order?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-We&#8217;re fine!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yeah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waitress did her job with a smile, not caring what Hayato and Haruki were thinking. However, before leaving, she nailed them with a warning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;*Clears throat*. This is not the proper place for that sort of act, so please refrain from doing that, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nha!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Miyaa!?&#8221;</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the door slammed shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waitress’ eyes were focused on Haruki&#8217;s untied left shoulder strap earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was just an extension of their banter, from the perspective of others, there was no excuse for what they were probably doing something&#8230;erotic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;N-No, I didn&#8217;t intend to do that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, calm down, Haruki. But I can&#8217;t deny that it was a little bit naughty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Miyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Calm down!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to stand the embarrassment, Haruki charged into the huge honey toast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whole loaf of bread, not only covered with butter and maple syrup, but also with some ripe bananas and pouting, decorated with a colorful ice cream and whipped cream, is a mass of sweetness. It&#8217;s a conglomeration of fat and sugar that you should never think about the calories nor the aftermath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She threw it into her mouth without a second thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, sh*t, me too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nghhh~!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was not to be outdone by Haruki, and without using a plate, he challenged the main dish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two red-faced childhood friends are gobbling up the sweetness in a desperate attempt to hide their embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a sight jumps into each other&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Kuku.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Pfft.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell are we doing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re so stupid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahaha.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found it irresistibly funny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before they knew it, they were looking at each other and laughing, just like when they were kids.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An hour later, with their stomachs full, Hayato and Haruki ended up leaving the restaurant without singing once, partly because of the indescribable atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of Hayato&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;Ngghh~!&#8221;, as Haruki stretched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which seemed to reset the mood and gave him a sense of déjà vu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Well, in the past, even if we had a fight, we used to play it off the next day like it didn’t happen.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering this, he reaffirmed their unchanged relationship, which made him chuckle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you know, it was the first time we went to a karaoke bar and we didn&#8217;t even sing anything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right. We just had lunch after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, well, maybe next time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;..Ah. Yeah, that&#8217;s right, next time!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s eyes fluttered and she looked happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she stared at Hayato&#8217;s face and tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was Haruki, Hayato felt uncomfortable when she was staring at him so intently. He furrowed his brows and stared back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato is a boy, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? What are you even saying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just now, I was wondering if what we are or we’re&#8230; on that kind now! But! Hayato is Hayato, and I&#8217;m me, and so&#8230; what the hell are we?&#8221; [TLN: Err, I tried my best, doing this sentence kekw.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That is difficult.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s hard.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both tilted their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki had a good point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a strange relationship when they thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The height, the shape of the body, the size of the palm of the hand&#8230; There are many things that have changed since the past, and there are many things that confuse them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he can&#8217;t help but be confused, as if the relationship is still the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many things that have changed since the past, and there are many things that confuse him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Hayato and Haruki were still the same old Hayato and Haruki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Still, we are what we are, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are what we are, huh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They laughed at each other with troubled faces, saying such things. Unbeknownst to him, Hayato was holding Haruki&#8217;s hand, just as he had done in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a completely unconscious action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an ingrained habit, you could say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki reacted with a twitch from the linked hands, and Hayato finally realized that he had held hands with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a man and woman of his or her age hold hands for no reason or reason at all, it takes on a special meaning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ngh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato noticed this and tried to pull his hand away, but Haruki squeezed his hand in return, and although Hayato was confused, he could tell from the palm of his hand that he wanted to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that okay? When he looked at Haruki&#8217;s expression, she nodded her head, her ears and neck turning red. Then, without looking at each other, he turned away and whispered in a resentful voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really, I&#8217;ve always been pushed around by Hayato&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? If anything, I&#8217;ve been pushed around by you more than myself. Physically speaking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, mou, I don&#8217;t know anymore! Look, there&#8217;s a bunch of people over there. Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, wait!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki then pulled him towards the crowd of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Clearly I&#8217;m the one that’s being pushed around, aren&#8217;t I?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato thought about this as he was being pulled along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems to him that this is an indication of a relationship that has never changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt like he was bringing back something he had once let go of, a void that had been severed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crowd of people gathered. A destination that attracted the attention of many people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s face faded to a pitiful pallor when she saw the person at the end of the crowd, and she froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing stays the same― this was something that Hayato and the others knew very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clouds were drifting away in the city sky, just like in the countryside.</span></p>
