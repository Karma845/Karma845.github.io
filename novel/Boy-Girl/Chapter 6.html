<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Continuation of the Past Summer</h3>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">The place I lived in was a room in a ten-story apartment building not far from Haruki&#8217;s house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the countryside, I used to live in a one-story wooden house. Now, I lived in a concrete reinforced apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">My front door in the countryside was always carelessly left open, but now, the entrance of my apartment is equipped with an automatic lock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">There are so many differences between the countryside and the city, and I often get lost. I still can&#8217;t seem to get the hang of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I&#8217;m home]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Welcome back, Onii] (TN: Himeko refers her brother as &#8220;Onii&#8221;)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Himeko, I can see something from here]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hm? You want to see it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I&#8217;m telling you because I don&#8217;t want to see it]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Then don&#8217;t look at it]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Geez]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the living room of my house on the sixth floor, my sister greeted me with an unmotivated voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">She has shy eyes, brightly dyed hair with loose perm, and a school uniform that has been worn down to the point of being innapropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">My sister, Himeko, is a girl who cares about fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I personally think that she&#8217;s pretty cute, even though she&#8217;s my sister. But right now, she&#8217;s lying on the sofa with her skirt rolled up. She has a very disappointing appearance. Even I frowned at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(Haa&#8230;They&#8217;re really similar huh&#8230; Haruki and Himeko )</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;I couldn&#8217;t help but to compare the image of my childhood friend with the image of my sister in front of me, and let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;m the only one who can see her like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;m the only one who can see her like this&#8221;, I thought for the second time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Himeko, where&#8217;s dad?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hospital, he&#8217;s going to visit mom]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I see, what about dinner?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Please make it, Onii. I&#8217;m kind of busy right now]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Himeko was impatiently playing with her phone. After a few moments, I could hear her groaning, &#8220;Hmm, I remembered that even before I came here, I had been gasping for air, not wanting to be considered as a country bumpkin.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">&#12288;&#12288;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">I&#8217;m sure that she&#8217;s been asked lots of questions, just like me. I guess she must have been doing lots of research for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Why don&#8217;t you just say that you&#8217;re a country bumpkin from the start?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Onii, shut up!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Himeko had a bit of a tendency to be vain. There were a few times when she made mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I turned my gaze from my sister to the fridge, trying to search for ingredients to cook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">(Let&#8217;s see&#8230; Leftover pork from the special sale, white onion, green pepper, chinese cabbage, and shiitake mushroom...)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">This afternoon, I only ate cobbled bread for lunch, so I&#8217;m currently in the mood to eat something heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I decided to cook for today&#8217;s dinner. So I might as well tell the steps to you.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">First, cut the pork into small pieces, marinate it in a sauce made of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Then, add potato starch and sesame oil.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the meantime, chop up the vegetables. The amount of the vegetables is fairly loose, as I&#8217;m also using most of the ingredients in the fridge. After that, I made a mixture of oyster sauce, bean sauce, soy sauce, and sake.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Lastly, just stir-fry the ingredients, add the seasoning, and voila, you&#8217;ll get a chinjao lose! (TN: You can search for it on google)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Serve it with some instant miso soup and freshly cooked rice and dinner is done!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Himeko, dinner&#8217;s ready]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Okay&#8230; wait, wow.]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[What is it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[You&#8217;re still cooking the same old stuff for dinner aren&#8217;t you, Onii?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Well, it&#8217;s a normal dish, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Yes, it is]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the countryside, where entertainment was rare, people would gather at someone&#8217;s place for a party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I used to be invited to make snacks, what&#8217;s better is that I got some pocket money from that. Inevitably, my set of menu was biased towards these foods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Let&#8217;s dig in!]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Go on]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Mnn~, as expected, It&#8217;s better to eat this with rice. Oh yeah, do you know, Onii?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Hm?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[When I first went to school, I noticed this but&#8230; There&#8217;s no coin rice mill near here&#8230;]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Say what?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[But I found one, uhhh&#8230; 10 minutes walk from here, there&#8217;s one <a href="https://news.cdn.nimg.jp/articles/images/4614514/cc4a59b274d999a817b5ea949f3afd1f5e8469d3526a0e2f2faa3c900241321daa40aa0e3fa1178d75e2ca3824ccba2878f099ed16da976014ccec183d33c382">coin rice mill</a>]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Is that&#8230; Is that really the nearest one?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Both of us are horrified by the difference between the countryside of Tsukinose and the city we moved to.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Not only me, but my younger sister seems to be having a hard time with the gap between our locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Anyway, what happened?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[What?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Something good happened to you right, Onii?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[How did you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[You&#8217;ve been smirking this whole time]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">When my sister pointed it out, I noticed that for the first time that my cheeks were relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">If anything, I was so happy that I got to see my childhood friend Haruki again that it showed on my face.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">So I naturally smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I met Haruki&#8230; at school]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oh my god, you met Haru-chan?] (TN: I guess our MC is the only one who misunderstood Haruki&#8217;s gender)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[What&#8217;s more is that, I&#8217;m sitting next to her]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Wow, How does Haru-chan look now?]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[You see...]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I think about my childhood friend, whom I met again today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">In the past, she always wore shorts, a shirt, and a hat. Her clothes were always muddy and she had scratches all over her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But now, she has lustrous hair that reaches all the way down to her back and white skin without a single blemish, let alone a scratch. At first glance, she looks like a neat and pretty Yamato Nadeshiko (TN: I explained this before, right?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">But her mischievous smile made me think that she was the same as she was back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">[She hasn&#8217;t changed at all. She even&nbsp; remembered the &#8220;loan&#8221; system we had]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Oh I see, I wish I could meet her]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[I think she&#8217;s getting stronger than before. Maybe she&#8217;s evolving from a monkey to a gorilla]</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">[Ahaha, what&#8217;s that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">After that, we both talk about our childhood friend, Haruki. All kinds of memories come flooding back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">I also remembered my loans to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">That time when the size of the ice cream I divided in half was uneven.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">When we competed to catch the most cicadas.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">When we competed in a game, just like today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">By using this &#8220;loan&#8221; system, we&#8217;ve managed to accumulate lots of memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">That day, when the end of summer came.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The day when I thought our promise would forever collapse.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">We entwined our pinkies to make the promise that we were still alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">We used to be the same height, but now, we&#8217;re different...</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The hands that used to be the same size are now different...</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">Although the speed of our steps was the same, there was a difference between our stride length...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial;">Such differences have appeared between us while we&#8217;ve been apart.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">But I&#8217;m sure, these differences won&#8217;t bother my relationship with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial;">The relationship that I thought was over, was about to begin again as the summer draws closer.</span></p>
