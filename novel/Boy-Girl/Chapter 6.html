<h1>Chapter 6 - Events on a Snowy Day</h1>


<p>“Good morning, Azusa-san… Oh, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p>“Your face looks a bit tired.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, that’s not true, Suzuka.”</p>

<p>A blatant lie.</p>
<p>I was completely exhausted as soon as I arrived at school.</p>

<p>“Ugh, it’s so annoying! Why is the wind so strong?”</p>

<p>Chifuyu, who entered the classroom later, was desperately fixing her disheveled silver hair.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a windy day in the morning.</p>
<p>Normally, I wouldn’t be so concerned about my hairstyle, but today was different.</p>

<p>(No one is watching me, right?)</p>

<p>I sat down at my desk, suppressing such worries. It was an unusual worry from my usual self.</p>
<p>I was wearing black tights underneath the school uniform skirt. And underneath that… wearing that black underwear.</p>

<p>(…No, let me excuse myself.)</p>

<p>I actually thought about not wearing it anymore.</p>
<p>But then, one possibility crossed my mind.</p>

<p>What if Kagisaka-kun saw yesterday’s tweet?</p>
<p>What if, as a result, Kagisaka-kun’s attitude changed dramatically?</p>

<p>Confessing that he saw my secret account, affirming my feelings, and then… coming after me and asking for——</p>
<p>He might be disappointed if I wear ordinary underwear!</p>

<p>(…seriously, I must be overthinking.)</p>

<p>I became thoroughly disgusted with myself for having such foolish thoughts before going to school.</p>
<p>I wore tights because I was worried about what was underneath my skirt.</p>

<p>(But, even if he affirmed my feelings…I-I don’t think he would immediately come after me, right?)</p>

<p>I don’t know about what Chifuyu said about ‘a man is a loyal beast to their lower half.’</p>

<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<p>Someone spoke to me unexpectedly, and I felt tension run through my spine.</p>
<p>It was Kagisaka-kun, who put his bag down on the seat next to me.</p>

<p>“Good morning. Did your personality switch? The socially awkward you greeting me?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t any particular reason, but…”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“You looked like you had something on your mind.”</p>

<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>You are the cause of my troubles!</p>
<p>Could it be that he’s teasing me since he saw that tweet?</p>

<p>“The cause of my troubles is you. Can’t you do some work for once?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I have a backlog of anime I want to watch.”</p>
<p>“You have acquired a congenital addiction to anime. Wouldn’t it be cured if you underwent a brain extraction surgery?”</p>
<p>“You should be the one receiving treatment. Toxic substances seem to be leaking from your mouth.”</p>

<p>While exchanging our usual banter, I casually observed him.</p>
<p>Chifuyu said he was staring at my lower half, but that’s impossible. Kagisaka-kun isn’t that kind of person.</p>

<p>” …! “</p>

<p>However, contrary to my expectations, Kagisaka-kun looked at me.</p>
<p>His gaze was clearly directed toward my skirt…</p>
<p>N-No way?! Is Kagisaka-kun a creature loyal to the lower half of his body?!</p>

<p>“Is that okay? You have a run.”</p>
<p>“!?”</p>

<p>I checked, and indeed, there was a run around the area of my right calf.</p>
<p>(TN: Run, “伝線” refers to the presence of a small tear or unraveling of the clothing.</p>

<p>(Why today of all days?!)</p>

<p>Come to think of it, according to the morning horoscope, my zodiac sign was at its lowest.</p>
<p>From the sudden strong wind to everything else, nothing was going my way… No, maybe it’s an opportunity.</p>

<p>“Whoa, I didn’t notice.”</p>
<p>“You’re unusually calm… Wait, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing to have a run, so I’m taking them off.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go to the girls’ restroom or something?”</p>
<p>“Don’t overreact too much. This is why you’re an introvert. I’m wearing a skirt, so it’s not a problem.”</p>

<p>That’s a lie.</p>
<p>Even if I’m wearing a skirt, I usually take them off in a place where boys can’t see.</p>
<p>But for now, it’s different.</p>

<p>“Mmm…”</p>

<p>Feeling my heart pounding, I take off my indoor shoes. Then, while sitting on the chair, I put both hands inside my skirt and slowly lowered my tights.</p>
<p>From an angle, it’s not visible to everyone in the classroom.</p>
<p>Yes, except for Kagisaka-kun sitting next to me.</p>

<p>“Fuuh…”</p>

<p>I hold my breath as soon as the jet-black tights come off, revealing my white tight. Not good.</p>
<p>It feels even more lewd than I imagined!</p>

<p>“Nnmmh…”</p>

<p>Blushing and trying to hide my embarrassment, I let out a sigh as I lower the tights to my ankles.</p>
<p>Then, with my skirt swaying…I lift my right leg slightly and pull one foot out of the tights.</p>
<p>Using the same method, I do the same with my left leg.</p>

<p>(This is… no good…)</p>

<p>This is way too embarrassing!</p>
<p>Every time I lift my leg, the skirt sways, providing a rather provocative view from Kagisaka-kun’s seat!</p>

<p>“The recent ‘Kimi Hana’ episode was a God episode, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>However, the troublesome person next to me never once glanced in my direction.</p>

<p>(T-this guy…!)</p>

<p>I’m enduring all this embarrassment for him!</p>
<p>He’s just talking about anime as usual!</p>
<p>In that case, it’s time for an additional combo attack!</p>

<p>“Alright, I took them off. Now, just the socks…”</p>

<p>Deliberately commentating on the procedure, I retrieve my knee-high socks.</p>
<p>To be prepared in case of sudden rain, I have spare socks in my locker. After returning to my seat with them in hand, I put on one sock at a time.</p>
<p>Just like when I took them off, I lifted one leg slightly, letting my skirt sway…</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T14.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>However…</p>

<p>(…Err, why don’t you sneak a glance?)</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun, in the seat next to me, is glued to his smartphone.</p>
<p>Suppressing my sense of embarrassment, I try crossing and uncrossing my legs a few times after putting on the knee-high socks, trying to create some alluring scenes, but there’s no effect.</p>

<p>Could it be… am I not that appealing?</p>
<p>Am I not being perceived as a potential romantic interest?</p>

<p>Somehow, I feel like crying for a reason other than embarrassment…</p>

<p>(…you’re an idiot. I went this far…even if you didn’t see yesterday’s tweet, it would be nice if you took a glance at least once.)</p>

<p>You act like you know what I’m thinking… No, that can’t be true, right?</p>
<p>I haven’t used my secret account since deleting that tweet.</p>

<p>Unless there’s a special reason, there’s no way he can read my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Tomori-san.”</p>

<p>At that moment, our homeroom teacher, Kuonji-sensei, entered the classroom and spoke to me.</p>

<p>“Yes, is something wrong? “</p>

<p>Without letting any of the various emotions swirling inside me show on my face, I respond with a smile.</p>

<p>Well, whatever.</p>
<p>Today has just begun.</p>
<p>I have plenty of time to test Kagisaka-kun.</p>

<p>“Well, actually, I have a favor to ask.”</p>

<p>However…</p>
<p>Upon hearing Kuonji-sensei’s request, I realized again that the morning horoscope was right on the mark.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>5th period in the afternoon.</p>
<p>During this time, it’s LHR. (Long Homeroom)</p>
<p>Usually, Kuonji-sensei would be standing at the podium, but…</p>

<p>“Oh? Where’s Kuonji-chan?”</p>
<p>“She had a sudden business trip. So, as the class representative, I’ll be her substitute.”</p>

<p>I respond to a question from a male classmate while standing at the podium.</p>
<p>Instantly, the attention of the entire classroom focuses on me.</p>

<p>(I didn’t expect to be standing at the podium.)</p>

<p>If I had known, I definitely wouldn’t have worn this underwear.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only problem——</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s start LHR.”</p>

<p>Did you all look at the handout I distributed earlier?</p>
<p>I urge everyone with a poker face while cursing my own misfortune from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>“Today’s topic is the precautions of using SNS.”</p>

<p>——Ah.</p>

<p>I want to shout this to my past self from last night with all my might.</p>

<p>“One thing you need to be careful about when using SNS (social networking services) is the digital tattoo. Information such as text or photos once posted on the internet becomes difficult to erase, just like a real tattoo.”</p>

<p>I read aloud the contents of the handout given to me by Kuonji-sensei. The words pierce my chest like a dagger.</p>

<p>“Because once that information is saved by someone else… it can be spread without the person’s knowledge…”</p>

<p>What if!</p>
<p>What if someone already spread the mirror selfie from yesterday…?!</p>

<p>“Therefore, let’s refrain from posting photos or videos impulsively.”</p>

<p>“Haha, isn’t that obvious?”</p>
<p>“But一, There are girls who post dirty selfies on their secret accounts just to appeal to guys.”</p>
<p>“Are there such girls among us?”</p>
<p>“Well, even elementary school students receive SNS courses nowadays.”</p>
<p>“There is no way there’s a girl with zero internet literacy who’s that stupid and only thinks about men like that.”</p>
<p>“Azusa, you think so too, right!?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, that’s right.”</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but there’s someone like that here!</p>
<p>Moreover, not only does she just upload images, but she also wears lascivious lingerie!</p>

<p>“Tomo-chan, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“You’re sweating a lot. Do you have a fever?”</p>
<p>“Haha, well, did you catch a cold from sleeping in light clothes yesterday?”</p>

<p>The one wearing light clothes now is my lower half!</p>
<p>Not only am I reading such a print out loud, but just the thought of standing in front of everyone with this kind of underwear…</p>

<p>I even thought about writing an SOS on my secret account using the smartphone I slipped into my pocket.</p>
<p>If Kagisaka-kun happened to see the secret account, maybe he would help me.</p>

<p>(…No, that’s impossible…)</p>

<p>I have a feeling Kagisaka-kun doesn’t even look at my secret account.</p>
<p>As evidence, his behavior today has been the same as always.</p>
<p>I tried to get his attention a few times, but he didn’t give me any glances.</p>

<p>Chifuyu said yesterday it’s obvious he’s interested in me. But there’s no way such a dream-like thing happened.</p>

<p>(…Although I felt like the distance between us had slightly closer.)</p>

<p>But still, I think Kagisaka-kun has no interest in someone like me——</p>

<p>“How long are you going to stay silent, Class President?”</p>

<p>However…</p>
<p>As I was lost in thought, Kagisaka-kun, the always nonchalant vice president, approached me and came to the podium.</p>
<p>He snatched my printout.</p>

<p>“If you’re feeling unwell, go to the infirmary. I’ll read this for you.”</p>

<p>“Whoa? That’s rare. Kagisaka is doing class representative work.”</p>
<p>“Can you even handle being Azusa’s substitute?”</p>
<p>“We might as well cancel it altogether, huh?”</p>

<p>Complaints started to pour in from the whole classroom.</p>
<p>It’s understandable, considering Kagisaka-kun’s troublesome behavior, but what can I do?</p>
<p>If it’s gotten to this point, even I will need time to calm things down…</p>

<p>“It’s not like I want to do it either.”</p>

<p>However, he remained unfazed and said,</p>

<p>“Tomori asked me before class.”</p>

<p>Yes?!</p>

<p>“She said, [If I’m feeling unwell, I might ask for a substitute midway. Since you never do any work, you can handle that, right?].”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Astonishment and confusion swirled in my head.</p>
<p>Of course, I never made such a request like that.</p>

<p>“If it’s canceled, it’s convenient for me too.”</p>
<p>“Wait…!”</p>
<p>“You slacker! If Tomori asked you, you should have said it earlier!”</p>
<p>“There’s no way we’re canceling! It was originally Azusa’s assigned task, so you must do it properly!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Tomo-chan! Take a rest in the infirmary. We’ll keep an eye on Kagisaka to make sure he does his job properly!”</p>
<p>“What’s this? Are you all full of motivation?”</p>

<p>The vice president chuckled with a wry smile and said, ‘I thought it was going to be canceled.’.</p>
<p>The classroom’s complaints and dissatisfaction from earlier seemed like a lie as everyone focused on the podium.</p>

<p>(…Impressive.)</p>
<p>(TN: I changed it. It’s actually; (…鮮やか) (Azayaka), a Japanese word that means “vivid” or “bright.” It is often used to describe something that is intensely colorful, distinct, vibrant, or eye-catching.)</p>

<p>Everyone intends to keep an eye on Kagisaka-kun.</p>
<p>In other words, no one realizes that they’re all being manipulated by him.</p>
<p>Using a single lie, he effortlessly took control of the classroom instantly.</p>

<p>An amazing bluff.</p>
<p>His confident attitude is so convincing that it’s hard to believe he’s lying.</p>

<p>(And with the statement, ‘It’s convenient if it’s canceled,’ he influenced the people around him.)</p>

<p>His behavior is so mature that it’s hard to believe he’s just an ordinary high school student.</p>
<p>I can say with certainty that Kagisaka-kun is not just another troublemaker buried in the crowd.</p>

<p>——But.</p>

<p>Why did he help me?</p>
<p>I haven’t even tweeted an SOS on my secret account yet…</p>

<p>(No…)</p>

<p>SOS doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>I’m the only one who knows.</p>
<p>Even without someone asking for help, Kagisaka-kun is the kind of person who will lend a hand.</p>
<p>That’s why I fell in love with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>I remember it vividly.</p>
<p>It happened about a year and a half ago on a very cold winter day.</p>
<p>It was the day of an entrance exam to enter the high school.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s starting to snow.”</p>

<p>I muttered to myself while watching the snowflakes falling from the sky.</p>
<p>On the sidewalk, there were students wearing the same gray uniforms as me, bundled up in coats.</p>

<p>(I hope no one slips and gets hurt in the snow.)</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but worry about such troubles.</p>
<p>Resolving troubles at the academy had become a sort of life work for me.</p>

<p>It all started when a friend of mine was being bullied in a nearby park during our elementary school days.</p>
<p>The girl came from a musical family and was very talented at playing the piano, but she was often teased due to her timid nature.</p>
<p>So, I helped her.</p>

<p>The bullies came in a group, and I was on the verge of losing the fight, but a peer around the same age who happened to pass by came to our aid, and we somehow emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was quite a rough episode, but I couldn’t forget the words the girl I helped spoke: [You’re like a hero, an ally of justice.]</p>
<p>From then on, I started to resolve other people’s problems and troubles.</p>

<p>(Oddly enough, I had some ability.)</p>

<p>I had always been capable of handling various things to some extent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe that someone with such abilities should naturally act for the sake of others.</p>

<p>(That’s why I ended up idolizing heroes, perhaps.)</p>

<p>And fueled by that admiration, I continued to grow, eventually earning the nickname of [Everyone’s friend]. But——</p>
<p>On that day, I encountered a trouble that truly surprised me.</p>

<p>“Whoa, that kid is dangerous!”</p>

<p>A girl walking in front of me shouted.</p>

<p>The sound of a loud car horn.</p>
<p>On the way to school, at an intersection.</p>
<p>Despite the traffic light being green, several cars were stuck there.</p>
<p>And blocking their path was…</p>

<p>(What are you doing there?!)</p>

<p>A big Golden Retriever was barking fiercely.</p>
<p>It’s likely a pet dog since she’s wearing a collar.</p>
<p>It might have gotten separated from its owner while out for a walk.</p>
<p>The Retriever was being honked at repeatedly.</p>

<p>(Is everyone ignoring that…?!)</p>

<p>I look around, but there’s no one that tries to help.</p>
<p>The girl who shouted earlier pretends not to see anything and continues walking.</p>

<p>That’s only natural.</p>
<p>Today is the day of the entrance exam, where our future education is at stake.</p>
<p>Unless there’s a reason like sudden illness or an accident that the teachers find acceptable, being late for the exam is not allowed, and that would mean not being able to pursue further education.</p>
<p>That’s why everyone is ignoring the Retriever.</p>

<p>“———”</p>

<p>In that moment of realization, I abandoned the red umbrella I was holding and ran into the middle of the intersection.</p>
<p>I didn’t seek help from anyone.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if they would cooperate even if I asked for help, and I had confidence in myself.</p>

<p>(I’ve resolved numerous troubles on my own before.)</p>

<p>So, even today…!</p>

<p>“Don’t worry! I’m here!”</p>

<p>While soothing the Retriever, barking fiercely, I grabbed the fallen leash on the ground.</p>
<p>I forcefully pulled the Retriever towards the sidewalk.</p>

<p>(Ah, thank goodness.)</p>

<p>For now, I can be relieved and—</p>

<p>“Grrrr!”</p>

<p>—Oops, I let my guard down.</p>
<p>Startled by the sudden tugging of the leash, the Retriever exposed its sharp teeth and barked.</p>
<p>Then, it leaped towards me—</p>

<p>“Kyaa?!”</p>

<p>In an instant—I was pushed aside by someone.</p>
<p>Struggling to maintain my balance, I manage to regain my posture and not fall.</p>
<p>Then quickly checking the situation, I turned my attention to the person who pushed me.</p>

<p>“Calm down. It’s okay now.”</p>

<p>A calm and gentle voice. That someone… a boy with a red scarf around his neck, held the Retriever’s collar firmly.</p>

<p>(An unfamiliar uniform, an external student?)</p>

<p>Today’s entrance exam included students from outside the school, so he might have been there by chance.</p>

<p>“Did you get separated from your owner? I see, you must have been scared.”</p>

<p>He calmly spoke to the Retriever, even as blood flowed from his right wrist, presumably from being bitten while protecting me.</p>
<p>His composure seemed to have a calming effect as the fierce growls gradually subsided.</p>

<p>“Yosh. Good boy.”</p>

<p>He let out a sigh and held onto the leash that was hanging on the ground.</p>

<p>(…Amazing. You easily subdued a large dog.)</p>

<p>As if the earlier rampage had been a lie, the Retriever sat obediently on the sidewalk…</p>
<p>No, this is not the time to be impressed!</p>

<p>“Are you ok——”</p>

<p>I hurriedly approached.</p>
<p>The snow falling on the road was dyed red by the blood flowing from his arm.</p>
<p>The wound might be deep…!</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>However, he didn’t seem to be concerned about his own injury at all.</p>

<p>“Sorry for pushing you so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“Uh, well… I’m fine! But more importantly—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll take care of him. You came to take the exam, right? You’d better get going.”</p>
<p>“But what about you…?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Even if I don’t pass, it doesn’t matter.” He said, “As proof, here. Take it.”</p>

<p>He handed me a small something. A talisman with the words [Academic Succes] written on it.</p>
<p>It had a cute design that looked like a girl made it rather than something bought at a shrine.</p>

<p>“I’ll search for the owner alone.”</p>
<p>“No! You go ahead, and I’ll search for them!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re trying to make sure I’m not late for the exam, aren’t you? “</p>
<p>[Even if I don’t pass, it doesn’t matter.]</p>

<p>That’s probably a lie. No one who isn’t aiming to pass would be here.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>That’s probably a lie. No one who isn’t aiming to pass would be here.</p>
<p>Moreover, he even gave me the talisman to reassure my panicking self.</p>

<p>“You and I just met! You shouldn’t go this far for someone you don’t know—”</p>
<p>“You.”</p>

<p>In a calm voice that contrasts with my agitation, he admonishes me.</p>

<p>“You, who tried to help a stranger’s dog, are saying that?”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if I know them or not. It’s only natural to help someone in need.”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>

<p>It was an irrefutable argument that left me speechless.</p>
<p>His words were exactly what I had been doing all along.</p>
<p>Helping students I knew and those I didn’t know.</p>
<p>But that’s precisely why I couldn’t just leave him alone…!</p>

<p>“Or is it that you’re so stupid that you can’t even understand something like that?”</p>
<p>“Uhh…”</p>

<p>Caught off guard by his sudden words, I could only fall into silence.</p>
<p>He seemed to purposely try to provoke my anger.</p>

<p>“I see, so from the beginning, you didn’t have the confidence to pass the exam, and you were just looking for an excuse to fail.”</p>
<p>“…Hey!”</p>
<p>“Instead, you can say, ‘I failed because I was helping a stray dog, so it’s not my fault,’ how pathetic, resorting to such a lowly means to protect your pride. There’s no way I can entrust this dog to someone so hopeless—”</p>
<p>“Fine, if you’re going to say that, then I’ll go!”</p>

<p>Surprising even myself, I shouted.</p>

<p>“But don’t you dare do anything cruel to that dog!”</p>
<p>“Of course not. This dog is a good boy. It’s not as rabid as you.”</p>
<p>“…How despicable. You must have very few friends.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. You seem to have plenty. Maybe it’s because you’re good-natured to the point of being naive and foolish.”</p>
<p>“A loner has no right to say that to someone like me! I’m relieved! I’m so relieved to hear that you won’t even take the exam!</p>

<p>Saying that I won’t have to see him again, I start walking away.</p>
<p>His attitude infuriated me beyond measure.</p>
<p>And… I felt a deep sense of regret.</p>

<p>After he risked himself to help me and the Retriever, he suddenly said something awful.</p>
<p>That’s why I continued walking on the school route without ever looking back.</p>
<p>But… why did his attitude change so suddenly?</p>
<p>That’s what I was thinking as I reached the school gate of Aisu Academy—it was a moment of realization.</p>
<p>I finally noticed his wits and kindness.</p>

<p>I wanted to hurry back, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p>If I did that, his concern would be in vain.</p>

<p>(—Please. Don’t be late and make it on time. Please pass the exam. I said something like that earlier, but…)</p>

<p>He is the one who should pass the exam more than me!</p>
<p>I tightly held onto the talisman he gave me and desperately wished for it.</p>

<p>As the snow falling from the sky dimmed the cityscape.</p>
<p>My regret grew stronger.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>Several months later…</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I encountered him again.</p>

<p>“Representative of the new students, please give a speech.”</p>

<p>It was in the auditorium of Aisu Academy, which served as the venue for the entrance ceremony.</p>
<p>We, who passed the exam to enter the high school section, sat in the audience seats.</p>
<p>At the urging of the teachers, the boy whose name I couldn’t hear that day stepped onto the stage.</p>

<p>“Uh, isn’t the representative Tomori?”</p>
<p>“I think that guy came out on top in the exam? “</p>

<p>The venue suddenly buzzed with excitement.</p>

<p>Right, one of the teachers secretly told me that I ranked second.</p>
<p>It was the first time in my life that I couldn’t achieve first place.</p>

<p>“A student I’ve never seen before. Could he be an external student?”</p>
<p>“Unbelievable, it’s been years since someone other than a homegrown student became the representative.”</p>
<p>“But, it’s that ‘Kagisaka’, you know?”</p>

<p>Kagisaka?</p>

<p>“Uh, there are rumors that he arrived late for the entrance exam?”</p>
<p>“Right. Even though the start time had long passed, he was allowed to take the exam as an exception.”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka, the majority of their family members are elites in the medical field, right?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that his parents are prominent figures? Like a super-elite doctor favored by politicians and bureaucrats?”</p>
<p>“My parents are doctors too, but they said they couldn’t compare to the Kagisaka family. They seem to have connections in the political and financial circles.”</p>
<p>“So that’s why the teachers let it slide?”</p>
<p>“In that case, the exam results don’t matter? He became the representative because of his family background!”</p>
<p>“That’s… Azusa, you poor thing…”</p>

<p>No, there’s no way that’s true!</p>
<p>I wanted to loudly refute the hushed conversations among my friends.</p>
<p>There’s no way he would be accepted as the representative just because of his family background.</p>
<p>Only I know the truth.</p>

<p>(He didn’t arrive late on purpose.)</p>

<p>He saved the lost Retriever that no one else tried to help.</p>
<p>He even went out of his way to help me, who didn’t ask for help.</p>
<p>He played the role of an outcast just to ensure I made it to the exam venue.</p>
<p>It was like something out of a Hero’s story.</p>

<p>“———”</p>

<p>However, he showed no signs of any other intentions and simply gave me a lackluster greeting.</p>
<p>That was our reunion.</p>

<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>
<p>Looking back, there was no doubt that I was already drawn to Kagisaka-kun at that time—</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Kagisaka-kun!”</p>

<p>Time returns to the present.</p>
<p>It’s the evening, and I’m calling out to Kagisaka-kun just as he steps out of the school building.</p>
<p>The strong wind that was present in the morning has calmed down.</p>

<p>“Are you feeling better now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, um… Thank you for helping me today.”</p>

<p>In the end, I followed his suggestion and left the LHR midway.</p>
<p>It was my first time faking illness, but I rested in the infirmary bed for a while and returned to the classroom in time for the end of the day.</p>
<p>Now, I’m stopping him on his way home to express my gratitude.</p>

<p>“You liar. You lied to the whole class.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have as much popularity as Tomori, that’s why. Well, I don’t want to take charge of the class again.”</p>
<p>“What a waste. You have the ability, so you should use it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have any abilities, really.”</p>

<p>For some reason, Kagisaka-kun’s voice sounds slightly self-deprecating.</p>

<p>“More importantly, it’s rare for Tomori to come and express her thanks.”</p>
<p>“You, on the other hand, are as aloof as ever. Won’t you just accept my thanks sincerely?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t specifically do it because I expect something in return, though.”</p>
<p>“That might true. But…”</p>

<p>As we walk along the cherry blossom trees adorned with fresh green leaves, I look up at the face of the boy taller than me and honestly convey my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Even without saying ‘help me,’ Kagisaka-kun, you helped me again.”</p>
<p>“Again?”</p>
<p>“On the day of the entrance exam, you helped me too, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“That happened, huh?”</p>
<p>“You have such a bad personality. Even though you remember it clearly.”</p>
<p>“I got caught. Well, it’s no surprise that it left an impression. Even though I insulted you when we parted ways, you came and thanked me politely after the entrance ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Because I know you deliberately chose to play the role of the villain.”</p>

<p>Back then, I couldn’t see through his intentions, but Kagisaka-kun is perceptive.</p>
<p>Realizing that he couldn’t convince me through a normal conversation, he intentionally acted in a way that would provoke my anger.</p>
<p>It was all for the sake of getting me to the exam venue.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize it at the time and left him behind in anger.</p>
<p>And…</p>

<p>“…I’m sorry. I heard rumors that weren’t favorable towards you after the entrance ceremony, so I made sure to deny them to everyone…but…”</p>

<p>[Azusa-chan, you’re as kind as ever.]</p>
<p>[You don’t have to lie to protect Kagisaka!]</p>
<p>[That guy helped the dog and Tomori? I can’t believe that.]</p>

<p>Conversations like that, where no one took me seriously.</p>
<p>I can understand why, considering how Kagisaka-kun appears at the academy.</p>
<p>He lacks cooperativeness, doesn’t show kindness to others, and is a loner. But——</p>

<p>“Please stop, it’s getting on my nerves.”</p>
<p>“Ehh…”</p>
<p>“Don’t suddenly put on that apologetic face. The bad reputation around me is my own fault. It’s not Tomori’s fault.”</p>
<p>“Kagisaka-kun…”</p>

<p>Yes, the real him is different.</p>

<p>[I know it, even though no one else does.]</p>
<p>[K-kun is a really kind and reliable person.]</p>

<p>I mutter it like bragging as if boasting about it on my smartphone tucked in my pocket.</p>

<p>(That’s why I wanted to reform him. I wanted to liven up the class together as class representatives. I wanted us to become friends.)</p>

<p>Looking back now, at that moment of reunion——Maybe I undoubtedly fell in love with Kagisaka-kun.</p>

<p>(And a new goal was born.)</p>

<p>The boy who helped me, who always helped someone else.</p>
<p>Yes, from now on, it’s not just about helping someone…</p>

<p>[I want to become someone who can make him like me. That’s why no matter how much I like K-kun, I won’t confess my feelings first. Because…]</p>
<p>[Because I want to hear the words ‘I love you’ directly from K-kun’s mouth!]</p>

<p>Just as we reached the school gate, Kagisaka-kun stopped.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, he was looking at the smartphone in his right hand.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? Are you watching another dog video or something?”</p>
<p>“Uh… well, something like that.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it must be a really cute video for you to even walk while using your smartphone.”</p>
<p>“Ah… yeah, I also think I’ve been looking at it too much lately.”</p>

<p>Despite my sarcastic comment, he surprisingly showed sincere reflection.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s because of the sunset, but his face looks a bit red.</p>
<p>Could it be that he’s actually looking at my secret account…? I was about to doubt that, but…</p>

<p>(There’s no way that’s true.)</p>

<p>Looking back, I was being overly self-conscious.</p>
<p>He gave me the canned coffee, ate my karaage, and gave me a photo.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he had been looking at my private account.</p>

<p>It was all because Kagisaka-kun is a kind person.</p>

<p>(I should thank Chifuyu. Friends are the best thing ever.)</p>

<p>Despite everything that has happened, I’ve realized what’s truly important, and it feels like I can get closer to Kagisaka-kun.</p>
<p>Ah, as expected of Chifuyu Kazami.</p>
<p>With the character ‘風’ (wind) in her surname, she brings a favorable wind to our relationship—!</p>
<p>(TN: “Kazami” (風見) is a Japanese surname composed of the kanji characters for “wind” (風) and “see” or “observe” (見). It can be interpreted as “one who observes the wind” or “one who sees the wind.” This surname may evoke the image of someone who is perceptive, aware, or attuned to their surroundings.)</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>I may have been too carried away with my excitement.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew!</p>
<p>It must have been a remnant of the strong morning wind.</p>

<p>Completely defenseless, I took the full force of the wind.</p>
<p>My hair became disheveled.</p>
<p>My arms couldn’t defend against it in time.</p>
<p>My skirt fluttered wildly.</p>

<p>“Ah—”</p>

<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I completely forgot about the fact that Kagisaka-kun helped me with LHR.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what’s under this skirt…</p>

<p>“!”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun’s face beside me froze, or rather, turned red.</p>
<p>And it’s definitely not because of the setting sun this time.</p>

<p>“…Did you see?”</p>

<p>Feeling my own face burning as well, I asked with a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Hey, did you see?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Please, tell me the truth. I won’t get mad.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>

<p>He took a deep breath and prepared himself with a certain expression on his face.</p>

<p>“Hey, isn’t that underwear a bit too revealing? It’s black with side strings, it’s clearly giving off a sl*tty vibe–“</p>
<p>“So you did see it, huh?!”</p>
<p>“Wait. You said you won’t get mad—”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not angry! I just want to yell… But anyway, please listen, Kagisaka-kun! There’s a reason why I’m wearing something like this!”</p>
<p>“…what kind of reason?”</p>
<p>“Well… It’s all because of Chifuyu! She’s the one who makes the wind blow…!”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I mean, the wind earlier was quite strong, but…”</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s not what I wanted to say—”</p>
<p>“But blaming Kazami for it is unreasonable, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Hey, wait! That’s not what I meant to say!”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to hear these words!</p>
<p>While complaining in my mind, I decided to change my initial plans and walk with Kagisaka-kun along the commuting route to somehow explain myself.</p>

<p>(TN: She’s the one who makes the wind blow…!, The pun lies in the word “風” (kaze), which means both “wind” and is a part of the character’s name, Kazami (風見).)</p>
