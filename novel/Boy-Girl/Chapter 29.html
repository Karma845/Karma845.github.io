<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; Lost Face</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, in a large hospital room nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, Hayato was being bowed to by Minamo Mitake&#8217;s grandfather.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry &#8217;bout that, kid. Okay, are we done here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mitake. Minamo-chan will be very angry with you for being so careless.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Grandpa Mitake, I don&#8217;t care if Minamo-chan stops talking to you, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuh~&#8230; My bad, I&#8217;m sorry! So forgive me, boy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his appearance was one of disapproval, and he looked as if he was forced to do so by the other members of the large room. One could not help but feel that he was still not convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, calm down, Mitake. You boy, are you the sensei who&#8217;s been teaching Minamo-chan about vegetables lately?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Se-Sensei!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Minamo-chan has been smiling happily lately, thanks to you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even that old man thanks that teacher behind his back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Fuu~n.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahaha~&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s eyes are very sharp and hostile towards Hayato. He seems like a difficult person to get to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, judging by the fact that the people around him are making fun of him, it&#8217;s likely that his granddaughter is not involved on that front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more thing, Minamo Mitake seems to be well loved by the people around her. That&#8217;s probably why she frequents this place so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, kid, you seem to be a new student&#8230; So why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you talking to our Minamo?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know Minamo is cute. You could say she is an angel without wings. I can understand why you would want to talk to her. Are you hitting on her? Are you playing with her? If so, you&#8217;re―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an unusual amount of energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And without pausing for a beat, he thrust his cane in front of Hayato&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s very difficult to laugh it off as a joke, and he couldn&#8217;t resist saying what he was thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-She resembled one of my neighbors from where I used to live! I took care of her a lot, and the way she panicked was just like her, so I couldn&#8217;t leave her alone!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Minamo you say? What kind of girl is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s an eight-year-old girl with the same curly hair.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that&#8217;s why you approached her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake&#8217;s grandfather looked a little uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the other people in the room muttered positive things like, &#8220;I can understand,&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s a bit sly,&#8221; and &#8220;I feel like giving him candy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato made a deceptive &#8220;Ahaha&#8230;&#8221; sound, but even though she was eight years old, she was a sheep and had long since reached old age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Minamo Mitake, who had gone to change the water in the vase, came back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grandpa, where are the flowers&#8230; Grandpa!? What are you doing to Kirishima-san!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mi-Minamo, this is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Grandpa! Don&#8217;t do anything strange to Kirishima-san! Come on, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mi-Minamo!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that old man Mitake&#8217;s jealousy is getting the better of him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See you later, Minamo!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Minamo Mitake came back, she was surprised to see Hayato with his grandfather holding a cane to him and immediately took his hand and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way she was pulling his hand was so strong that it was hard to imagine that it was her normal hand, and her ears and neck were red with shame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could not help but feel embarrassed to see her relatives being so mischievous, so she dragged Hayato along with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when they reached the lobby on the first floor, he began to feel embarrassed at the sight of the girl pulling him along.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mitake-san, umm, my hand&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh&#8230;Ah! I-I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, no.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first time he has held the hand of the opposite sex, apart from his sister and childhood friend Haruki. When he became aware of this, Hayato&#8217;s face rapidly heated up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, to cover it up, he mentioned it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H-He&#8217;s surely an energetic old man who loves his grandchildren.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ah. That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something he said without thinking. And in fact, Hayato had seen him in good health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this was a hospital, and her grandfather was an admitted patient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time she realized what had happened, it was too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake&#8217;s face, which until then had been tinged with shame, was now shadowed, and she looked as if she was about to start crying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was only for a moment― and then she showed her usual squishy smile, which disturbed Hayato&#8217;s heart. He cursed himself for his carelessness and lack of delicacy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not Kirishima-san&#8217;s fault&#8230; It&#8217;s my grandpa&#8217;s fault&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, yeah, that&#8217;s&#8230; right. Haha.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them bowed their heads and apologized to each other. Then, they smiled bitterly at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gloomy look on her face earlier was probably only for a moment, and her face, as they looked at each other, showed some core strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why the dark face he saw earlier was bothering him even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Mitake-san&#8217;s face&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought they looked alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day. The day when he was a child and his mother collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The face of Himeko, who couldn&#8217;t do anything on her own and had to stand by his side for a long time in a daze, lost for words, like a lost child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Hayato felt that he couldn&#8217;t leave her alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With that, Kirishima-san, until next time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ah, you see, Mitake-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ermm, uhh&#8230; the flower bed! Can I go to the flowerbed again&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fue?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must have been an unexpected remark for Minamo Mitake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after, her big eyes blinked, and then her eyes widened in understanding, and she broke down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Un, looking forward to it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minamo Mitake&#8217;s smile was met with an ambiguous smile from Hayato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was aware that there was something selfish about this offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said good-bye and hurried out of the hospital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he stepped outside, a strong wind blew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It washed away the smell of disinfectant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early summer sky, the clouds were rising.</span></p>
