<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Living in Solitude</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was alone, heading for Haruki&#8217;s house where Himeko had taken her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahoo~&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The asphalt was covered in flames, and the occasional breeze was lukewarm without a hint of coolness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato couldn&#8217;t decide if it was the uncomfortable weather that was making him feel a little queasy, or if it was just childish jealousy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He simply moved his feet sluggishly. It was as if he was hesitating to give an answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, he eventually arrived at Haruki&#8217;s house as he was walking on scorching lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an ordinary house in a residential area that Hayato had visited several times. It should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was about to press the intercom as usual, but then he remembered Haruki, who had returned to this house the other day as if she had been sucked into the darkness, and somehow he hesitated and stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Ah, shit, it&#8217;s hot!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato scratched his head with his hand, as if to cover up something, and pushed the intercom with his momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doorbell rang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of silence, the door was thrown open with a loud bang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Look, Hayato, Hayato&#8217;s here! See!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, get Haru-chan!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki came flying out of the front door like a bullet, and Hayato did as he was told by Himeko and caught her in a hug.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuh, you betrayed me Hayato!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on here, but calm down Haruki.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was bewildered in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had no idea what was going on with Haruki and Himeko, and the fact that he could fit into their arms so much better than in the past, the softness and heat of the arms he grabbed, and the feel of Haruki&#8217;s breasts and thighs against his chest as she flailed, left him confused in many ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can go ahead and take Haruki in, Onii.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Oh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was something strangely powerful about Himeko that made him think it was best not to go against her. It was a contrast to Haruki, who was sagging. She was taken back without saying a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she seemed to have a lot of time on her hands when she said something like &#8220;stick around&#8221;. He guessed that this was just another form of messing around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hayato was about to step into the room he had recently become accustomed to visiting, he couldn&#8217;t help but take a step back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fashion magazines lined up on the desk and the cosmetic products that he had seen in Himeko&#8217;s room were spread out in a fashionable space that was just like a girl&#8217;s room that boys should stay away from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder Haruki ran away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if to make an example of him, plain and tasteless tacky shirts, shorts and pants were laid out on the bed, and Hayato couldn&#8217;t help but look at Haruki&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, what do you think of those private clothes that are far from fashionable and sexy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a tough look, even for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki couldn&#8217;t believe it and looked at Hayato as if she was looking at a traitor, but Hayato looked back at her as if she was looking at a sad creature. This time it was Haruki&#8217;s turn to flinch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hayato and Himeko both started inspecting Haruki&#8217;s ruined sense of personal clothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan, these are all black, cheap, plain and often worn out, and this shirt doesn&#8217;t fit, does it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These are clothes that can get dirty and remind me of the ones I used to wear as a kid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that thing you were wearing the other day was the result of a miracle&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, it was a miracle&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s tears welled up in her eyes and she sagged as her two childhood siblings gave her a hard time. &#8220;Eh, that&#8217;s not good enough either?&#8221; Haruki even made a faint whimpering sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Himeko&#8217;s eyes looking at Haruki were extremely kind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Haru-chan, even if you don&#8217;t want to walk around with me in your old, ruined sense of style, Haru-chan is Haru-chan. I won&#8217;t abandon you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m that bad!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hi-Himeko!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Himeko gave a refreshing smile, giggled and softly whispered to Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Haruki was startled by the suddenness of the question, but then her face became more and more serious, and she smiled that mischievous smile she always showed Hayato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What in the world&#8230; is she brainwashing her?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato watched the two girls with a dumbfounded look on his face, as if they were playing a different kind of trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way she glanced at Hayato from time to time was something he had seen several times in his childhood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―So&#8230; What do you think? Doesn&#8217;t that sound interesting?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, sensei!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Very well, then―&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko nodded her head in satisfaction as Haruki raised her right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Himeko at the center of the class, a fashion lecture unfolded, using magazines as textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, Hayato didn&#8217;t understand what was going on, and Haruki didn&#8217;t react well either. Even so, Himeko&#8217;s lecture went on as if she didn&#8217;t care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh, this is the same as when I was a child.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was a child, he would sometimes get pushed around by the selfish Himeko. When he realized that this was the same scene as then, Hayato couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle deep in his throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s monopoly continued, and Hayato became a nodding machine to the occasional comment, while Haruki became a device that rolled her eyes and blew smoke out of her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when they looked at each other, they were all smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―That&#8217;s all. Ah, I&#8217;m so thirsty from all the talking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t offered you anything. Would you like a cup of tea?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki got up and headed downstairs to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato let out a big sigh and stretched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko gave her brother a reproachful look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, Haru-chan is indeed Haru-chan, but she&#8217;s also a girl, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a terrible thing to say.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on, you should go help her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While replying absent-mindedly, Hayato stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remembered the feeling of Haruki on his arm and other parts of his body when Himeko told him to help her. He also didn&#8217;t want his sister to see his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he descended the stairs, he scratched his head to cover up the complicated feelings that were swirling in his chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about it, he had never been in a room other than Haruki&#8217;s, but he knew immediately where the kitchen was. The door was slightly open, letting in some light, and it was easy to see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki, I&#8217;ll help you carry it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s voice leaked out, and Hayato&#8217;s eyes caught a glimpse of what lay behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a typical LDK, with the kitchen overlooking the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the common shape, the living room could not hide its alien atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were stacks of flyers and paper bags scattered about, the shutters were closed even though it was still light, and the furniture was covered in dust despite being very tidy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was obvious that the living room hadn&#8217;t been used by anyone for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning his gaze to the kitchen, he saw a large number of lunch containers and garbage bags filled with frozen food packaging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an eloquent testament to her current situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru, you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahahaha&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato&#8217;s mouth leaked words that were hard to describe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Haruki only smiled in a troubled way.</span></p>
