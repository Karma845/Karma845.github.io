<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; The Night Convenience Store</h3>

<p>It was at dinner that night.</p>
<p>[Onii, I want to go get some ice cream]</p>
<p>[Hm? If it’s ice cream then I think we have them]</p>
<p>Himeko suddenly said that.</p>
<p>Unsure of what his sister said, Hayato listened to his sister’s words and twirled the pasta around his fork, he looked satisfied.</p>
<p>Today’s dinner was pasta with ratatouille sauce, starring tomatoes, eggplants, and zucchini that he got as a gift.</p>
<p>It is a colorful dish with plenty of garlic, olive oil, paprika, and celery.</p>
<p>[Onii, I don’t want to eat ice cream, I want to buy ice cream]</p>
<p>[I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you are talking about. Why don’t you just go, then?]</p>
<p>[The night convenience store]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>[I want to go shopping at a convenience store at night]</p>
<p>[W-what&#8230;?]</p>
<p>A convenience store at night. This had a special meaning for both Hayato and Himeko, who until they moved here had only known about some privately owned convenience stores that opened at 11 and closed at 7.</p>
<p>In the first place, there are no stores that open at night in Tsukinose. People on Tsukinose don’t have the habit of going shopping at night.</p>
<p>Going out at night to buy something unimportant had a special meaning for the siblings, and it lifted their spirits.</p>
<p>[Onii, you’re coming with me, right?]</p>
<p>[Convenience store at night, huh? Yeah, we have to experience it at least once.]</p>
<p>[Uu… I’m getting nervous. I don’t know what I should wear… My uniform is fine, but I’ll get arrested, right?]</p>
<p>[Can’t you look that stuff up on the internet?]</p>
<p>[I-don’t know how&#8230;]</p>
<p>The two of them were strangely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>It was just before 8pm</p>
<p>In Tsukinose, it was almost dark, but in the city, it was still early evening.</p>
<p>For Hayato and Himeko, 8 pm was a time when they wouldn’t have gone out unless there was some urgency.</p>
<p>They felt as if they were doing something wrong. But at the same time, they were excited to go on an adventure.</p>
<p>[I guess you don’t need a flashlight at night here]</p>
<p>[It’s bright… though you can’t see any stars]</p>
<p>[But Himeko, that clothing&#8230;]</p>
<p>She was dressed in a off-the-shoulder tight Tshirt that fits with summer. She also wore some light makeup and looked like she was going on a date rather than going to a convenience store. In contrast to Hayato who was only wearing a shirt and denims.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into this. I don&#8217;t want people to think I&#8217;m a hick]</p>
<p>[Ha&#8230;]</p>
<p>With Himeko, Hayato walk through a residential area.</p>
<p>Instead of the stars and the moon, the street lights illuminate the streets, and instead of insects and frogs, they can only hear the sound of cars driving.</p>
<p>The night scenery is so different from daytime that Hayato feel as if he has wandered into another world.</p>
<p>Himeko was also nervous, grabbing the shirt on Hayato’s back and following him hesitantly.</p>
<p>They walked for over ten minutes, which was a little too long for both of them since they’re nervous. They arrived at their destination on the outskirts of the residential area, facing the main street.</p>
<p>[We’re finally here, the convenience store..]</p>
<p>[Yes we are, at the convenience store]</p>
<p>[We finally made it, huh?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, we finally made it]</p>
<p>It was still considered early in the night, and the place was full of customers on their way home from work, cram school, or just reading magazines to spend their time. It was just a run-of-the-mill convenience store.</p>
<p>But for Hayato and Himeko, it was different. They were even impressed. They felt so out of place that they hesitated whether they should really go in, and stood still at the entrance.</p>
<p>They looked at each other and were conversing with each other with their eyes, [You&#8217;re going, right?] [Go ahead,] etc.Then suddenly Himeko raised her voice</p>
<p>[Ah, look at that!]</p>
<p>[Hm?]</p>
<p>Hayato followed Himeko’s gaze and saw a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>She was wearing a large, loose-fitting shirt, skinny jeans, and a cassock hat, as if she had just come to the convenience store in her everyday clothes.</p>
<p>However, with her good looks, a beautiful girl can look good no matter what she wears.</p>
<p>[Ah]</p>
<p>[Yo&#8230;]</p>
<p>Haruki’s eyes widened as if she recognized them from Himeko’s voice. Then she smiled and came closer.</p>
<p>[Good evening, Kirishima-kun. What a coincidence, isn’t it?]</p>
<p>[Hm? Yeah, what a coincidence. Why are you here?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, I’m just doing some shopping. Anyway, she’s a pretty girl isn’t she? Is that your girlfriend?]</p>
<p>[Haa?]</p>
<p>[Hya?!]</p>
<p>Haruki smiled at Himeko. She&#8217;s showing a smile that just like a cat when wheedling with stranger, the one that can attracts even the people from the same sex</p>
<p>Himeko, who was shown such a destructive smile, blushed and hid behind Hayato’s back. Haruki then added, [Oh, you’re so cute~], her face gets even redder and she grabs Hayato’s shirt.</p>
<p>[You can’t leave Kirishima-kun in the corner, can’t you? I can’t believe that you got yourself a cute girlfriend right after transferring to a new school]</p>
<p>[Wait a second, you’re misunderstanding something here]</p>
<p>[Fufun… Don’t be shy]</p>
<p>[U-uhm, so you two know each other?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, we’re in the same class. We sit next to each other and I think I know a little bit more about him than anyone else. You can ask anything about him if you want.]</p>
<p>[Oh, I’m&#8230;.]</p>
<p>Something was not quite meshing.</p>
<p>Hayato let out a sigh when he saw the two of them having a unique Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p>[There’s something I need to let you know. Himeko, this girl here is Haruki. Haruki, this is Himeko]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[Pardon?]</p>
<p>And then, time stops for the two of them. Haruki and Himeko stare at each other intently.</p>
<p>[Haru… chan?]</p>
<p>[Hime… chan?]</p>
<p>[ [ EEEHH?? ] ]</p>
<p>The voices of two girls echoed at the entrance of the convenience store at night.</p>
