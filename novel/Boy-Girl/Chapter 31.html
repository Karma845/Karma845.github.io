<h3>Chapter 31 &#8211; Myaa?!</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Sunday morning, the day when Hayato and Haruki went out to pick out Hayato&#8217;s phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko, who had been occupying the TV in the Kirishima living room since early in the morning, looked suspiciously at her brother when she saw him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, the straw hat won&#8217;t do after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, really? What about heat stroke&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to the buildings, there are plenty of shadows and stores where you can rest and cool off&#8230; It&#8217;s not like Tsukinose where there&#8217;s nothing around, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plain shirt and denim bottoms. So far, so good. For better or worse, it&#8217;s a safe outfit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But going out with a straw hat on top of that, it was as if he was going to help out in the field. As expected, Himeko complained about it and couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about her brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That reminds me, why do we have to meet there? Our houses are so close, why don&#8217;t we just go there together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Hayato&#8217;s next words changed her conviction, &#8220;Oh, he doesn&#8217;t understand at all!&#8221;. Himeko stopped the recording and turned to face Hayato, where he flinched at the power of her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Listen, Onii, yesterday, I went shopping for clothes with Haru-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Oh, yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In other words, this is the first time Onii&#8217;s going to see it. Since that&#8217;s the case, we have to set up a proper stage for the unveiling. It can&#8217;t be in front of the house. Do you understand?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, is that how it is?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it is.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Hayato, who still looked somewhat uncomfortable, Himeko let out a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It&#8217;s a bit absurd to expect Onii to understand the heart of a maiden&#8230; Besides, Haru-chan is still Haru-chan after all.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko thought about her brother and her childhood friend, and then let out a sigh of exasperation once more― and turned to the television.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, Onii, don&#8217;t forget the papers on your desk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this Dad&#8217;s account&#8230; on the parental consent form?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve already stamped it on the DL. You&#8217;re going to use the same carrier as me, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Carrier?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cell phone company. You don&#8217;t know anything about that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. To bother you with this&#8230; Wha!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a strange voice escaped from Hayato&#8217;s mouth. His eyes were fixed on the TV. A similar voice leaked from Himeko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drama had just reached its climax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man and a woman are having an affair and are hugging each other in bed when the wife enters with a knife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very intense scene, and it was no wonder that Hayato was making strange noises. Himeko, as expected, flushed and froze in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Erm, well, what is it, is it popular right now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a drama called Ten Years of Solitude, and a girl in my class said it was funny! The actress is amazing! There are a lot of rumors about her in her personal life, like she&#8217;s a divorced woman or a woman in love, but that&#8217;s why she gives such a true performance&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Himeko.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yes, I will study for my exams in moderation.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Himeko was exposed to Hayato&#8217;s gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They met at the local station where the store was located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was three stops from the nearest station on a busy train he had ridden on, and an additional short 20-minute train ride away. It was the same station that Himeko and Haruki had visited yesterday, one of the largest in the region, and also the center of the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, where&#8217;s the east exit&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The station was like a maze of underground and above-ground stations served by several private railways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato had been surprised when he went to the hospital yesterday, but this was more than a surprise, it made him feel uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, crap, it&#8217;s already time! Now I&#8217;ll owe Haruki again!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato left the house to arrive at the meeting place 10 minutes early, but since it’s his first time going around the city, he couldn&#8217;t navigate around the station as much as he wanted and felt as if he was lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time he managed to get to the meeting place near the bird object, he was at least five minutes late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was Sunday, the place was overflowing with people and it would be difficult to find Haruki with pinpoint accuracy. For the first time, Hayato felt the need to use his smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Sh*t, I&#8217;m done for&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He raised one hand and tried to call out loudly, knowing that Haruki would be angry with him later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There you are!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was suddenly embraced by a girl, who pulled him towards her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind her, two frivolous-looking men were chasing after her. No matter how you look at it, it was some kind of pick-up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell, are they really with a guy?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Rather than being so late, why don&#8217;t you come with us?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a beautiful girl who stood out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fresh white summer dress with ruffles on the hem with distinctive shoulder straps, flowing black hair braided into a half-updo, she looked like some kind of innocent young lady, a beautiful girl that Hayato had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a girl like her was waiting alone, it would be difficult not to call out to her as they did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, wait!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She forcefully pulled Hayato&#8217;s arm and tried to lead him outside. She seemed to want to get away from the two men who were picking her up, so she pulled his arm very hard and walked with her legs wide apart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato couldn&#8217;t react to the suddenness of the situation and was left to his own devices. He was completely confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato is an adolescent boy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way he wouldn&#8217;t be thrilled to have a beautiful girl like her in his arms. And if he could feel the softness of her breasts on his arm, it was understandable that he would blush.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as he walked with her arm around him, he felt a strange sense of déjà vu. He felt a strange sense of familiarity. When he looked at the disgruntled face looking back at him from time to time, his suspicion turned to certainty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki, is that you&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes after getting out of the station, Haruki, a beautiful girl, finally stopped and left his arms and turned around, making an angry face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mou~! Hayato, you&#8217;re late! I&#8217;ve been waiting to surprise Hayato, and now you&#8217;re going to surprise me by picking me up, and that sucks!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, for that, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; The station is too big and I got lost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I told you, a smartphone is a necessity and you shouldn&#8217;t be without it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I know that firsthand now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He can&#8217;t quite put his finger on it, but Haruki&#8217;s cheeks were puffed up and she looked different from usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parts of her face looked the same as usual, but the way she was dressed made her look more attractive than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s face looked the same as usual, but she looked more attractive than usual. Hayato turned his face away from her. Even her br**sts were buzzing annoyingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki found out about Hayato&#8217;s blush, and the anger she had felt earlier disappeared as she grinned mischievously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oyaoya~&#8230; Could it be that, you&#8217;re embarrassed by looking at me, Hayato?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha&#8230;!? It&#8217;s nothing! Are you even wearing makeup today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, you got it. It&#8217;s my first time doing so, but I did my best. What do you think?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Haruki turned her body around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2229 size-full" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c31-illus.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="859" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c31-illus.jpg 610w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c31-illus-213x300.jpg 213w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c31-illus-75x106.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her long, black, well-groomed hair flowed about her, and the short, lacy skirt of her dress spread out softly, revealing a glimpse of her healthily toned white thighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato scratched his head as if to deceive her, but it was impossible to hide his agitation from Haruki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convinced of her victory, Haruki smiled contentedly and even tried to take Hayato&#8217;s arm to make more fun of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s very cute&#8230; and yes&#8230; it looks great on you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Myaa!?&#8221;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Haruki&#8217;s face instantly boils redder than Hayato&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the true feeling that came out of Hayato&#8217;s mouth when he was overwhelmed. Haruki knew that, that&#8217;s why he understood it completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who had been hit by such a strong counter in her defenseless state, turned her eyes around as emotions arose for the first time in her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He-he-he-here&#8217;s the thing, you know, yeah, that&#8217;s it! Th-th-that, that thing, Hayato!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s right, you know, you wore that for me just to show me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;~~~~! No&#8230; that&#8217;s not it! That&#8217;s&#8230; Myaaaaaaaaaaa~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha-Haruki!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go! Let&#8217;s just go there and choose a model quickly!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who was more overwhelmed than Hayato, forcibly pulled Hayato&#8217;s hand and walked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them were somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, as they walked, they began to calm down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, their faces were still red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s not going to rehash the conversation. But Haruki whispered something that she really wanted to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Thanks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was blue with not a single cloud visible in the vast sky, and it was going to be hot again today.</span></p>
