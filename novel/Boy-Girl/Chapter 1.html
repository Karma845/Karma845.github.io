<h1>Chapter 1 - The Hidden Side of Everyone's Friend</h1>


<p>Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>If there were a trend ranking at this Aisu Academy, her name would consistently be at the top.</p>

<p>“Ah, Tomo-chan! Thanks for helping me with my problem last week!”</p>
<p>“You should say thank you too, Takakura?  Thanks to Tomori, you finally got to go out with a college student you’ve been interested in…! “</p>
<p>“As expected of Azusa! You always manage to solve our problems!”</p>

<p>In the morning classroom, as soon as she arrived at school, Tomori received enthusiastic welcomes from several girls.</p>
<p>It’s because for someone like her, who is [Everyone’s friend.] it’s an everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>“But I’m glad for you, Takakura. It’s great that Tomori is on your side instead of being a rival.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, if Azusa were a love rival, there would be no chance for me…”</p>
<p>“If I were to compare Tomo-chan to something, she’s like an unattainable flower… No, that’s not quite right.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Tomo-chan is the complete opposite of an unattainable flower.”</p>

<p>I agreed with my classmates’ words.</p>
<p>The term “unattainable flower” refers to something that is distant and out of reach or something that is very expensive.</p>

<p>Tomori, on the other hand, is within everyone’s reach. </p>
<p>In other words――</p>

<p>“Chifuyu’s right. I’m just a wildflower.”</p>

<p>With a humble but dazzling smile, Tomori said so.</p>
<p>Right, she is not an unattainable flower.</p>

<p>(But she’s not just an ordinary wildflower either.)</p>

<p>If I were to use dandelion as a metaphor, she would be the most beautiful dandelion in the world.</p>
<p>If she bloomed by the roadside, everyone would instinctively stop and gather around. </p>
<p>That’s how captivating Tomori was, to the point where I couldn’t help but think of such things.</p>

<p>She wasn’t an otherworldly beauty.</p>
<p>Still, her large friendly eyes always caught people’s attention.</p>
<p>Her chestnut-colored bob cut neatly trimmed at the shoulder and a bright red ribbon.</p>
<p>She is rather small in stature, but her excellent body line is still evident in her school uniform.</p>

<p>Above all, her smile was special.</p>
<p>Her smile, full of charm, could easily melt even the coldest hearts. </p>

<p>As I said before, she wasn’t a beauty in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>But she was undeniably a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>There was a phrase that became popular some time ago: [An idol you can meet.]. However, Azusa Tomori is the [Idol you can be friends with] at Aisu Academy.</p>

<p>“Hey, Azusa, can you show me your homework?”</p>
<p>“Ah, um, Azusa-chan, would you come and help out at the board game club this weekend? We want you to participate in the tournament with us… We’re short on members, and we’re in trouble…”</p>
<p>“Tomori, Tomori! Let’s hang out next time! The senpai from the club keeps pestering me to invite you too!”</p>
<p>“Okay! Is the homework for the second-period math? I’ll lend you my notes, so make sure to copy them properly. I’ll definitely participate in the board game tournament! It would be great if we had games like Gatan or Sonnukaruka as events. Ah, and about hanging out…I’ll pass this time.”</p>
<p>“What? Why am I the only one being turned down?”</p>
<p>“Is that senpai you’re talking about, Fujishiro from the soccer club?”</p>
<p>“How do you know… Wait! Did Fujishiro Senpai confess to you or something?”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying that he did, though.”</p>

<p>Tomori denied it with a smile.</p>

<p>But our classmates noticed.</p>
<p>What she just said must have been a lie to show her consideration for Fujishiro Senpai. </p>

<p>(This pattern again?)</p>

<p>If there is one flaw in Azusa Tomori, it’s her guardedness in not dating anyone despite having many friends, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>It seems like Fujishiro-senpai also asked Tomori to be in a relationship with him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he couldn’t shake the goal net out of her heart. </p>
<p>However, he couldn’t give up and tried to use his juniors to challenge Tomori to an extra round. </p>

<p>“Hey! Seriously, is it Fujishiro-senpai?”</p>
<p>“He’s the ace of the soccer club! And his parent is a congressman! He’s one of the best-looking kids in the third grade, what a waste! “</p>
<p>“How many people are there this year?”</p>
<p>“A lawyer’s son, heir to a major game company, currently a model under a talent agency…”</p>
<p>“The Azusa Heartbroken Club just got more luxurious!”</p>

<p>It was certainly an extravagant lineup.</p>
<p>In the first place, this academy has many students with such titles, because Aisu Academy is one of the top advanced schools in Kanagawa Prefecture, with an average deviation value of over 70.</p>

<p>The school offers an integrated education from elementary school to university. </p>
<p>Although it is a young school with a short history, established by the prestigious Aisu University several decades ago, its reputation has reached far beyond Japan. </p>
<p>It has produced top elites in various industries. </p>

<p>At the same time, the tuition fee is quite high, so only students with luxurious titles like the ones I saw earlier attend.</p>
<p>And Azusa Tomori is at the top of such honor students.</p>

<p>(Her family background may be ordinary, but her specs are overwhelmingly excellent.)</p>

<p>She ranks second in her class.</p>
<p>Despite being in the homecoming club, she has superhuman physical abilities that place her in the top ranks nationally in sports tests.</p>
<p>There is an anecdote that she received a special offer from the student council within the first week of enrollment due to her exceptional talent.</p>

<p>What’s even more surprising is that despite having such extraordinary status, she treats everyone, from outgoing sports boys to introverted indoor girls, with the same friendliness.</p>

<p>[Everyone’s friend.]</p>

<p>It’s understandable why she is called that with so many friends.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you start tweeting or Instagramming? You’ll get more people crushing on you. “</p>
<p>“No way~. I’m not good with SNS (social networking), so unless there’s a really good reason, I won’t do it… Oh, by the way, I heard the teacher will be late, so shall we study on our own?”</p>

<p>Under Tomori’s beautiful command, the students begin preparing for self-study in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Thus, another peaceful day begins. </p>

<p>The class is united under the perfect class president, who is both literate and skilled. </p>

<p>“――Now, what are you doing, Kimitaka Kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>Yes, except for about one person. </p>

<p>“I’m reading a manga that was released today.”</p>

<p>While reading an e-book on my smartphone, I responded in a low voice to Tomori, who spoke to me from my next seat.</p>

<p>“If you keep reading manga all the time, your grades will drop, you know?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. This is just a way to take a break.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s true that you attend classes properly.”</p>
<p>“I also do my homework and review seriously.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Then why don’t you take your role as a class representative seriously?”</p>

<p>Her cynicism was in stark contrast to the brightness she had shown earlier.</p>
<p>Tomori smiled like an angel but spoke like a devil.</p>

<p>“Noisy.”</p>
<p>“If your grades are good, I guess you couldn’t care less about the class, you individualist.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right, you totalitarian.”</p>
<p>“Your attitude is still as rotten as ever. Did you consume some fermented food that went to your head?”</p>
<p>“Correct. Jealous, aren’t you? Coming from someone like you with an empty mind.”</p>

<p>An exchange of unabashed insults. This is my daily life with Tomori.</p>

<p>“Everyone is saying it. If Tomori were here, Kagisaka can just be a vice-president in name.”</p>
<p>“No, I want to make you an example for everyone. Although your grades are excellent, I want to show everyone your bottom-of-the-barrel existence as a human being so that everyone can grow and――”</p>
<p>“Talkative bitch.” (Blue text in the illus below.) </p>
<p>“!?… Aren’t you supposed to say ‘beautiful’?”</p>
<p>“You get along with everyone, so ‘bitch’ suits you better.”</p>
<p>“Too harsh! The worst! Trash!”</p>
<p>“Your tone is quite harsh too.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, this is why you can’t make friends, you Bocchi-kun (loner).” (Red text in the illus.)</p>
<p>“Ugh!? Even I have a few friends…”</p>
<p>“They’re probably just net geeks’ friends, right? Just a relationship where you follow each other on Twitter. If it were me, I would block someone like you, an individualist, and exclude you from the community.”</p>
<p>“…Hey, why are you so foul-mouthed?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>Tomori pointed at me with a thin white finger.</p>

<p>“I only become rude when it comes to you, Kagisaka-kun.”</p>

<p>She stuck out the tip of her bright red tongue just a little bit.</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/T1.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>Oh, I mentioned earlier that Azusa Tomori had only one flaw, but let me correct that. </p>
<p>Besides rejecting romantic relationships with everyone, there’s another negative point about her.</p>
<p>She constantly spews out harsh words and a sharp tongue, but only towards me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>“Oh? Did Kagisaka get another snide remark again?”</p>
<p>“It’s unusual, isn’t it? Azusa is always kind to everyone, but she becomes harsh with him.”</p>
<p>“Well, Kagisaka has zero cooperation, so I guess it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>Whispers could be heard from the sidelines.</p>

<p>“Why is Kagisaka the vice-president in the first place? “</p>
<p>“Well, he has good grades. He’s always at the top of the class.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that’s why Kuonji-sensei nominated him.”</p>
<p>“Azusa is in second place. But he is…”</p>
<p>“Right, isn’t that why Tomori dislikes him? He’s a problem child with no friends.”</p>

<p>The perfect class president who are friends with everyone and the loner vice-president who doesn’t make connections with anyone.</p>
<p>That’s the reputation of Azusa Tomori and Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>

<p>“Hey, Loner boy! (Bocchi-kun)”</p>

<p>Tomori whispered in a voice that couldn’t be heard by anyone else but me.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you frustrated that everyone said that to you? “</p>
<p>“Not really? It’s the truth. Besides, you dislike me too, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I hate people who have the ability but don’t show any motivation. You, who are always at the top of the class, leave all the class representative work to me…”</p>
<p>“It was Tomori who said, ‘You don’t have to do your work.”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>[That was…] Tomori faltered and couldn’t respond.</p>

<p>[If you’re not motivated, you don’t have to do the class representative’s job.]</p>

<p>Just last month. A few weeks after I was elected as a member of this 2-A class representative after moving up to the next grade, Tomori told me.</p>

<p>[Kagisaka-kun, you don’t seem to enjoy working with me at all.]</p>

<p>She pursed her lips in a sulky manner. </p>

<p>(Well, to be fair, being a class representative wasn’t enjoyable.)</p>

<p>It’s not that I didn’t like being with Tomori.</p>
<p>It’s just that because of the many things that happened in junior high school, I became inexplicably bad at organizing a large group of people.</p>

<p>“I don’t regret anything I said. It’s your lack of motivation that’s to blame.”</p>

<p>Tomori sighed and turned her face away.</p>

<p>(It’s convenient to have someone who can speak their mind like this.)</p>

<p>Tomori is [Everyone’s friend.]</p>
<p>She often approaches me in the classroom, wanting to reform me, but if she becomes particularly close to me, I’ll face backlash from the hundreds of her friends.</p>
<p>If we exchange playful banter like this, there won’t be any jealousy. Perhaps Tomori herself understands that.</p>

<p>However, being on bad terms with the [Everyone’s friend.] may also leave a bit negative impression on those around me… </p>

<p>(But I don’t mind.)</p>

<p>There’s no need to care about other people’s opinions, and it’s true I’m quite an individualistic loner. </p>
<p>Even if I can’t become friends with [Everyone’s friend.] it won’t hinder my school life.</p>

<p>――At least, that’s what I thought until a few days ago.</p>

<p>[Why did you say such a thing?]</p>

<p>In these past few days, the situation has changed significantly.</p>

<p>[When I said ‘you don’t have to do the job’. It was a way to spur him into action, I didn’t expect him to stop doing it for real.]</p>
<p>[I just can’t be honest, and my mouth becomes foul.]</p>
<p>[It’s a problem to be too friendly, but that was clearly going too far… I won’t be able to become K-kun’s friend like this…]</p>

<p>These are the soliloquies displayed on my smartphone. They are tweets I happened to stumble upon recently.</p>

<p>[That’s it!]</p>

<p>Following that tweet, a sky-blue pen fell from Tomori’s desk. Or rather, it was casually dropped in my direction.</p>

<p>[Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!]</p>

<p>Tomori acts as if she didn’t notice the dropped pen… as she pretended to and tapped on her red smartphone. Then, she glanced at me expectantly.</p>
<p>Her behavior reminded me of a puppy that earnestly appeals to its owner by holding a toy in its mouth, wanting to play.</p>

<p>“Hey, Tomori. You dropped your pen.”</p>

<p>But… the basketball club member sitting behind Tomori quickly rescued the pen from the floor.</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you, I didn’t notice that! ! ” </p>

<p>Tomori wore a friendly smile, but as soon as she turned to the front, she looked at the sky-blue pen with a sullen expression on her face.</p>

<p>She looked like a puppy, after all.</p>
<p>Like a small golden retriever sulking because it couldn’t get its owner to play.</p>

<p>[…Stupid. You could have picked it up.]</p>

<p>Furthermore, on her alternate account, she expressed grievances against me.</p>

<p>(Oh, for God’s sake. Don’t give me that look.)</p>

<p>Although I thought I shouldn’t help her, feeling guilty due to her cute pouting, I accidentally dropped my eraser.</p>

<p>Instantly, Tomori’s body trembled.</p>
<p>‘What’s that? Did you drop your eraser? Didn’t you notice?’ I felt she was asking me something like that with her eyes, but I waited.</p>

<p>After a silence of several seconds, unable to bear it any longer, Tomori reluctantly picked up the eraser.</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun, this…”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to trouble you by picking it up――”</p>
<p>“I thought I found some trash. Can I throw it away? “</p>
<p>“Sorry, but it looks like it’s my eraser?”</p>
<p>“What? No way! I touched it! The loner bacteria will spread, and my Line friends will drop to zero! Even though there are more than 300 of them!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations. This is an opportunity to declutter your bloated social circle.”</p>

<p>After exchanging banter, I retrieve the eraser from Tomori’s hand.</p>
<p>Then, pretending to look at a comic book, I turn to my phone.</p>

<p>[Whoooaaaaaa! ]</p>

<p>Her account was in a frenzy.</p>

<p>[I touched it～! Omg! K-kun’s fingertips touched my hand!]</p>
<p>[Wow, that’s dangerous! I’m smiling!]</p>
<p>[If K-kun sees me, he’ll definitely think I’m a crazy girl! ]</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I already have such an opinion.</p>
<p>After all, she, Azusa Tomori, earnestly expresses her true feelings on social media.</p>

<p>Her account name is ‘<strong>tomochan</strong>‘.</p>
<p>Zero followers and zero following.</p>
<p>The account is not private, but it’s as if it has been left behind in a neglected corner of the internet.</p>
<p>There are no tweets revealing her real name or personal information.</p>

<p>(In other words, it’s a secret account.)</p>

<p>However, the problem is that the account belongs to the sharp-tongued girl sitting next to me.</p>

<p>“…No. “</p>

<p>It’s not a problem.</p>

<p>(Everyone has a hidden side they don’t show to others.)</p>

<p>I’m no exception.</p>
<p>So, I can just ignore it.</p>
<p>Even though I peeked at her tweets today and inadvertently fulfilled Tomori’s wish, all I have to do now is to step aside…</p>

<p>[Ahhh, K-kun, I love you after all!]</p>

<p>?</p>

<p>[Love you, I love you, I really love you! I’m the only one who knows the real you…a reliable and kind person…]</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>[Ah, if it’s on my secret account, I can freely express how much I love you. I wonder what kind of expression you’d make if I told you?]</p>

<p>…What kind of expression, you ask?</p>
<p>If you turn your head right now, you’ll know the answer.</p>

<p>“Huh? Kagisaka-kun, are you okay?”</p>

<p>Tomori, with an unusual concern, asked as if she became cheerful after interacting with K-kun.</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0008_T2.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/T2.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Is your face a bit red? Are you feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>
<p>“Stop pretending to be concerned about me and trying to sell me your favors, bitch!”</p>
<p>“Huh?! What’s with that attitude? Your personality is still rotten, as usual!”</p>

<p>[Sometimes, it would be nice if you could just be honest!] Tomori muttered quietly.</p>
<p>Well, maybe if I could honestly say, [I know about your secret account.] it would make things easier.</p>

<p>But I can’t do that yet.</p>

<p>Even though she acts completely uninterested, all of her true feelings are exposed to me.</p>
<p>If she were to learn about this embarrassingly shameful reality, she might refuse to go to school or, at worst, hang herself out of sheer embarrassment.</p>

<p>(How did it come to this?)</p>

<p>I wanted to let out a deep sigh, but I knew the cause.</p>

<p>It was a mere 58 hours ago.</p>
<p>It happened when I didn’t know what [Everyone’s friend.] true face looked like.</p>
