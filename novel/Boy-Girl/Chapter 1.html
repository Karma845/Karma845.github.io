<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The One Sitting Next to me, Nikaido-san</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s all started when I was just a kid</p><p>[We&#8217;ll always be friends, right, Hayato?]</p><p>[Yeah, we&#8217;ll always be friends, Haruki! ]</p><p>The sunflowers blooming in the garden, the empty bottle of lemonade, and the sound of the cicadas chirping</p><p>On a late summer evening in the countryside, I made a small promise to my best friend</p><p>Intertwining our pinkies together, we wish for a reunion before a farewell we have no choice but to face</p><p>Seven years have passed since then</p><p>[It&#8217;s huge...]</p><p>I, Hayato Kirishima was suddenly aware of this as I looked at my new high school.</p><p>The school I moved to was much bigger and prettier than the one in the countryside, which almost made my eyes roll back in my head</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think about the things I&#8217;ve missed in my past days</p><p>Anyway, not wanting to remain overwhelmed, I pulled myself together and headed to the staff room</p><p>It seemed that all the procedures had already been completed, so I headed straight to the classroom with my homeroom teacher.</p><p>Above the door was a plate with &#8220;1-A&#8221; written on it</p>
<p>From the entrance, gazes of interest pierce through me, making me nervous</p>
<p>[My name&#8217;s Hayato, Kirishima Hayato. I&#8217;m a country bumpkin from Tsukinose, a place where you might see monkeys, deer, and boars on the road]</p><p>I introduced myself in such a self-deprecating way, and although I&#8217;m not proud of it, my expression was such that my classmates started to laugh</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief since my first day at my new school was going well</p><p>Since I was moving from the countryside to the city, moreover it was in the middle of June, I felt a little uneasy about that</p><p>Still, there were some things I was excited about</p><p>The fact that I was moving to the same town as Haruki Nikaido, the person I made a promise to when I was a kid made me excited. There might be a chance to meet him</p><p>[For your seat&#8230;. Is there an empty seat next to Nikaido?]</p><p>(Nikaido&#8230; eh?)</p><p>[Yes]</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One of the female student raised her hand and gestured, &#8220;Here you go&#8221;</p><p>She was a very beautiful girl</p><p>She has big, round eyes and long, well-groomed hair that&#8217;s braided in tufts on each side</p><p>The way she smiles at me is as lovely as a bud that&#8217;s blossoming to a flower</p><p>She&#8217;s a neat and lovely girl who seemed mature and the word &#8220;Yamato Nadeshiko&#8221; suited her well. (TL Note: &#8220;Yamato Nadeshiko&#8221; is a japanese term meaning the personification of an idealized Japanese woman)</p><p>On the contrary, the face of my best friend came to mind as I thought, [Oh, this girl is also called Nikaido, just like that guy] &#8221;</p><p>He was a good-natured guy, he might try to approach her and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s fate that we have the same last name&#8221;</p><p>When I thought about it, a giggle escaped my lips and I started to choke&#12288;</p><p>[I&#8217;ll be in your care, Nidokai-san]</p><p>She looked a bit surprised at my reaction, but for a moment, she responded with a mischievous smile that was somewhat friendly</p><p>[I&#8217;ll be in your care, Kirishima-kun]</p>
<p>I felt nostalgic for some reason when she squinted her eyes at me</p><p>(Huh, Why did I feel nostalgic?)</p><p>I tilted my head, trying to think. But my classmates started to approach me</p><p>[Hey, Kirishima-kun, is it true what you said in your introduction?]</p><p>[How remote is that place, seriously?]</p><p>[How did you end up coming here from such a place?]</p><p>As soon as homeroom was over, I was surrounded by my classmates and was subjected to baptism of fire in the form of questions about me</p>

<p>[Uhm, the reason I changed schools was because of my father&#8217;s sudden job transfer. The last place I lived was deep in the mountains, where there were only 4 buses a day, and we had more livestock than people&#8230; Honestly, I&#8217;ve never been surrounded by so many things besides chickens and sheeps, so I&#8217;m a bit surprised]</p><p>When I shrugged my shoulders after I said something like that, my classmates started to laugh and some of them said something like: [What&#8217;s that?], [Really?], [That&#8217;s funny!]</p>
<p>I have a good impression of my classmates, and it seemed that my classmates also felt the same way. So they started to ask me more and more questions</p>
<p>[DIdn&#8217;t you have any girlfriend or something over there?]</p><p><br /></p><p>[It&#8217;s harder to find someone your own age, not to mention, a girlfriend]</p>
<p>[Do you have any friends? What did you do for fun?]</p>
<p>[Basically, I was either alone or helping out in the fields&#8230; Oh! There was a guy who used to be a good friend of mine. He made me jump to the river with him from a bridge, climbed a tree in the mountain and fell down when he couldn&#8217;t get down, I think he was more of a bad monkey or some monster rather than a friend]</p>
<p>I talked about these things as I replayed my memories with Haruki.</p>
<p>If I were to say anything, all I remember is being dragged around and pushed around all the time. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not really good, but it definitely was a fun memories</p>
<p>*snap*</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p><p>[...Ah]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but at the same time as we were speaking, I heard the sound of something being snapped from beside me</p>
<p>Everyone turned their attention to the direction of the sound source</p>
<p>It was Nikaido-san in the seat next to me</p>
<p>In her hand was a mechanical pencil snapped in the middle&#12288;</p>
<p>Nikaido-san herself looked surprised, too</p>
<p>A beautiful, innocent girl who looks like a &#8220;Yamato Nadeshiko&#8221; and a broken mechanical pencil in her hand</p>

<p>With this unfamiliar situation, my classmates were more concerned about her than the questions they were about to ask</p>
<p>[Nikaido-san?]</p>
<p>[Uhm, that&#8230; what happened?]</p>
<p>[Are you okay? Are you hurt?]</p>
<p>[Ahaha, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m fine. This pencil was a bit defective]</p>

<p>She decided to ask me a question as if she was trying to cover something up. Her face was a little tinged with disapproval</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s quite a way to talk about a dear friend]</p>
<p>[Haha, that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s my best friend]</p>
<p>[Oh, I see]</p>
<p>I answered Nikaido-san whilst thinking about my memories with Haruki</p><p>After that, she turned her face away with a pout</p>
