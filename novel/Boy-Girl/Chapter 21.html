<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Halfsies</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iyaa~, thank you for the help, Hayato!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　Lunch break. Haruki was hitting Hayato on the back, probably to hide her embarrassment over what happened this morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ouch, ouch! Show a little restraint at least&#8230; What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nude cushion?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Haruki took out of her bag was a small, white, uncovered cushion. There were two small cushions that had been forcibly squeezed into a small space, but were slowly expanding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, the small one without a cover. They were sold at a hundred-yen store, though they were 200 yen. Here, for Hayato.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, it&#8217;s a hundred-yen store, so why is it 200 yen!? Oh, that&#8217;s right, money.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No problem, I owe you this much. But I have a small favor to ask&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah? What the― heck!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki hugged the nude cushion she was about to give to Hayato on her chest and rubbed her cheeks with a blush, squirming and looking up at her. It was adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very girlish gesture. But her eyes were smiling mischievously, and it was obvious that she was playing a prank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he knew it was just a joke, it had enough charm to make him swoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato exaggeratedly turned his head in an attempt not to let her know how he felt, but Haruki saw his overreaction and began to giggle, and as if to give chase, she leaned in closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want Hayato&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You want me to say that&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha-Haruki, you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it&#8217;s just to make fun of him, Hayato can&#8217;t hide his agitation when he&#8217;s pressed by a shameful but sensitive word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she knew this, Haruki put a finger to her lips in a seductive way and gently traced her hand holding Hayato&#8217;s bag. An inexplicable sensation runs down his spine. Even the mischievous eyes that catch Hayato&#8217;s are mesmerizing. He swallowed his spit with a gulp, as if he was no match for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―*Crack</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then a huge belch echoed through the room. Hayato looked at Haruki, who was hiding her face in the cushion, with the eyes of a regretful creature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, because I was on the edge this morning, too! I didn&#8217;t even eat breakfast, and I couldn&#8217;t even buy lunch!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa~, Good grief&#8230; you owe me one okay? I&#8217;d be happy to share but I don&#8217;t have any other chopsticks. As you can see, I can&#8217;t lend you mine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, no problem. I&#8217;ve still got a few left over from the convenience store that I keep in my bag.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato was a little disappointed, but also relieved, as he lifted the lid of his bento. It&#8217;s hard to eat only half a bento when it’s in the middle of the day, but it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was something else that bothered him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they had met at the supermarket before, she had bought a lot of frozen food, and also when they had met last night, she had gone to the convenience store to buy some food. And the house that he saw last night when they parted was completely dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t seem to be able to imagine much better than the food situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This hamburger steak with lots of vegetables is delicious. Did Hayato make this too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I made a big batch the other day and froze it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it any different when it&#8217;s frozen? Also, you look a little weird.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only when Haruki mentioned it that Hayato realized that his thoughts were showing on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person in front of him was his childhood friend with whom he used to laugh and share ice cream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki looked at Hayato with a frown of fear on her face, as if she had done something wrong. She looked like a child who was afraid of being scolded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;―I was just dumbfounded, what were you guys talking about, staying up so late getting excited?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato&#8230; ah, haha, a lot of things. Yes, a lot. Himeko-chan is quite an expert about clothing brands and cosmetic products, and she was scolding me because I didn&#8217;t know anything about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hee~, that&#8217;s surprising. Well, that&#8217;s surprising, since you&#8217;re such a good mimic, so I thought&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m just playing the good girl role. Besides― even I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Haruki?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah! No, it&#8217;s nothing!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Haruki forced herself to cover it up. It&#8217;s obvious that she wasn&#8217;t listening to him. The dark expression that she showed for a moment was very similar to the one he had felt when they parted last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(―That doesn&#8217;t suit you!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Hayato, Haruki had always been a prankster, a forceful person, and also a very cheerful person with a great smile. Even now, after seven years, that hasn&#8217;t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the gap of seven years was too long, and they have been accumulating things that neither of them knows. It has separated Haruki and Hayato&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He doesn&#8217;t know what happened. He&#8217;s also sure that it&#8217;s not something that can be easily said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato is well aware of this, and that&#8217;s why he hesitates to take a step towards Haruki because of that&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he really wanted to let her know that he cared, and more than anything, he thought of Himeko at that time, and when he realized it, he scratched Haruki&#8217;s head forcefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha, wait, Hayato, what are you doing!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki was surprised by the sudden action and shouted in protest. But the look on Hayato&#8217;s face made it impossible for her to say anything, so she did as she was told, even though it took a certain amount of effort to do her hair every morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato also made an indescribable expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short, tangled, sun-damaged hair that used to sting her hands is now long, smooth, and silky to the touch, tickling between her fingertips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki―&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Are you okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Ask me if you need anything, okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I&#8217;ll be here for you&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he tried to say something, a number of words floated through Hayato&#8217;s mind, only to disappear when he felt something was wrong. Only his feelings are spinning, and he feels frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki looked at Hayato&#8217;s hundred-faced face and chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki smiled and said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the outside, it was a very short exchange. But it was enough for the two of them to understand each other. He said that this was all he needed for now. His face was somewhat satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed, haven&#8217;t you, Hayato?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Have I?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;ve gotten cocky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha? What&#8217;s up with that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aha, I wonder what it is?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early summer sky seen from the window, the same curling clouds float as before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countryside and the city. A blank time. Many things have changed, and he was frustrated with his partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the two of them laughed and shared the same things, just as they had in the past.</span></p>
