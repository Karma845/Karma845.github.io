<h3>Chapter 30 &#8211; Did you Lie to me?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko came home just before 7 p.m., when the sun was about to set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m home~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Welcome home. Where&#8217;s Haruki?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She said she was too tired to come over and eat today, so settle down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruki&#8217;s running out of energy&#8230; What the hell has she been doing&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just normal shopping?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato looked at Himeko suspiciously, but her face was somewhat glowing and she looked satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko sniffed and confirmed what she was having for dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Curry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, that includes tomorrow night&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm~, let me know when it&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in her room, Himeko threw her bag on the floor and fell into bed with a thud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s face was grinning as she recalled the day&#8217;s events with a lingering smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time she had gone out to play in the city had been quite a shock to Himeko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike in Tsukinose, a countryside, there were an inordinate number of train cars and a complicated station building where you could get lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she looked around, she saw a wide variety of cars other than light trucks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there are buildings that stretch out vertically instead of horizontally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko&#8217;s spirits were skyrocketing from this morning as she saw the very city she had always dreamed of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoaa~, amazing&#8230; where the heck do I even start looking around&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu, you can get there efficiently and without wasting time by laddering up the stores along Chuo-Dori and then going around the perimeter to the department store at the end of the street!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan, for someone who was so reluctant until yesterday, you&#8217;re really determined, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Once I decide to do something, I have to do it thoroughly! That way I could surprise Hayato, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I guess so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who was more excited than Himeko was Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s mischievous smiling face, coupled with her freshly designed tunic and shorts, which gave her an air of innocence, made the gap between her and the rest of the audience a bit of a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, the outfit was made by Himeko, and the tunic was her personal property. Seeing Haruki like this made her think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(All the best for Onii, huh&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you dressed up like a girl and made Onii go crazy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what Himeko overheard at Haruki&#8217;s house the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s true that Himeko was the one who set Haruki on fire. Since the purpose was to torment Hayato, this reaction was natural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Haruki like this, Himeko felt a little bit of jealousy welling up in her― she slapped her face to cover it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re really into it, Hime-chan!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, we&#8217;re going to go all out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Ohh!!!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the two girls, in high tension, went through various stores and examined them. It was fun to see Haruki get sucked into the game store, the yellow submarine store, and the gacha gacha corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way, they went to a fruit parlor that had a good reputation on the Internet, where they each ate a jumbo fruit parfait as big as their faces, and enjoyed chatting with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki and Himeko went around the stores in an orderly fashion, but the only miscalculation they had was that they kept going back and forth because they wanted to combine various items from different stores.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, who had been very excited, ran out of energy on the train ride home and ended up resting her head on Himeko&#8217;s shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko felt her cheeks relax at the sight of Haruki in such a defenseless state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It was fun&#8230; oh?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was basking in the afterglow of the day, a notification on her phone brought her back to reality. When she looked at the screen, she saw a message from her best friend back from their hometown Tsukinose, Saki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did you do today~? I had too much free time, so I just watched the scenery of trains around the world~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, we&#8217;re in the third year, you know? Let&#8217;s study for the exam.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s strange~, I went to my desk to study and that&#8217;s what happened~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been shopping all day today too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see~, what did you buy~?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s not like I bought anything, or rather, I picked them out&#8230;. Oh yeah, do you remember Haru-chan who used to be with Onii?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, yeah&#8230; I think he&#8217;s the one who upgraded from a monkey to a gorilla, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, yes. I went to look at some clothes for Haru-chan&#8230; Wait a minute.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko then chose a few of the images she had taken today that she particularly liked and attached them to her message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some are standard casual, some are feminine with a bit of a sissy look, and some are sweet and girly with a girlish appeal that would be well received by the opposite sex― all of them suits Haruki and Himeko and brings out their charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko thought they looked pretty good, and she also wanted to surprise Saki by showing her reunited childhood friend&#8217;s transformed beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a bit of a surprise, just to give her something to talk about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why it was completely unexpected that she received a call almost as soon as the image was sent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Erm, Saki-chan―&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder who this woman is~?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm!? Saki-chan!? That person&#8217;s Haru-chan, you know!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see~&#8230;. She&#8217;s quite a beautiful girl, isn&#8217;t she~?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yeah, she&#8217;s quite a beauty, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a chilling voice that Himeko could not have imagined from the somewhat timid and laid-back girl she knew. It had a strange power to it― she knew instinctively that she shouldn&#8217;t go against her, so she stretched out her back and sat upright on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wonder, did you lie to me Hime-chan~? I heard you said that she was a gorilla though~?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, yes, that&#8217;s correct, too. She&#8217;s still the same person she was when she was a kid, and even when Onii is in front of her, she&#8217;s still a loose guard, a crass, gorilla.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mou~, just like the old days~!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-Saki-chan!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko was completely bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time she had seen the normally mild-mannered Saki looking so distraught, and she had no idea why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could only cringe as she heard tearful voices on the other end of the line saying things like, &#8220;What school does he go to~?&#8221; &#8220;I knew it. I have to go there for summer vacation~.&#8221; and &#8220;High school boys are wild beasts~&#8230;&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oi~ Himeko, it&#8217;s ready!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that call from Hayato was a godsend for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-Sorry Saki-chan, I&#8217;m called for dinner, so I gotta go now!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh~, Hime-chan~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Onii, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; [TLN: I hate my mind…] [EDN: really man.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko apologized from the bottom of her heart, but took advantage of the situation and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t figure out why until the end, and tilted her head.</span></p>
