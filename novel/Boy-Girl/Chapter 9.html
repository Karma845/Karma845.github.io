<h1>Chapter 9 - The Hidden Side of Kimitaka Kagisaka</h1>


<p>“Kagisaka, can I talk to you for a moment?”</p>

<p>One week had passed since I stopped checking Azusa Tomori’s secret account.</p>
<p>After studying in the library after school and on his way home, he was stopped in the hallway by Chifuyu,</p>

<p>“What happened between you and Azusa? Your attitude towards her has changed over the past week?”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“You used to constantly bicker with her, but now, even when Azusa talks to you, you remain silent.”</p>
<p>“It’s better than fighting, isn’t it?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>“That’s not the point! I don’t mind you ignoring me, but please don’t do the same to Azusa.”</p>

<p>Chifuyu is Tomori’s childhood friend.</p>
<p>That’s probably why she’s angry.</p>

<p>As she said, I had changed my behavior towards Tomori in the past week.</p>
<p>Instead of responding with snide remarks and banter, I remained silent.</p>

<p>Tomori also seemed noticeably down by my response.</p>

<p>“If you had a fight, why don’t you make up with her? You must have noticed that something is off with Azusa. She’s not smiling as much as she used to.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I hate to admit it, but I think it’s because she can’t converse with Kagisaka like she used to. Even if it seemed like she was constantly arguing… Azusa must have enjoyed those conversations. Hey, Kagisaka, aren’t you feeling the same?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>Chifuyu peered into my face with a serious gaze.</p>

<p>(Ah, that might be true.)</p>

<p>I realized it when I changed my behavior a week ago.</p>
<p>I was enjoying the banter and back-and-forth with Tomori more than I thought.</p>

<p>We exchange words without reservations, like best friends.</p>
<p>Those moments were undoubtedly an important piece of Kimitaka Kagisaka’s school life.</p>

<p>(That’s also why…)</p>

<p>My heart aches.</p>
<p>An indescribable loneliness and guilt toward Tomori tighten my heart, and Tomori must be feeling even more pain than me.</p>

<p>Although I haven’t checked her secret account since then, right now, at this moment, there might be confusion, sorrow, or even anger directed toward me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>
<p>Just thinking about it made my heart ache even more.</p>

<p>“Huh? Wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a phone ringtone sounded.</p>
<p>Chifuyu took out her phone from her uniform pocket and answered it.</p>

<p>“Hello? Sorry, but I’m currently busy.”</p>

<p>However, she seemed taken aback by something and said,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>“Huh!?… Is that true?”</p>

<p>Her expression changed.</p>
<p>She remained silent and listened to the person on the other end of the call.</p>
<p>Afterward, she hung up with a tense and stiff expression as if to hide her sudden impatience.</p>

<p>“Sorry. We’ll talk another time. Something urgent came up.”</p>

<p>She quickly left.</p>
<p>Her appearance seemed flustered.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>Perhaps something had happened, and she went to consult with Tomori.</p>

<p>(——No more.)</p>

<p>There’s no need to dwell on such thoughts.</p>
<p>If she sought Tomori’s advice, there’s nothing I should do for her.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I started walking towards my home.</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>However, an unexpected situation arose a few hours after parting ways with Chifuyu.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>【Please, Senpai. Can we talk on a call? It’s urgent.】</p>

<p>It was already past 8 p.m.</p>
<p>While studying at my apartment, I received a DM from Chifuyu using informal language.</p>
<p>The image of her anxious expression from our parting crossed my mind.</p>

<p>【…okay.】</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment, but I agreed.</p>

<p>(I have a bad feeling about this.)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>A similar situation occurred during my delinquent days.</p>
<p>Someone who usually speaks to me politely is now so flustered that they forget to use honorific language.</p>
<p>Usually, in times like these…</p>

<p>“Senpai! Please, help me, Senpai!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my premonition was correct.</p>
<p>What reached my ears was a tearful plea.</p>
<p>Chifuyu was clearly panicking right now.</p>

<p>“Calm down. First, take a deep breath.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>I tried to console her, changing the tone of my voice, but…</p>

<p>“I can’t find my childhood friend… Azusa!”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s words steal away my composure.</p>

<p>“Today after school, Azusa was approached for advice by a girl named Takakura!”</p>

<p>Most likely, that advice was a continuation of what I overheard at the café last time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>“Takakura wanted to break up with her university boyfriend. But apparently, she couldn’t break up with him because he had many delinquent friends who threatened her… When she talked to Azusa about it——”</p>
<p>“Could it be that Azusa went to help her break up with the boyfriend on her behalf?”</p>
<p>“Why, how did you know?”</p>
<p>“I just thought that if it was your childhood friend, she would likely do something like that.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, you’re right. After all, Takakura confessed to that university student after she got relationship advice from Azusa. So Azusa also felt responsible and went to have the breakup conversation on her behalf.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you reach her?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>“No. Even when I send messages on LINE, they remain unread…!”</p>
<p>“Why nobody tried to stop her? Going alone was dangerous—”</p>
<p>“According to Takakura and the others, they tried to stop her together! They said, ‘Let’s go together!’ But Azusa insisted on going alone and got into an argument with everyone in the class!”</p>
<p>“An argument…”</p>

<p>It’s rare for [Everyone’s friend.] to argue with anyone.</p>
<p>That Azusa Tomori was arguing with her classmates?</p>

<p>[However, it might be difficult to delegate work. Azusa has many friends, but she’s not good at opening up to others.], Chifuyu used to worry about this before.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>Tomori probably didn’t want to put her friends in danger.</p>
<p>[Being called [Everyone’s friend] and always solving problems alone like a hero of justice might be the reason why she’s not accustomed to relying on others. She can’t establish deep connections because of that.]</p>
<p>That’s why it ended up in an argument.</p>

<p>——What are you doing, you honor student? Don’t carry it all on your own. When things get tough, rely on someone.</p>

<p>Huh, it’s not my place to say this because it’s the same for me.</p>
<p>I also deliberately kept others at a distance because I didn’t want to hurt anyone anymore.</p>

<p>Tomori’s behavior was not something I couldn’t relate to.</p>

<p>“I… I don’t know what to do, so I ended up relying on you, Senpai… B-Because if something happened to Azusa…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s anxiety seemed to have burst, and she was sobbing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>(Calling the police… is it feasible?)</p>

<p>We don’t have clear evidence of a kidnapping, and the situation is still ambiguous.</p>
<p>Besides, Aisu Academy is one of the top schools in the country.</p>
<p>If it becomes a police matter and the school finds out, there is a possibility that Tomori will be penalized in some way.</p>
<p>It is a fact that Tomori got involved in some external troubles.</p>

<p>“What do you know about her dating partner?”</p>
<p>“I heard his name is Takashi Yamashiro! Do you know him?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I see… What should we do? It might cause various problems, but maybe we should contact the police—”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I’ll take care of it.”</p>

<p>There’s no other choice.</p>
<p>Of course, Kimitaka Kagisaka alone can’t resolve the situation.</p>

<p>However, it’s a different story if it’s Kei, the former leader of Kazarina.</p>
<p>I’ll try to rely on the connections from our days in the streets.</p>

<p>“But, Senpai, you left Kazarina ever since—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, it’s been a while since we last contacted each other, but I believe everyone will lend their help.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you so much. How can I express my gratitude…?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. More importantly, don’t try to search for her alone just because you’re anxious. If you do go, make sure to go with at least five people.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah! Got it! I’ll share the information with everyone in our class through LINE!”</p>

<p>With that, the call ended.</p>
<p>Immediately, I dialed another number.</p>

<p>Nervousness smoldered within my chest.</p>
<p>As I had told Chifuyu earlier, I had never contacted this person before. Yes, ever since that incident…</p>

<p>“—Hiroto-san? It’s been a while. Actually, there’s something I want you to look into—”</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>20 minutes later, I had a general understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>Takashi Yamashiro’s background.</p>
<p>He’s a 21-year-old university student attending a university in Tokyo from a middle-sized company executive’s second son.</p>
<p>His facial features are good-looking, but he has a reckless spending habit and seems to enjoy a flashy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Yamashiro’s name was well-known in delinquent circles.</p>

<p>However, it was a bad name that one should stay away from.</p>
<p>The problem is that recently Yamashiro borrowed money from even more disreputable individuals, and in order to repay it, he used his good looks to extort money from younger women.</p>

<p>(Is that why Aisu students are being targeted?)</p>

<p>Our academy has many sheltered young ladies.</p>
<p>Takakura is likely one of them.</p>
<p>From what I gathered, it was clear that Yamashiro had been involved with multiple women and was gathering unsuspecting targets.</p>

<p>However, even with this information——</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hiroto-san. You’ve done enough in such a short time.”</p>

<p>I still couldn’t determine Yamashiro’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Nor could I locate Azusa Tomori.</p>

<p>“Please continue searching. Give it your all. Feel free to use my name. Oh, and if you find anything, let me know.”</p>

<p>After ending the call, I took a deep breath.</p>

<p>(Let’s calm down.)</p>

<p>Kazarina has an extensive network of information in the delinquent world.</p>
<p>So if I just wait in my room, I should receive a call soon.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that there was no problem, the unease didn’t disappear.</p>

<p>[Sorry, Kei.]</p>

<p>What comes to mind are the words of my former partner.</p>
<p>The hospital room was tinted orange by the evening sun.</p>
<p>A body that was covered in pure white bandages.</p>
<p>The apologetic smile of my partner lying on the bed.</p>

<p>[I can’t be with you anymore…]</p>

<p>It was supposed to be just another same old trouble.</p>
<p>Thanks to my partner and me, the number of consultations we received from our peers at Kazarina had increased.</p>
<p>We were glad to be relied upon, and we devoted ourselves to helping others with all our might.</p>

<p>(Because that was our ideal.)</p>

<p>However, as a result, we got involved in a certain incident.</p>
<p>It was a big brawl in the downtown area at night, which was featured on TV and resulted in some arrests.</p>
<p>During the brawl, my partner sustained severe injuries.</p>

<p>His life wasn’t in danger, and he eventually recovered completely.</p>
<p>In everyday life, there was no problem.</p>
<p>However, he could no longer be involved in rough activities anymore.</p>

<p>Since then, Kimitaka Kagisaka left the team.</p>

<p>I realized that my confidence was nothing more than arrogance.</p>
<p>Although there had been incidents where our comrades were injured while solving cases, none of them had suffered as severely as my partner.</p>

<p>(I never even considered that helping someone could put someone important to me in danger.)</p>

<p>I cursed my foolish self from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>(In the end, it’s good that I left.)</p>

<p>Kei’s name had become too well-known in the delinquent world.</p>
<p>When I heard that the number of consultations brought to Kazarina significantly decreased after it became known that Leader Kei had left, I honestly felt relieved.</p>
<p>Now, no one would get deeply hurt like my partner did.</p>

<p>If I just don’t have any connections, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>No one will get hurt.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought…</p>

<p>Driven by anger, I pound on the wall of my room.</p>
<p>My left-hand tingled, but it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>——How can I help Azusa Tomori?</p>

<p>I’m not going to let that happen.</p>
<p>I won’t let someone close to me get hurt again.</p>

<p>“Ah——”</p>

<p>As I pondered within myself, my eyes fell on my smartphone.</p>
<p>It must have fallen to the floor from my pocket due to the impact of hitting the wall.</p>

<p>“That’s right…”</p>

<p>The secret account.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori’s SNS that no one else knows about.</p>

<p>Perhaps there could be some clues there.</p>
<p>However, my finger stopped as I was about to trace the secret account from the internet history.</p>

<p>(I decided to just remain as a normal classmate. Is it okay for me to look at her secret account?)</p>
<p>I felt uneasy.</p>
<p>Because for the past week, I have been ignoring that person relentlessly, and the anger towards me might have been written in her secret account.</p>
<p>Or maybe Azusa Tomori no longer likes Kimitaka Kagisaka, and moreover, she might even hate him to the extent of not wanting to speak to him ever again.</p>

<p>No, on the other hand, I don’t think that’s possible, but…</p>

<p>” ——— “</p>

<p>I was anxious, but I was determined.</p>
<p>With the single-minded desire to know Tomori’s whereabouts, I accessed the secret account.</p>

<p>I scrolled through the tweets from a few days ago in search of any clues. And there, what was written———.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>《K-kun was cold again today…》</p>

<p>Seeing such a tweet from a few days ago, a knife was thrust into my heart.</p>
<p>Ah, as I thought.</p>
<p>Tomori hates me——.</p>

<p>《Ehehe~ Well, I can understand K-kun’s feelings though~》</p>

<p>“——— ???”</p>

<p>《From the day after we met at the café, you’ve been ignoring me non-stop, K-kun.》</p>
<p>《You’re really adorable, you know.》</p>
<p>《I can’t believe you deliberately ignore me just because it’s embarrassing to meet my eyes.》</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>《Uuu, I’m in the same boat, though! It’s so tough to endure every day!》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>《When I recall the moment we held hands, my face can’t help but break into a smile!》</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>《No, this won’t do! Calm down, me!》</p>
<p>《If I keep smiling to myself, people will think I’m weird.》</p>
<p>《Let’s try not to smile too much in the classroom.》</p>

<p>“Ah, by the way…”</p>

<p>Chifuyu also mentioned it.</p>
<p>Lately, Tomori’s smiles have decreased.</p>
<p>I thought she was hurt by being ignored by me, but…</p>

<p>《C-chan asked me if I was feeling down, but I brushed it off, saying, ‘No, everything’s fine.’》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>《I’m okay! I’m more energetic than ever! And the distance between me and K-kun is closing… Tomohō——》</p>
<p>《tomochan great victoryiiiiiiiiii !!! But I wonder if it’s okay? If I’m this excited, K-kun might notice my feelings——》</p>

<p>“There’s no way I’d notice that!”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but shout.</p>

<p>She’s too pure!</p>
<p>Did she think that avoiding me was a positive thing?</p>
<p>She doesn’t realize at all that instead of getting closer, the distance between us has only grown!</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking this for a while, but she’s just way too into me.</p>
<p>Ah, seriously…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“Don’t make the pattern that I thought would never happen come true.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but laugh, then leaned my back against the wall and slouched down.</p>
<p>——Though, I’m relieved.</p>

<p>Tomori doesn’t hate me.</p>
<p>Knowing that fact made me inexplicably happy, but I can’t relax now.</p>
<p>I continue to read her tweet, searching for clues about Tomori’s whereabouts.</p>

<p>《K-kun, I still love you.》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>However, all I see are tweets like that.</p>

<p>《I really love the kind you. I love the hardworking you. I love how you treat me as an equal like we’re best friends.》</p>

<p>——Even though I rejected her regardless of the number of times she tried to get close.</p>
<p>Tomori loves me this much.</p>

<p>《I want to tell K-kun right now that I love him. I want us to become lovers… Ah, come to think of it, that was the reason I started the secret account. I have to vent here by saying I love you a lot——》</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>《I can’t stop myself from telling K-kun how much I love him!!!》</p>

<p>What’s that?</p>
<p>Did you create the secret account for such a reason?</p>
<p>How much of a love fool are you, Class President?</p>

<p>“No, the fool is me.”</p>

<p>I was the one who acted coldly towards Tomori, yet I was afraid of being disliked by her.</p>
<p>And now, knowing that she still loves me, I feel an immense sense of relief.</p>
<p>At this point, the conclusion has already been reached in my mind.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>

<p>” ———— “</p>

<p>That’s why I started running.</p>
<p>I dashed out of the apartment in my school uniform, heading towards Shin-Himegaoka Station.</p>
<p>The destination is a tweet from Tomori just three hours ago.</p>

<p>《That’s strange. Wasn’t the karaoke place near the station under renovation?》</p>

<p>That’s likely Tomori’s location.</p>
<p>A karaoke place under renovation. It’s a perfect place for undesirable people to gather.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>

<p>I can mobilize members of the Kazarina group, but considering the distance, it would be faster to go directly.</p>
<p>Though if I get involved in any trouble, my true identity might be exposed to Tomori…</p>

<p>(It doesn’t matter.)</p>

<p>Right now, helping Tomori is more important than anything else.</p>
<p>Yes, the decision has already been made.</p>

<p>I finally realized it.</p>
<p>Just like Tomori was trying to suppress her own feelings, I was desperately trying to suppress mine.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>
<p>Azusa Tomori is not just a classmate.</p>
<p>She is someone important to Kimitaka Kagisaka——!</p>

<p>*****</p>
<p>“I’ll do it for 500,000 yen.”</p>

<p>A 10-story building near Shin-Himegaoka Station.</p>
<p>On the 7th floor, in the large room of the karaoke place under renovation.</p>
<p>In that room, lit by multiple lights, a tall man wearing a white jacket—Takashi Yamashiro—said to me.</p>

<p>“If you agree to that, I’ll break up with her quickly.”</p>
<p>“…There’s no way I can afford that kind of money.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>
<p>“What? Don’t lie. Aisu is a super prestigious school, right? If you’re a student there, you can easily get 500,000 yen from your parents.”</p>

<p>Yamashiro distorts his well-defined features and laughs, and his entourage joins in with their raucous laughter.</p>

<p>(…I made a completely wrong judgment.)</p>

<p>I was called here three hours ago to solve Takakura-san’s problem.</p>
<p>The discussion was that only Yamashiro would come to the meeting place, but…</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange to bring people to accompany you simply for a breakup conversation?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>“What’s wrong with bringing friends? I want to introduce my cute girlfriend. Besides, Takakura is also the one who broke the promise by bringing someone else for a breakup.”</p>
<p>“That’s…”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s fine since the one she brought is twice as cute as her.”</p>

<p>I felt a shiver as they looked at me as if appraising my value.</p>
<p>I want to escape from here immediately, but one of the entourage members is blocking the exit.</p>
<p>My smartphone was also taken away as soon as I entered the room.</p>

<p>Of course, I resisted, but they threatened me by saying they’ll expose hidden pictures of Takakura on social media if I resisted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>I had no choice but to comply with their demands. There’s no real evidence that they took any hidden pictures, of course.</p>

<p>But if the photos turn out to be inappropriate——</p>

<p>“You better pay quickly.”</p>

<p>One of Yamashiro’s entourage members urged me impatiently.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Did you know Hiroto-san?”</p>
<p>“..Hiroto-san?”</p>
<p>“What?! You don’t know Hiroto-san!?… He’s one of the founding members of Kazarina and the current leader! He’s the one who took charge of Kazalina after the legendary Kei and his partner disappeared——Hiroto-san is way scarier than me. So it’s better to settle things before he arrives, okay?”</p>

<p>For now, it is clear that they are a fox borrowing the might of a tiger.</p>

<p>(——This is my chance.)</p>

<p>The discussion has been at a deadlock for three hours.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>Bringing up this topic all of a sudden should be their breaking point as well.</p>

<p>“Hey! Don’t stay quiet!”</p>

<p>He’s here.</p>
<p>Seemingly fed up, one of the entourage members blocking the exit grabbed my collar and forcibly lifted me up from the sofa—that was the moment.</p>

<p>“Huh!”</p>

<p>I grabbed the right wrist of the person who had roughly grabbed my collar with both hands.</p>
<p>With my weight, I swiftly twisted their arm.</p>
<p>It’s one of the self-defense techniques I learned from a friend who practices Aikido, and it works effectively.</p>
<p>(TN: Aikido Front Choke Defense)</p>

<p>I slammed the man’s body onto the floor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>
<p>I twisted his right arm in a joint lock, restraining him face-down.</p>

<p>“You, you bastard!”</p>

<p>As the groaning entourage member writhed in pain, I stepped on his back and made a dash for the exit.</p>
<p>I have to get out of here for now.</p>

<p>“Ah, a pity!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a surge of electricity ran through my body.</p>
<p>It’s not a metaphor.</p>
<p>My vision flickered with electric sparks, and my thoughts short-circuited.</p>
<p>An electric shock ran through my entire body, causing both of my knees to give out.</p>

<p>“Ah——”</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>By the time I realized it, my body had collapsed onto the floor.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“Whoa, that’s amazing! What was that, Takashi?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, it’s a self-defense taser gun that I added to my collection recently.”</p>
<p>“A gun?”</p>
<p>“In layman’s terms, it’s a long-range stun gun. You shoot electrodes at the target and deliver an electric shock through the connected wires. It’s used by police in America and stuff.”</p>
<p>“Where did you buy something like that?”</p>
<p>“On an illegal overseas website! I’ll lend you one later—”</p>
<p>“We’re not in a situation to talk about that!”</p>

<p>The man I had restrained earlier became furious.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>
<p>With an enraged expression, he stood up and delivered a powerful kick to my side.</p>
<p>Pain and agony made it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>I could sense my consciousness fading rapidly into emptiness.</p>

<p>“…Tsk, idiot, you went too far.”</p>
<p>“But this woman…!”</p>
<p>“For now, stop it. After we’re done filming, you can do whatever you want.”</p>

<p>Filming.</p>
<p>That word filled me with a sense of dread.</p>
<p>I try to resist, but my limbs are powerless.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>

<p>“Well, let’s get started.”</p>

<p>I’m roughly laid down on the table with the support of the men.</p>

<p>“I should have done this from the beginning. The story about secretly filming Takakura was a lie, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, did you find out? Well, we got a better blackmail threat material now, so it’s okay.”</p>

<p>At this point, I understand what they intend to do to me.</p>
<p>They want to use me as an ATM.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>That’s why they want to create the necessary intimidation to squeeze me.</p>

<p>“Sto…p…”</p>

<p>I desperately resist with an incoherent tongue.</p>
<p>I felt like tears were about to stream down my face from frustration and fear.</p>

<p>(——Ah)</p>

<p>How did it come to this?</p>
<p>Even though I was so happy during this past week…</p>

<p>K-kun… I was able to get closer to Kagisaka-kun…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>I was overjoyed that I finally became friends with him.</p>
<p>I felt like I could do anything on my own.</p>

<p>But somehow, I ended up arguing with everyone in the class.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to put everyone in danger, so I ran out of the classroom alone.</p>

<p>(Even though I tried to show Kagisaka-kun at the coffee shop how good it is to connect with others…)</p>

<p>Ironically, I myself ended up abandoning my connections with everyone.</p>

<p>“Huh? Who is it at a time like this, Yamashiro?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>And then, a phone ring echoed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It’s an unknown number… Ah, hello? I’m in the middle of something… Hi, Hiroto-san!?”</p>

<p>Yamashiro answered in a frightened voice as if he were a completely different person.</p>

<p>“W-why do you know this number… and, huh? You had your people looking into us…? Are you looking for us?”</p>

<p>Yamashiro’s words confused his followers.</p>
<p>In a flustered state, Yamashiro hung up the phone and shouted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>“Oh shit, Kazarina is looking for us!”</p>
<p>“M-maybe it’s not a big deal? You’re acquainted with Hiroto-san…”</p>
<p>“No, actually, we only happened to be together once at a large gathering, and we never spoke to each other… Anyway, let’s escape! If we get caught, who knows what will happen to us…!”</p>

<p>Ah, thank goodness.</p>
<p>From the conversation I overheard, it seems like Yamashiro and the others are planning to escape thanks to this person named Hiroto——</p>

<p>“——Wait a minute. Before we escape, should we have some fun with this girl?”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>

<p>However, the moment of relief was only temporary.</p>
<p>One of Yamashiro’s followers, who had kicked me earlier, spoke in a voice filled with anger.</p>

<p>“It won’t settle if we just let her go! Besides, if we run away from Kazarina, we’ll need even more money, won’t we?”</p>
<p>“T-that’s true. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“——That might be okay. Even if it’s Kazarina, they won’t easily find this place. Let’s do it before they come. And if it’s because of this woman that we’re in this mess… Then…”</p>

<p>Yamashiro straddled me dominatingly, saying he would mess me up like crazy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>
<p>My blouse was roughly undone, and buttons came off, exposing my skin and underwear.</p>
<p>I tried to resist, but my body refused to move.</p>

<p>(Please, someone help me…)</p>

<p>My entire body trembled with despair and fear.</p>
<p>No matter how much I wished for help, I knew no one would come.</p>
<p>All I could do was pray.</p>

<p>And slowly.</p>
<p>Yamashiro’s hand reached toward my chest!!</p>

<p>“——Hey, enough.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span>

<p>Suddenly, a chilling cold voice resounded.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“——Hey, enough.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a chilling cold voice resounded.</p>
<p>Due to the electric shock, my vision was unfocused.</p>
<p>There, reflected in it, was a boy wearing a gray uniform who entered by forcefully opening the door.</p>
<p>What?</p>

<p>“…K-kagisaka-kun?”</p>

<p>No way. Why are you here?</p>
<p>No, run away. There’s no way you can win in a three-on-one fight. And besides, Yamashiro even has a stun gun.</p>

<p>“Get away from that kid right now.”</p>

<p>Who the hell are you? One of his cronies shouted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span>
<p>The guy rushed towards him and threw a punch——</p>
<p>As it turns out, it didn’t take more than a few seconds for him to settle things.</p>
<p>With a dry sound, the boy’s body collapsed to the floor.</p>

<p>It was a sharp counter strike with his palm heel. Precisely hitting the chin with the palm, shaking the opponent’s brain.</p>
<p>As a result, the guy fell down and lost consciousness with a concussion.</p>

<p>“Bastard!”</p>

<p>There was even less mercy against the next guy.</p>
<p>His left fist sank into the face of the crony who was about to attack.</p>
<p>The startled man tried to avoid it by bowing down his head and trying to tackle Kagisaka-kun’s leg.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span>

<p>“Agh!”</p>

<p>With a scream, the guy clung to his body.</p>
<p>Kagisaka-kun slammed the man’s left ear and controlled his movement.</p>
<p>Moaning in pain as if his ear was about to tear off, the man tried to grab Kagisaka-kun’s arm.</p>
<p>Then a powerful knee strike was delivered to his face.</p>

<p>It was a blow that perfectly anticipated the opponent’s movement.</p>
<p>The man finally fell to the ground and twitched like a doll.</p>

<p>“W-Wait!”</p>

<p>A frantic scream.</p>
<p>After Yamashiro got off me, he dropped the taser gun to the floor and raised his hands in surrender.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span>

<p>“I’ll give her back, so please save me!”</p>

<p>He pleaded for his life with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>It was understandable. Yamashiro was the only one left.</p>
<p>In just a few seconds, Kagisaka-kun had taken down his cronies.</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“R-Really!?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sure. I won’t do anything else. Just apologize to Tomori first.”</p>

<div><img src="https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T17.png" alt="" /></div><p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<p>“Okay…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span>

<p>Yamashiro took a deep breath, trying to calm his ragged breathing, and then pulled out another taser gun from inside his jacket,</p>

<p>“You idiot!”</p>

<p>I was astonished by the sight in front of me.</p>
<p>It was a bluff, making it seem like he surrendered.</p>

<p>Earlier, Yamashiro had said, [I’ll lend you one later.]</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span>
<p>From the beginning, he had a second gun, including the one he would lend to his cronies.</p>

<p>But what surprised me wasn’t that fact.</p>
<p>It was as if he had predicted Yamashiro’s movements.</p>
<p>As soon as the weapon was revealed, Kagisaka-kun closed the distance in an instant.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Kagisaka-kun struck Yamashiro’s hand with a knife-hand strike.</p>
<p>The impact caused the gun to fall to the floor.</p>

<p>Immediately after kicking Yamashiro away with a front kick and creating some distance, the battle was over.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span>
<p>Kagisaka-kun picked up the taser gun that had fallen to the ground and held it with one hand.</p>

<p>“You…!”</p>

<p>Yamashiro, unable to move due to the gun pointed at him, shouted.</p>

<p>“You tried to deceive me? Saying earlier that you won’t do anything…!”</p>
<p>“You were trying to deceive me too, okay?”</p>
<p>“Damn it! How did you know I had another one?”</p>
<p>“Your jacket’s chest area was slightly bulging. If you pay attention and observe, you can tell when someone is up to something. Deceiving with a fake surrender is basic. And…”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span>
<p>“A-And?”</p>

<p>Yamashiro asked with a frightened expression, and Kagisaka-kun, with a cold expression, said,</p>

<p>“I won’t believe the words of a bastard like you.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>“Aghh!”</p>

<p>Yamashiro convulsed as he received a high-voltage electric shock and collapsed to the floor.</p>

<p>(A-amazing…!)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span>

<p>I was amazed at the vividness of the situation.</p>
<p>It was a horrific attack, but it wasn’t meant to torment the opponent.</p>
<p>He did it because it was the most effective thing to do.</p>

<p>Rendering the opponent unable to act using the shortest route to protect myself!</p>
<p>A sharp counter, the ear, and kneeing. It was completely different from the conventional techniques I had learned.</p>

<p>The speed and precision were like a refined procedure.</p>
<p>It’s the behavior of someone highly experienced in actual combat.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span>

<p>Moreover, it wasn’t just mindless violence.</p>
<p>In the end, he saw through the bluff and turned the tables, completely overwhelming them with strategy.</p>

<p>“It’s okay now, Tomori.”</p>

<p>Kagisaka-kun said in a gentle voice that seemed completely different from before, reassuring me.</p>

<p>“Go rest now. You took a hit, huh? Your focus is off.”</p>
<p>“Ah… “</p>

<p>I nodded dizzily</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span>
<p>Suddenly, my thread of tension snapped.</p>
<p>The consciousness I had barely held on to started fading.</p>

<p>“S-sorry, I’m sorry, p-please forgive me…”</p>

<p>A pitch-black field of vision. Amidst that, I could hear Yamashiro’s screams in my fading consciousness.</p>

<p>“Takashi Yamashiro.”</p>

<p>And then, Kagisaka-kun’s voice once again filled with coldness.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you guys to the ones who will be here soon. Don’t get close to Aisu students from now on. And never lay a hand on Tomori again.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span>

<p>In the darkness…</p>
<p>On the verge of breaking my consciousness, suddenly——</p>

<p>“Don’t touch my friend.”</p>

<p>——Those were the words I had been longing for all this time.</p>
