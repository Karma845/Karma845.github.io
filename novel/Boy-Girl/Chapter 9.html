<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Oi?!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, both I and Haruki went back to class together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a good time. The school entrance was a bit far, so we rushed the gate as fast as we could, shoulder-to-shoulder, just like in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, I felt Haruki’s gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm, what is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nothing in particular, it’s not like I don’t want to look up at you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you a child?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pfft]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki turned her face away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was amazed at her words and actions that seemed to be so Haruki-like. I sighed and laughed after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a childhood friend who has never changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A friend who shared memories with the same past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the moment we stepped into the classroom, I turned into a dull transfer student while she turned into an honor student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, it’s Nikaido-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Okay, let’s ask Nikaido here. It’s an English assignment, what’s the translation for this&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, sorry. Can you tell me this one, too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Me too!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm, are you guys asking me? Sure, I can help]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no time, Haruki was surrounded by both boys and girls. The population density of the seat next to me is overcrowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, they had something to ask Haruki about a problem they had yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, I wonder if her results are excellent]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered what I heard yesterday. I’m not sure how many of them are here just to talk to her compared to the people that actually need help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’m sure Haruki’s aware of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the way she replied with a small voice and in a friendly manner made me understand why she’s so popular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I’m not a big fan of crowds, I decided to take refuge near the window and observe my childhood friend from a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I wonder if this is her ‘facade’)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered what I had said yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, I was fooled by her facade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to do anything about it though, since I’ve found out the truth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, Haruki is Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be a reason for her facade, but I don’t want to force her to tell me. I had a sense of trust that she’d tell me at the correct TPO. (T/N: TPO = Time, Place, and Occasion)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I just smile bitterly at Haruki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nikaido is popular as always, isn’t she? That’s always the case, you know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s always the same, I’m sure she’s a beautiful girl… Uhm&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mori, Iori Mori. Nice to meet you, transfer stude- I mean, Kirishima]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Nice to meet you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who spoke to me was a male student with dyed hair. He was one of those who actively asked me questions yesterday</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a grinning face, he takes a position next to me and turns his gaze towards Haruki</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it’s a high threshold to jump into the circle right after your transfer. Also, I’m not interested in those kind of things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you sure you don’t wanna join them?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s a bit impossible, she’s like a Flower of Takamine. So you need high standards to ask her out] (T/N: Flower of Takamine means High Stakes)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know a lot of guys who tried to ask her out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eeh&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I looked around the classroom, I could see people talking with friends, copying assignments, and opening their bags and immersing themselves in the world of books. I can see all kinds of people here. It seems that not everybody is interested in Haruki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, Haruki is a special person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people thought that because she’s special, the world she lives in is far away from theirs. I myself used to think so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, do your best, Kirishima]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh? Do my best on what?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh well, we both know what I’m talking about]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No no no, wait. You’re misunderstanding me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mori made fun of me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s undeniable that I had some mysterious feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I, who felt cornered, desperately protested to Mori-san due to my embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been separated for 7 years, so there might be many things we don’t know about each other. But one thing for sure, we’re not children like we were back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As expected, I shouldn’t get involved with her too much at school)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a good figure and good grades, Haruki Nikaido is surely a popular girl among the high ranks. She is the idol of the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did say that she’s using a ‘facade’. In other words, there must be a reason why she decided to do it. I’m not sure what to do for now, but I’m sure I’ll be able to do something when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haa&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kirishima?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm? It’s nothing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You sure?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a bit lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I exhaled and decided to watch Haruki from afar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, lunch came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, I was looking at Haruki who was surrounded by my classmates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;At school, the world you live in is different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, I didn’t really understand his (Mori-san) words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kirishima-kun, can you come with me please?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… Nikaido-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Haruki didn’t think that we lived in a different world</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face is a s quiet as before. But her eyes are somehow stern and serious, radiating an aura that can’t be ignored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, my classmates started to mumble about it.</span></p>
