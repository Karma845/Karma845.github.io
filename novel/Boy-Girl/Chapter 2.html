<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Grumpy Girlfriend</h3>

<p>It seems that my answer earlier wasn&#8217;t good enough</p><p>I felt an aura of dissatisfaction from the beautiful girl sitting next to me</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was a misunderstanding, but if she tried to look away every time we made eye contact, it seemed unlikely</p>
<p>(Uh, I wonder what&#8217;s wrong...)</p>
<p>Shortly after that, the class began regardless of my feeling</p><p>As I thought, the lessons were different from my old school.</p><p>I listened desperately to keep up. However, there were times when I don&#8217;t understand at all</p>

<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, what&#8217;s the printout from the other day?]</p>
<p>[....]</p>
<p>There are times when I have to rely on her to help me with teaching materials and such. Even if I don&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;m grateful for her help</p>



<p>[Uh, let&#8217;s see...]</p><p>[Here it is. Also, your desk is too far, why don&#8217;t you move your desk closer?]</p><p>[Ah, thanks]</p><p>[No problem]</p>
<p>Fortunately, she&#8217;s willing to show me her printout. So it seems that she doesn&#8217;t completely hate me</p>
<p>It seems that I didn&#8217;t understand her well</p>
<p>(Ugh, if only she&#8217;s like my younger sister Himeko who&#8217;d be in a better mood if I gave her something sweet to her)</p>
<p>In the countryside, the only person of the same age, or even the opposite sex, was my younger sister</p><p>&#12288;But I guess I shouldn&#8217;t compare her to my younger sister&#12288;</p>

<p>Then I thought it would be quicker to ask her directly, so I tried to talk to her after class is over</p>
<p>[Well, Nikaido-san...]</p><p>[Hey, Kirishima, about this morning&#8217;s question...]</p><p>[Ah, I just wanted to ask you if there&#8217;s something on your mind]</p>
<p>[Over there-]</p>
<p>My question was interrupted by a my classmates</p><p>I was considered a good prey for those who have begun to get used to school and feel bored with the same old routine</p>

<p>[Haa...]</p><p>When Nikaido-san saw me being tussled by my classmates, she let out a somewhat annoyed sigh</p>


p><p>&#9671;&#9671;&#9671;</p>

<p>The barrage of questions was repeated at every break, and eventually lunchtime came without a chance to talk to her</p>
<p>As expected, my classmates prioritize eating rather than asking me questions. I could see groups of people eating their lunch everywhere in the school. I thought it was a good chance to talk to Nikaido-san</p>
<p>(I have to talk to her somehow)</p>
<p>It may not be something to worry about. But there was something stuck in my mind</p>
<p>Since Nikaido-san is a pretty girl, I also wanted to get closer to her as a healthy boy</p><p>[Nikaido-san, do you-]</p><p>[Excuse me, is Nikaido-san here?!]</p>
<p>[Ah, yes. I&#8217;m here]</p>

<p>Once again, I missed my chance to speak to her</p><p>This time, she was called by a girl who&#8217;s smaller than her</p><p>After that, my words and hands flew through the air in vain</p>

<p>Some of my male classmates approached me while grinning and tapped my shoulder as they found out what I was trying to do</p>


<p>[Haha, getting your eyes on Nikaido-san right on your first day, transfer student? Don&#8217;t worry, I understand how you feel]</p>
<p>[Yep, she&#8217;s good looking, good-natured, and also good at her studies. She&#8217;s also very popular in the sports club]</p>
<p>[Just now, are they talking about student-council work?] (TN: He&#8217;s talking about Nikaido-san and the younger girl)</p>
<p>[I thought so, isn&#8217;t she amazing?]</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve heard, she was like a picture of a perfect honor student</p>
<p>Well, Nikaido-san is indeed a beautiful girl</p>


<p>Moreover, if she&#8217;s both skilled in martial arts and literature, and her personality is as gentle and humble as she looks. She must be extremely popular</p>
<p>(Even if it&#8217;s the same Nikaido, she&#8217;s very different from that guy&#8230; Or is it that, I&#8217;ve misunderstood him as a boy since then???)</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but smile when I thought about it</p><p>[You can go for her, but that&#8217;s a long shot]</p><p>[I heard you were quite popular in junior high, but no one ever talked about you. Oh well, didn&#8217;t you get dumped as soon as you entered High School?]</p>
<p>[Shut up! Transfer student, I mean, Kirishima shouldn&#8217;t have strange expectations either]</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s not what I meant&#8230;.]</p>
<p>As expected, she seems to be quite popular</p><p>Even though I was teased by my classmates, it&#8217;s not like I wanted to go out with her or what</p>

<p>I do think she&#8217;s cute, and there&#8217;s no denying that. But my honest impression about her was that I didn&#8217;t really understand her yet</p>
<p>It would be the same for Nikaido-san</p><p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not sure that I wanted to go out with her</p>
<p>Why would such a girl give off a disgruntled air and take curt attitude when we were supposedly meeting for the first time?</p>
<p>(Hm, I don&#8217;t understand)</p>
<p>No matter how much I think, I couldn&#8217;t get an answer</p>
<p>I felt like I really need to talk to her as soon as possible</p>
