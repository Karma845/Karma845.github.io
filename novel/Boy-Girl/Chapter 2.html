<h1>Chapter 2 - The Honor Student and the Troublemaker―Rain and Canned Coffee</h1>


<p>[Chassu, senpai!]</p>

<p>It’s 10:30 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
<p>While I was studying at my desk in my apartment, I received a DM (direct message).</p>

<p>[Have you watched ‘Kimi Hana’ today?]</p>
<p>[Not yet.]</p>
<p>[Huh, watch it quickly! The animation was seriously amazing!]</p>

<p>The person on the other end of the DM is… let’s call her Kouhai-chan (Junior).</p>
<p>From the content of the message, you can tell she’s an otaku.</p>

<p>[The depiction of the heroine’s boobs was strangely intense and hilarious!]</p>

<p>Correction.</p>
<p>She’s an otaku at the extreme end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>[‘Kimi Dake ni Hanataba o’ is a wholesome yuri anime. You are the only one who can burst into laughter at the chest animation.]</p>
<p>[Wow, that’s a very Yuri pig opinion.]</p>
<p>[I’m not a Yuri pig. I just like the portrayal of friendship between the characters.]</p>
<p>[Ah, Senpai, you also like nomakapu too, don’t you?] (Normal coupling)</p>
<p>[Rather, weren’t you not interested in Yuri anime before?]</p>
<p>[Well, that’s true, but…]</p>

<p>After a few seconds, an image of an anime character appeared on the DM screen.</p>
<p>It’s one of the heroines of Kimi Hana, Erika Kokonoe.</p>

<p>[Erika-tan is my favorite girl♡.]</p>
<p>[You still have a thing for red-haired characters, huh?]</p>
<p>[It’s not just about the hair, you know?! Erika-tan may be a delinquent, but she shows a different side as the main heroine… Oh! How about we watch the latest episode together now?! I want to rewatch it too!]</p>
<p>[Well…]</p>
<p>[Oh, wait. Were you studying or something?]</p>
<p>[Nope. I was just about to watch it.]</p>

<p>I ended up telling a little lie.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I wanted to focus on studying, but this was an invitation from my best friend. I decided to prioritize our friendship.</p>
<p>Though I couldn’t let Kouhai-chan come over to my place, we could still watch it together using a streaming site.</p>

<p>[…Sorry for disturbing your study.]</p>
<p>[You found out?]</p>
<p>[I could tell. I know your personality, Senpai. You’re aware of that, right?]</p>
<p>[Well, it’s true I did want to watch ‘Kimi Hana.’ This episode is probably a slice-of-life one, right? Logically thinking, next week should be a serious episode.]</p>
<p>[Huh? How did you know that?]</p>
<p>[Psychologically, people feel more affected by unhappiness when it follows after happiness. Showing daily life and making viewers feel happy first and then hitting them with a serious development can create a greater impact. That’s why I want to fully enjoy the happiness in this episode, and then I’ll prepare myself for the hell that’s coming next week.]</p>
<p>[Let’s not make predictions that are close to spoilers, okay?]</p>

<p>‘This is why people with quick minds are so~ !’ says the Kouhai-chan.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.</p>
<p>I thought my attempt to change the atmosphere through conversation might work since she seemed apologetic based on her, and it seems it worked out well.</p>

<p>[Oh, wait a moment. Since we’re at it, I’ll prepare some cola and snacks.]</p>
<p>[Ehh, I’m jealous!]</p>
<p>[Here you go.]</p>
<p>[Wow, stop with the food temptation!]</p>

<p>I sent a picture of cola and ice cream, and Kouhai-chan let out a scream.</p>

<p>[Moreover, it’s Häagen-Dazs! I envy you. My parents are strict, and eating snacks late at night is a no-no.]</p>
<p>[It’s one of the perks of living alone.]</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean my parents weren’t strict.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they were too strict.</p>
<p>I haven’t told Kouhai-chan, but the Kagisaka family, where I was born, is a prominent family and is well-known in certain circles.</p>

<p>【Listen, Kimitaka. Once you’re born into the Kagisaka family, your future is already determined.】</p>

<p>Those words of my strict father resurface in my mind.</p>
<p>Growing up as the second son of the main Kagisaka family, I was pushed into various lessons from an early age.</p>
<p>I was educated to put on a friendly facade for relatives and my parents’ entourage. I was constantly drilled with the philosophy of becoming a cog in a well-respected family.</p>

<p>As a result, using a rather classical expression…</p>

<p>I rebelled.</p>
<p>It’s so easy to understand why.</p>

<p>(Now that I think about it, it was a natural reaction.)</p>

<p>It’s like a devout Christian child growing tired of God’s teachings and becoming a worshipper of death metal as a rock musician.</p>
<p>Thus, Kimitaka Kagisaka has driven away from his parent’s home and began living alone in a small, cheap one-room apartment.</p>

<p>[Senpai, are you ready?]</p>
<p>[Yep. Thanks for waiting.]</p>

<p>My goal is to stand on my own without returning to the Kagisaka main family.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll repay all the living expenses I borrow and dedicate myself to studying every day, hoping to get into a decent university to survive in modern society solely on my own abilities.</p>

<p>However, there’s no need to burden Kouhai-chan with such complicated circumstances.</p>
<p>We’re here to enjoy anime as an otaku friend late at night.</p>
<p>What we need is not some dreary family drama but carbonated drinks and sweets, don’t you think?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>The time was midnight.</p>
<p>After watching the latest episode of “Kimi Hana” and sharing our thoughts, our watch party for tonight came to an end…</p>

<p>“…I can’t accept it.”</p>

<p>Looking at my Twitter timeline, I found that many people had similar opinions to those of Kouhai-chan.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone is focusing more on the animation rather than the story.</p>

<p>Well, it’s not a big deal since “Kimi Hana” is a show with plenty of fan service.</p>

<p>(I recommended it to her, too…)</p>

<p>I recall an incident that happened just two days ago.</p>

<p>[Hey, is anime really that interesting?]</p>

<p>Tomori asked me that while I was watching anime during break time in the classroom.</p>

<p>[Of course. My top recommendation this season is ‘Kimi Hana.’]</p>
<p>[Hmm, well, I definitely won’t watch it.]</p>
<p>[Huh? Then why did you ask?]</p>
<p>[I just wanted to know what kind of things someone watches to grow up to be an introverted guy like Kagisaka-kun.]</p>
<p>[I also want to know. Did I kill your parents or your siblings?]</p>

<p>Well, you wouldn’t understand this kind of enjoyment, I continued and said to her.</p>
<p>I might have provoked her a bit.</p>

<p>“I seem to have provided material for another poisonous remark…”</p>

<p>――I watched your favorite cartoon.</p>
<p>――But you know what?</p>
<p>――Three-dimensional girls’ chests don’t bounce that much, you know?</p>

<p>I felt like I would be scoffed at with such a comment.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>While I was thinking about it, I searched for reviews of “Kimi Hana” and found some opinions I could relate to.</p>

<p>[The character relationships were good! #KimiHana]</p>
<p>[I love how the heroines are like partners! #KimiHana]</p>
<p>[It’s my first time watching, but it’s really interesting! #KimiHana]</p>

<p>Alright, I can’t help but give a big smile.</p>
<p>What, there is a viewer who appreciate the story after all.</p>
<p>Thinking that way made me feel happy. </p>

<p>[However, I don’t think real-life girls’ chests bounce like that. #KimiHana]</p>
<p>“….you sound like a certain class representative.”</p>

<p>No, was that line something Azusa Tomori, in my mind, said?</p>

<p>(Or rather, did this person start watching from the latest episode?)</p>

<p>The account name was ‘tomochan.’</p>
<p>No followers, no followings.</p>
<p>The tweet just before “Kimi Hana” started was:</p>

<p>[I might try watching the anime recommended by K-kun.]</p>

<p>“What, a friend recommended it to you?”</p>

<p>I nodded in agreement, thinking that I might get along with this K-kun guy.</p>
<p>And then, a new tweet appeared.</p>

<p>[I want to talk and share my thoughts with K-kun.]</p>
<p>[But he might think I’m crazy if I suddenly start talking about anime.]</p>
<p>[I’m sure K-kun doesn’t like me.]</p>

<p>“Hmm? “</p>

<p>[In front of him, I can’t be honest and end up being rude.]</p>
<p>[He might think I don’t like him, but…he’s an idiot. I’m just acting that way because others would be jealous otherwise.]</p>
<p>[If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t talk to you so much!]</p>

<p>“…This person is really experiencing youth to the fullest.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but talk to myself as I read the tweets that seemed to be venting her worries.</p>
<p>Seriously, she likes this ‘K-kun.’ too much.</p>
<p>I’m a little jealous.</p>

<p>“All right. Hang in there, tomochan.”</p>

<p>If you speak honestly, I’m sure K-kun will also turn around and pay attention to you.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but cheer her on because she liked “Kimi Hana”.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a love story of a stranger on SNS.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll forget all about it tomorrow.</p>


<p>***</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun, I watched the anime you recommended the other day as a way to kill time.”</p>

<p>But…</p>
<p>The next day, I had a conversation I’ll never forget.</p>

<p>“There’s no fault in the anime, so I’ll just say it… The relationships between the characters are pretty good.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“The heroines felt like partners to each other.”</p>
<p>” ……… “</p>
<p>“It was my first time watching, but it was alright, I guess…”</p>
<p>” ……… “</p>
<p>“I just don’t think three-dimensional girls’ breasts bounce that much…Why are you so surprised?”</p>

<p>In the library after school.</p>

<p>The sound of rain from a sudden evening shower could be heard from outside the window.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t bring an umbrella, so I decided to study until the rain clouds passed and opened my textbook.</p>
<p>That’s when Tomori approached me.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised. I didn’t know that the top student in the school watches anime.”</p>

<p>And the way you just spoke sounds strangely familiar… I had a really bad feeling, but I asked.</p>

<p>“Did you come here just to tell me your thoughts?”</p>
<p>“Did you hit your head? How do you end up with such a self-conscious way of thinking?”</p>
<p>“Then why did you come here?”</p>
<p>“I just had some free time and wanted to read. And then…”</p>
<p>“Because I was here?”</p>
<p>“No, not really. Because there is a top student with great grades, but he’s an introverted creature who doesn’t do any class-representative work and only has a few friends. It’s kind of pitiful.”</p>

<p>That’s me.</p>
<p>Huh…Today, I’m going to retaliate against the class representative, who’s in full cussing mode again.</p>

<p>“Shall I guess the scientific name of that creature? It must be Kimitaka Kagisaka, right?”</p>
<p>“Wow, right on the mark.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Your attitude, Tomori. Your current abuse towards your classmates is definitely wrong. You should be everyone’s friend.”</p>
<p>“Hey, why don’t you just go die? I’ll play anime songs instead of chanting sutras at your funeral.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you go to the heavens? I’ll dedicate a Kimi Hana acrylic stand to your grave.”</p>

<p>I countered Tomori’s verbal attack with sarcasm.</p>
<p>The usual banter takes place in the ring known as the library.</p>
<p>(TN: Here, the “ring” is a metaphorical word that refers to a place where something like a fight occurs.)</p>

<p>“So, here’s the thing.”</p>

<p>As she swayed her chestnut-colored bob cut, Tomori nervously took a seat in front of me.</p>

<p>“What did you think, Kagisaka-kun?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“About Kimi Hana. You recommended it, so isn’t it the bare minimum of courtesy to at least share your thoughts?”</p>
<p>” …Okay. “</p>
<p>“Uh… really? “</p>
<p>“Just wait a moment. I want to get a drink.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re not allowed to eat or drink in the library. Go drink it outside, Troublemaker-kun.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I understand, Honor Student-san.”</p>

<p>Wearing a mask of composure, I headed toward the vending machine in the hallway.</p>

<p>（No way, right?)</p>

<p>I thought I was overthinking, but I checked the account I found on my smartphone from yesterday.</p>

<p>The latest tweet is</p>

<p>[Hooooraaaay! I got to talk with K-kun!]</p>
<p>[And in the library after school! Omg! It’s so youthful!]</p>
<p>[What is this? I’m so happy I could go crazy! Serotonin is overflowing in my head!]</p>

<p>Calm down.</p>
<p>She’s too different from Tomori. It’s not necessarily Tomori herself—</p>

<p>[Also, K-kun’s pen looks cool~]</p>
<p>” ! “</p>

<p>A photo was uploaded to tomochan’s account.</p>
<p>It’s a single pen placed on a desk.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but recognize its black and simple design.</p>

<p>“Seriously? “</p>

<p>As I stared at the picture of my own pen, [Everyone’s friend] tweeted again.</p>

<p>[But if you’re going to study, you could have invited me…]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Sigh…”</p>

<p>An empty classroom with no one around.</p>
<p>Drinking tea instead of my favorite canned coffee (which Tomori also liked) since it was sold out, I let out a sigh.</p>

<p>Ten minutes had passed since then.</p>
<p>I couldn’t bring myself to return to the library and study until I sorted out my feelings.</p>

<p>“Look, look! The video from the other day!”</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t that the one where Tomori-san helped out?”</p>

<p>I hear a conversation between a man and a woman I don’t know coming from the hallway.</p>

<p>“Yeah! It was the girls’ basketball practice game! Azusa-senpai made a three-point shot at the last moment and they won with a buzzer-beater against a strong school!”</p>
<p>“Seriously, she’s not even a member of the basketball team.”</p>
<p>“But honestly, she moves better than the regular players, and she understands all the tactics just by hearing them on the day of the game… Ah, I wish she would officially join!”</p>
<p>“It’s impossible, though. Tomori-san is good at both sports and studies, so she’s in high demand. Between you and me, there are rumors that there’s someone she likes.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Azusa-senpai?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s why she doesn’t join any clubs or the student council, and she even rejects confessions.”</p>
<p>“You seem to know a lot about this. Ah, do you also like Azusa-senpai too? “</p>
<p>“N-No, that is…!”</p>
<p>“I understand. She’s so easy to get along with that it’s easy to misunderstand and think, ‘Maybe we could be together.'”</p>
<p>“Geez, I know right? But she’s never had a boyfriend before!”</p>
<p>“Maybe she really likes someone.”</p>
<p>“…Damn. What kind of guy would make Tomori-san fall in love with?”</p>

<p>The boy’s voice is filled with envy.</p>
<p>I knew there were rumors like that, but I thought they were baseless gossip.</p>
<p>That is until I saw those tweets.</p>

<p>If her usual snappy remarks are just a front, and these tweets represent Tomori’s true feelings…</p>

<p>[K-kun, I’m still waiting for you…]</p>

<p>Unaware of my confusion, Tomori seemed to be unable to contain her excitement.</p>

<p>[I might never get another chance like this!]</p>
<p>[I stayed up all night watching all the episodes of Kimi Hana and studied!]</p>
<p>[Ah, but I’m a substitute for the tea ceremony club, so I might not be able to talk for a long time…]</p>

<p>“What does a substitute for the tea ceremony club even do?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure the tea ceremony club is all girls.</p>
<p>Maybe they just want to call her as a substitute and have a girls’ talk with [Everyone’s friends].</p>

<p>“Well, that’s convenient.”</p>

<p>Since she had plans afterward, Tomori wouldn’t be able to stay long.</p>
<p>So, I spent time in the empty classroom, watching the rain that showed no signs of stopping.</p>

<p>Kimitaka Kagisaka had a rule that resembled a goal.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t form connections with others at the academy.</p>
<p>Naturally, romance was out of the question.</p>

<p>Of course, it was also because he wanted to focus on studying to become independent, but there were other reasons as well.</p>
<p>Especially, he couldn’t afford to get closer to Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>That’s why he exchanged snappy remarks with her every day.</p>

<p>“Ah, isn’t Azusa-senpai like the vice-president in the same class? I heard they talk a lot.”</p>
<p>“Huh? No way. The story is that he’s an otaku, a socially awkward introvert who Tomori-san dislikes.”</p>

<p>My apologies for being a f*cking antisocial guy.</p>

<p>As I listened to their conversation in the hallway, I just kept waiting.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock indicate that 30 minutes have passed since I left the library.</p>

<p>（I guess she must have gotten tired of waiting and left.)</p>

<p>But, I couldn’t help but feel guilty.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the tweets filled with anticipation just a while ago, I couldn’t help but be overwhelmed with a sense of apology.</p>

<p>” ?! “</p>

<p>…are you serious?</p>
<p>As I peek inside the library, there she is——Tomori.</p>

<p>“No-no. What happened to be a substitute for the tea ceremony club?”</p>

<p>I mutter while hiding behind the door.</p>
<p>Oh well, I thought about killing some more time, but I couldn’t stop thinking about the scene I had seen for a moment.</p>
<p>Azusa Tomori stared at her red smartphone with a lonely expression.</p>

<p>Clearly, she looked anxious.</p>

<p>(No, don’t feel sorry for her.)</p>

<p>Remember the rules.</p>
<p>I just need to focus on my studies.</p>
<p>Even if I’m called an individualist or worse, as long as I maintain my top grades, it’s fine.</p>

<p>[…K-kun, what’s wrong? You’re not suddenly ill, are you?]</p>

<p>I wish she would just return to our usual banter, even for a moment.</p>
<p>However, what she wrote in her hidden account was her concern for an introverted guy like me.</p>

<p>“――You’re being too nice, Azusa Tomori.”</p>

<p>I mutter, then turn around and head back down the hallway.</p>
<p>I’m trying to remember. It wasn’t there earlier. If it can be found on campus, then――</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Sorry for keeping you waiting.”</p>

<p>After rushing back to the library, I apologize to Tomori.</p>

<p>” ….! …you’re too late!”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to thank me for my high level of patience? I wished a hundred times that you would end up in the hospital due to excessive hydration.”</p>

<p>No-no-no, you were really worried about me, and it showed. But, of course, I can’t say that. So I apologize.</p>

<p>“And why are you wet? Did you go out to play in the rain or something?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly, but at this point, feel free to say whatever you want as much as you want.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? What’s that supposed to mean? That’s not like you. Don’t tell me you’re feeling sorry.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. That’s why, here.”</p>
<p>“? A can of coffee? “</p>
<p>“I’ll treat you. 130 yen is too cheap for an apology, though.”</p>

<p>That’s right. No matter what the motivation was, Tomori was looking forward to it.</p>
<p>To have a lively conversation with a shared topic.</p>
<p>To study all night an anime she usually wouldn’t watch.</p>
<p>Probably even canceling plans with her friends from the tea ceremony club she promised to meet.</p>

<p>(I thought you would “shower me with your verbal punches.”)</p>

<p>I did something that actually deserved a slap――</p>

<p>“――Only this time, as a special exception.”</p>

<p>Sighing, Tomori accepts my canned coffee.</p>

<p>“I have no choice but to forgive you.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong. If you keep apologizing, it will draw too much attention in the library. Besides, why did you choose coffee?”</p>
<p>“Well, you like it, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“You drink this brand of canned coffee a lot. And today, you looked…sleepy.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell her that she looked like she had pulled an all-nighter, so I tried to cover it up.</p>

<p>“But this coffee…ah! “</p>

<p>Tomori seems to have realized something as she looks at my wet school uniform.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you went out in the rain to buy it for me? “</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb. This brand is only sold in two places on campus. The vending machine is in the hallway just past the library and the one next to the gym. And the one in the hallway is currently sold out.”</p>
<p>“As expected of an honor student. You have a good memory. “</p>
<p>“It’s the same for you. But…went to buy it without an umbrella…”</p>
<p>“You’re really a fool, aren’t you?” Tomori said and stood up from her chair.</p>
<p>” ? Where are you going? “</p>
<p>“Because eating and drinking are prohibited in the library, I’ll drink it outside. Stay here until I come back. If you leave, I won’t forgive you. I’ll chase after you and use your head as target practice with the empty can.”</p>

<p>Tomori says those unexpectedly harsh words before leaving the library.</p>

<p>（Are you still mad at me?)</p>

<p>Even though it’s her favorite brand, I guess canned coffee still feels too cheap.</p>
<p>As I ponder this, I take a peek at her secret account.</p>

<p>[Yesss! You’re backkk!!!]</p>

<p>Ah, I’m glad.</p>
<p>Tomori didn’t seem to be mad at me.</p>

<p>[You came back, K-kun… You came back!]</p>
<p>[Omg. You apologized sincerely! What’s with this sudden <em>dere</em> mode? It’s so adorable I could die!]</p>
<p>[Also, You remembered my favorite coffee~!]</p>

<p>“Are you a loyal dog praised by its owner?”</p>

<p>She expresses her joy, like burying a toy received as a reward with excitement.</p>
<p>She narrates the details as if showing off.</p>
<p>It somehow makes me feel warm and smile just watching her.</p>

<p>“Here, I brought you a towel. It would be troublesome if you caught a cold because of me… Wait, why are you smiling by yourself?”</p>

<p>Five minutes later.</p>
<p>Tomori gives me a sharp glare, and I try to brush it off with a nonchalant “It’s nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look at that!”</p>
<p>“Huh? That can’t be true. Why is Tomori with that guy…!”</p>

<p>The man and woman from earlier whisper from the entrance of the library.</p>
<p>I sense a mix of shock and envy from the whispers and their eyes, but unfortunately, I don’t have the energy to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Because I’ve discovered the hidden account of [Everyone’s friend]</p>

<p>There are various other mysteries and problems, but for now, let’s enjoy our time talking about a common topic.</p>
<p>Although the library prohibits eating and drinking, and there’s also no cola or sweets available―</p>

<p>―For some reason, it feels like we can still have a pleasant time.</p>
