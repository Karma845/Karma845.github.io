<h1>Chapter 11 - Connecting with You</h1>


<p>Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>In this private Aisu Academy, there’s hardly a student who doesn’t know her name.</p>
<p>She is the beloved [Everyone’s friend.].</p>

<p>However, even such a girl has one student who doesn’t get along with her.</p>
<p>That student’s name is Kimitaka Kagisaka.</p>
<p>Their classmates are well aware of this fact.</p>

<p>As proof, two days after the incident at the karaoke place, when Tomori came to school in high spirits, everyone warmly welcomed her except for him.</p>
<p>[Well, I guess that’s just how Kagisaka is.]</p>

<p>I overheard such whispers from my classmates.</p>
<p>Yes, just because such an incident happened doesn’t mean the relationship between Tomori and me will dramatically change.</p>
<p>And so, Tomori and I were once again engrossed in our own world today.</p>

<p>****</p>

<p>“Kagisaka-kun! Didn’t you read my message yes and ignored it yesterday?”</p>

<p>The orange-tinted space was illuminated by the evening sun.</p>
<p>While I was working on the class documents to submit, Tomori pounced on me like a Chihuahua whose tail had been stepped on.</p>

<p>“You didn’t reply all night! I sent you a message at 8 PM! You were still awake, right?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. There was a streaming show I wanted to watch and I had to concentrate.”</p>

<p>That’s a lie.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was busy responding to a DM from Chifuyu, aka Kouhai-chan, so I couldn’t focus on anything else.</p>

<p>【Thank you so much, Senpai! For helping Azusa!】</p>

<p>I didn’t explain the whole situation, but apparently, Chifuyu concluded that I was the one who saved Tomori.</p>

<p>(It was tough when she asked to meet in person to express her gratitude.)</p>

<p>It took until late at night to calm her down. That’s why I couldn’t reply to her message.</p>

<p>“You heartless! I even exchanged LINE with you at your request.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Tomori’s memory unreliable? You were the one who asked first.”</p>

<p>I retorted with my usual banter.</p>
<p>Then, Tomori took out her smartphone.</p>

<p>【Oh? You remember that well. Yet you conveniently forgot to reply to me.】</p>
<p>“Did you forget how to be polite this time? Going out of your way to be sarcastic using LINE.”</p>
<p>【Date: June 3rd. Charge: Kagisaka-kun ignored the message. Verdict: Death penalty】</p>
<p>“Your Honor, I appeal against this unjust conviction!”</p>

<p>I said while looking at her phone, and then a stamp of a Golden Retriever-like character, screaming [You’re the one who’s bad!], was sent with furious momentum.</p>

<p>[——Tonight, exchange LINE with me.]</p>

<p>That was the words I uttered in the park that night.</p>

<p>[Huuhhhh? That’s the method?]</p>
<p>[Yes, on the day we met at the café, you asked me, remember? You wanted to exchange LINE.]</p>
<p>[W-Well, that’s true, but…!]</p>
<p>[Why are you so surprised?]</p>
<p>[Because you had such a serious expression! You were teasing me, weren’t you?]</p>
<p>[Ah, I got caught. Well, forgive me since I’m going out of my way to fulfill your request.]</p>
<p>[Scum! You’re really a hopeless jerk!]</p>

<p>Tomori got angry and started hitting me playfully, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>It’s better to change the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I thought it might calm the crying Tomori down too.</p>

<p>(I’m glad it turned out well in the end.)</p>

<p>After successfully calming down the angry Tomori, we managed to exchange LINE.</p>
<p>Later, I took her to a nighttime hospital where a doctor who had taken care of me during her Kazarina days worked.</p>
<p>I was worried about her injuries.</p>

<p>《…Idiot, idiot, idiot. You created such a serious atmosphere, but why didn’t you confess?》</p>
<p>《But still, this is incredibly exciting!》</p>
<p>《I got K-kun’s LINE——This may be a small step, but it’s still a great step for tomochan!!》</p>

<p>‘Tomohō!’ Seeing Tomori using her secret account in the seat next to me in the waiting room, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>If she’s this energetic, her injuries must be minor.</p>

<p>“By the way, don’t get mad over a small read-ignore.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like a conversation between a couple at the beginning of a relationship, and it’s awkward.”</p>
<p>“Huh? You’re so self-conscious it’s creepy?”</p>

<p>The class president sighed, saying that ‘Fortunately, we were the only ones in this classroom, so no one would hear such things from us.’</p>

<p>“But, was it okay? That you helped me with work after school?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I reflected on myself after that incident.”</p>
<p>“Uhh… Does that mean you think you relied too much on me alone?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. When I leave you alone, Tomori, you tend to do reckless things. Like a rabid dog rushing in front of its favorite food. I didn’t realize it.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that!?”</p>
<p>“It means exactly what it says. So, from now on…”</p>

<p>I decided to fulfill Tomori’s requests which have been made multiple times since April this year.</p>

<p>“If Tomori wants it, I’ll support you.”</p>
<p>“…does that include the duties of the class committee?”</p>
<p>“No, not just that. Any other consultations or help with relationships, everything.”</p>
<p>“…What’s gotten into you? I can’t believe you’re saying that.”</p>
<p>“If I were to express my opinion as the vice president, I wouldn’t want you to get involved in any trouble again.”</p>

<p>Yes, just because such an incident happened doesn’t mean my relationship with Tomori will dramatically change.</p>
<p>But——with courage, I hope I can bring about some changes, even if they’re small.</p>
<p>Exchanging LINE and connecting with Tomori is part of that.</p>

<p>[If it’s Senpai, I believe you can give good advice and support Azusa!]</p>

<p>Chifuyu’s words resurface in my mind.</p>
<p>Yes, in a way, we’re similar.</p>

<p>I was a delinquent. Tomori is friends with the students at the academy.</p>
<p>We’ve both solved various troubles with people.</p>
<p>And I made mistakes during my delinquent days that made me want to die.</p>
<p>That’s why…</p>

<p>(That’s why I can use that experience.)</p>

<p>[——but there’s no such thing as a person who never fails. The reflection on today’s mistakes can be fixed tomorrow.]</p>

<p>I said that to Tomori, but those words were a beautiful boomerang.</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori is kind to everyone and always ready to help; ironically, she is not good at relying on anyone and has no equal with whom she can open her heart and connect deeply.</p>
<p>But I can. I can support Tomori.</p>
<p>Yes, if I can apply the experiences I learned as the leader of Kazarina———</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s okay.”</p>

<p>After a short pause, Tomori nodded.</p>

<p>(Ah, I’m glad.)</p>

<p>Of course, there are various challenges, like balancing it with studies and being cautious not to expose my past to Tomori.</p>
<p>But still. I want to be Azusa Tomori’s strength.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I guess I’ll be Kagisaka-kun’s support since there’s no choice.”</p>

<p>Hmm?</p>

<p>“I also reflected on this incident. I didn’t realize Kagisaka-kun could be such a dangerous person. He was like a rabid dog diving into the bait.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Even though it was to help me, you went on a rampage and roughly turned your enemies into a bloodbath. I knew it; you’re a scary otaku when you lose your temper. People like that need to be monitored closely and properly rehabilitated.”</p>
<p>“But it’s because of my rampage that you were saved?”</p>

<p>I was surprised to hear Tomori’s typical way of speaking, and I was surprised to find myself arguing against her.</p>

<p>(Well, it seems impossible to quickly become close friends like this.)</p>

<p>Seeing Tomori’s responses, which she couldn’t easily become sincere, I felt it would be difficult to shorten the distance between us.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t intend to change the rule of not dating in high school.</p>
<p>Therefore, our relationship of exchanging harsh words is unlikely to change soon. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>


<p>“Hmph. I’ll support you, so the least you could do is say thank you.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather die, even under torture, I wouldn’t say it. Besides, what can a problem child like you do for me?”</p>
<p>“…arbitrating fights?”</p>
<p>“Stop! I only see a future where it turns into a bloodbath!”</p>
<p>“Are you mistaking me for a mass murderer or something?”</p>
<p>“Wait, let me think of a job that even a loner boy like you can do…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say things like a mother encouraging her unemployed son.”</p>
<p>“Ah, how about helping out the track and field team? I heard there’s a marathon event coming up, so why not experience a taste of hell?”</p>
<p>“You’re more suited for that. Your leg power is like that of an orangutan, okay?”</p>
<p>“Are you dumb? Orangutans have developed grip strength, huh?”</p>
<p>“As expected, you know a lot about your own species.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be told that by someone with the delicacy level of an ape.”</p>

<p>A light-hearted banter ensued in the classroom.</p>
<p>It may seem like an intense exchange with others, but this is also our form of communication.</p>
<p>Maybe a relationship like ours cannot exist without banter.</p>

<p>“You’re useless. I guess I’ll have to train you to be capable of work.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s true I’m not as skilled in communication as Tomori.”</p>
<p>“Um… w-well, it’s not that I’m that good…”</p>
<p>“Tomori, you’re surprisingly easy to flatter.”</p>
<p>“——Hee? Since you can flatter me, if you try hard, maybe you can get along with everyone?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s…”</p>
<p>“Until you can get along, your job is to do odd jobs.”</p>
<p>“That’s quite a low position.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make you work like a slave. Besides, just the fact that you’re not alone is a relief. Show some gratitude that I’ll rely on a problem child like you.”</p>

<p>Yes, even with things we can’t do alone, we can do together.</p>
<p>For example, Tomori can handle the communication aspect that I struggle with.</p>
<p>And I can handle the troubles that Tomori’s straightforward approach doesn’t work on.</p>
<p>Together, we can complement each other’s shortcomings.</p>

<p>(Besides, being alone all the time is exhausting.)</p>

<p>[Everyone’s friend.]</p>
<p>Rather than being a perfect honor student loved by everyone all the time, it’s better to have someone who can let her show her relaxed side and be on equal footing.</p>

<p>(That’s why, I’ll be that person.)</p>

<p>I’ll be the kind of partner that the ever-strong, ever-kind hero can rely on and show her vulnerable side without worries.</p>
<p>I promise.</p>

<p>(However, if there’s one thing to say…)</p>

<p>——My feelings towards Tomori won’t change.</p>
<p>Even if I declare myself as her friend, exchange LINE, and continue to work together as troubleshooters at school in the future.</p>
<p>That should never change.</p>

<p>【——Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for saying you’ll support me.】</p>

<p>However…</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but gasp my breath when I saw the message displayed on my phone.</p>
<p>Tomori was sitting across from me, nonchalantly checking the documents I had prepared.</p>

<p>Her left hand was tucked into the pocket of her skirt.</p>

<p>【Since I can’t say it directly, as I said before, I’ll just write it here.】</p>
<p>【I’m really happy to become your friend.】</p>
<p>【I know it might be difficult right away, but if it’s the two of us, I believe we can become good friends. Yes, to put it like my childhood friend did. 】</p>
<p>【The best partner you’ll ever have.】</p>

<p>She must be typing with her usual touch typing skill.</p>

<p>Hmm, that’s fine.</p>
<p>Tomori’s message was too straightforward, but compared to the tweets she had posted until now, it wasn’t as embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, the problem is——</p>

<p>“Hey, Tomori.”</p>
<p>“What? Do you remember there is a mistake in the documents? I knew it, you problem child——”</p>
<p>“Just now, I received a LINE from you.”</p>
<p>“——Yes?”</p>

<p>As I was about to take out my phone, the color drained from Tomori’s face.</p>

<p>Missend. It was a common mistake on social media.</p>
<p>I guess she was really happy when I said I would support her.</p>

<p>Either due to excessive excitement or carelessness, Tomori had mistakenly sent the message she intended for her secret account to our LINE conversation.</p>
<p>Well, these kinds of funny accidents can happen when you get along with someone.</p>
<p>That’s what human relationships are all about.</p>

<p>“Wait, it’s not what you think!”</p>

<p>Tomori stood up in a state of panic.</p>

<p>“What do you mean it’s not what I think?”</p>
<p>“Well, um, this, it’s something I wanted to say to you…”</p>
<p>“Then why did you write it in our LINE conversation?”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s…!”</p>
<p>“[I’m really happy to become your friend. I know it might be difficult right away, but if it’s the two of us, I believe we can become good friends. Yes, to put it like my childhood friend did. The best partner you’ll ever have.]”</p>
<p>“Stop it! Don’t read it out loud~!”</p>

<p>‘I was just teasing!’ ‘I only did it to embarrass you!’</p>
<p>It was a forced explanation.</p>

<p>Immediately after, on her secret account, she posts:</p>

<p>《Accidental post! Absolutely not! From now on, no matter what happens, I’ll only tweet about my feelings for K-kun on my secret account!》</p>

<p>Ah, that’s more like it.</p>
<p>Somehow, my determination not to change my feelings for Tomori almost wavers when she makes such adorable blunder.</p>

<p>“Hey, why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s not that Tomori’s message was funny.”</p>
<p>“Then why?”</p>
<p>“That’s… a secret.”</p>
<p>“Huh? We’re supposed to be working together, and you’re already keeping secrets? You really have the worst personality!”</p>

<p>‘Why can’t you be more honest?’ Tomori yelled.</p>
<p>Well, maybe things would be easier in many ways if I could be more honest. But it’s still impossible.</p>
<p>I’m sure our relationship will change once we become lovers, but for now, I want to enjoy this a little bit more.</p>

<p>Azusa Tomori.</p>
<p>——It’s been a while since I had a connection with a classmate.</p>
