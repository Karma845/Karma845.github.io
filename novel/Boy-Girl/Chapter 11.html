<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; [Nee, Onii] </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My family just moved to our new home the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have just moved into our new house. But we already have dishes, summer clothes, and studying materials such as pens, notebooks, and textbooks, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had unpacked the things we needed for our daily life. But in my room, there’re still lots of boxes that I have yet to unpack</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, shall we open them?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I got home, I changed my clothes and got down to the task of unpacking and sorting. For the next few days, I guess I’ll be busy sorting and organizing these stuffs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike my house in Tsukinose, which was unnecessarily spacious, my current house was a three-bedroom apartment with a very limited space. Unfortunately, it’s giving me quite a headache</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Onii, are you there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without waiting for an answer, Himeko enters the room</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is still in her school uniform and has a smartphone in her hand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s father, he said that he’s going to see mother again]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you implying that I’m supposed to make dinner?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, that’s correct. Also, why don’t you take out your smartphone? You haven’t added my number, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahaha, sorry, sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mou!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I listened to Himeko’s annoyed voice and went to the refrigerator</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday and this morning, I had used all the ingredients in the fridge for cleaning, so it’s kinda empty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s empty, what happened with the contents?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Onii]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, I felt a tug on the back of my shirt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, I saw Himeko’s face with a bit of melancholy on it, as if she was holding something back. Her face reminded me of something that happened in the past</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But himeko, in a very cheerful voice, begged for my help</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m… really in the mood for hamburger today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s going to take a lot of work since I have to go to the supermarket]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know, I’ll help you, ok?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If my sister asked me a favor with such look, there’s no way I could refuse</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko, who was hurrying to get going, already had her household purse in her hand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like she doesn’t want to go alone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ruffled her head in a slightly rough manner</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait, what are you doing?! You’re messing up my hair!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s okay, that’s why you’re here, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, uhn&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, let’s go early before the sun goes down. I still don’t know where the supermarket is]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mou… Onii can’t help it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to sound cheerful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we left our house, Himeko naturally walked fast and pulled me along, as if to shake her anxiety</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my neighborhood, there’s a very ordinary supermarket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A variety of vegetables, fresh foods such as meat and fish, many kinds of drinks including milk, and seasonings. A variety of colorful snacks and small sundries. It’s a supermarket with nothing special to mention for people who used to live here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was different for both of us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to shopping in the neighborhood, the only places we knew were the old and miscellaneous private stores that they run as a hobby, the purchasing department of the agricultural cooperative, and the roadside station a little further down the road. For me and Himeko, this place was like a food amusement center, with all sorts of things in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this day, we established a new rule to not spend more than 200 yen for a single sweets. That way, we won’t waste too much money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned from shopping, the sun had already set. I turned on the light and started to cook as soon as possible</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Himeko, chop up the vegetables and I’ll chop the mushrooms]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Understood. But are we going to use lots of vegetables? Are you going to make Yokubari Hamburger?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha, don’t worry, I’ve been eating lots of vegetables that I started to get tired of it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yokubari Hamburger Steak is a hamburger steak that is covered with a lot of vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to onions, cabbage and eggplants are added to the base mixture, and the sweetness of the vegetables and the fat of the minced meat are absorbed to enhance the steak flavour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, I used to add all kinds of vegetables that were given to me. But after lots of trial and error, I came up with this mixture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I put on it is Japanese mushroom sauce made from various mushrooms such as Shiitake, Shimeji, Maitake, Enoki, and Eringi. Boiled down with soy sauce, mirin, and sugar, and thickened with water-soluble potato starch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes well not only with hamburgers but also with white fish, omelets, and pasta sauces. So I make a lot and store the rest in Tupperware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you don’t want to waste your vegetables scraps, add them to the miso soup and dinner is ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itadakimasu~! Mmm, It’s hot!!! Onii, water!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, yes, here. Eat slowly, won’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was around 8 o’clock when dinner was ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Himeko was fussing over the hot food. I let out a sigh and gave her some water. Her cheeks loosened up as she ate her meal with relish. The thickly seasoned hamburger steak went well with the white rice, as did our empty stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As expected, your sauce has a flavor that went well with alcohol]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Himeko, you’ve never drank alcohol. Well, I got the approval that it goes well with dry Shochu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuhihi, Well, it’s delicious]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My pleasure]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Onii first hamburger steak was this one, wasn’t it? It’s a memorable taste for me… You’ve gotten really good at cooking, haven’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, keep up the great work!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Himeko, learn to cook won’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Frozen on instant? I’m ready to go!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geez…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato and Himeko. Brother and sister. A conversation in a cheerful voice, on a dinner table, just the two of us, a table that was too big for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table is too big for both of us, and it made us feel a bit lonely. But… this is a very common sight for us.</span></p>
