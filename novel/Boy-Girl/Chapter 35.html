<h3>Chapter 35 &#8211; You&#039;re Not Leaving</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just kidding.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s voice was cheerful, a complete change from the air she had just been earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;O-Okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response. Hayato squeezed his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he was distracted, but his hands were loosened from their connection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We walked a lot back then. I&#8217;ve seen this area from the train, but I&#8217;ve never walked here before&#8230; It&#8217;s kind of like exploring.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m completely new to this whole thing&#8230; So are we back on the right track?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, if you get lost, you can just check the map. Isn&#8217;t there an app on your phone for that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Found it, but it looks more of a maze than a map though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Compared to Tsukinose&#8230; what&#8217;s that place?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that a bakery called &#8216;Don&#8217;t Stop!&#8217;? Two loaves of bread for 980 yen, I don&#8217;t know what’s up with that, and it&#8217;s expensive!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just as they talked and talked, she regained her usual tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as they used to go into the mountains to explore new places, they would find unexpected stores and signs in the buildings instead of the trees, and they would have a lively conversation. It&#8217;s all business as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was clearly Haruki&#8217;s deception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a wall of reticence, created by the seven-year gap between him and Haruki, that refused to let him step further into the weakness she had shown earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he looked right next to her, he saw Haruki smiling as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This disturbed Hayato’s heart even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just how long had they been walking around talking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And before they knew it, they’ve reached the nearest station where Hayato’s house was located.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re at our station.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, isn’t it too early for dinner? I&#8217;m worried about the hem of my skirt, so I&#8217;ll just go home and&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hayato&#8230;? I&#8217;m just going to change my clothes. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll make sure Hime gets her regular clothes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, um&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was too pushy. He didn&#8217;t listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pulled Haruki, who had a troubled look of dismay on her face, without uttering a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was Hayato&#8217;s intention. So there was nothing logical about his actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he twisted out of his mouth the excuses he’d been trying so hard to come up with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;You see, I still haven&#8217;t played with Haruki enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t want to send Haruki back to her house. He just took Haruki to his house without looking back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Hayato is unaware of how he&#8217;s saying something so risqué, and doesn&#8217;t notice the expression on Haruki&#8217;s face as he pulls away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just before four o&#8217;clock in the summer, when the sun was still too high to be called evening. The time is indescribably halfway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the afternoon, it&#8217;s natural to want to loosen up and stretch your wings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hayato and Haruki returned home, they were greeted by Himeko who looked back at them as if she was making a giggling sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ring-shaped controller was in Himeko&#8217;s hand, and the TV screen showed a game she was playing. There were some notebooks and problem books spread out on the table, indicating that she had been studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You see, muscles are.. your lifelong companion.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato made a dumbfounded face at Himeko, who made bitter excuses with the incendiary phrases in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Education and knowledge too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been studying a lot, and I think I need to relax, and I also think I shouldn&#8217;t be too lazy to exercise, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaa~…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she had been studying properly, it seemed that they had come back home at the wrong time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kirishima siblings looked at each other with weird faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Haruki saw her childhood friends, she felt strange and shook her shoulders, due to the gap in the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hahaha, Hime-chan is taking her high school exams this year? Yes, yes, it&#8217;s necessary to take a break, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, of course! I&#8217;ve been studying hard all this time!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, is that the one where you move your body? I’m also interested in that. I&#8217;ll teach you how to study later, and we can do it together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haru-chan understands me! It’s fine, right, Onii?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Jeez, fine.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the interaction with Himeko, the somewhat tense atmosphere that existed between Hayato and Haruki until then had dissipated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki, as well as Hayato, became actively involved in the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they could only play one at a time, it was a good way to exercise the whole body, and the three of them taking turns was just the right style. Haruki&#8217;s excitement was especially great. [PRN: They were probably playing Ring Fit.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, here, take that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she shouted, she moved her whole body excessively. At first glance, it may seem futile, but it is a movement that earns points and is fascinating to watch. And occasionally, she would look at Hayato or Himeko with a look of pride on her face. It was clear that she was conscious of her ability to charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Haruki is dressed in a white one-piece summer dress that is still neat and clean, but has a lot of skin tone area around the shoulders and thighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do some kind of strenuous exercise, you would be able to see and couldn&#8217;t hide your sensitive parts in this kind of outfit. And she probably doesn&#8217;t even know it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu, Haru-chan, your glances are so erotic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Himeko, you sound and smell like an old man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, what do you think? How do you like your outfit today, Haru-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she pretty to look at…? Well, it&#8217;s Haruki, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oho~, I see, I see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What did you just say!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Hayato&#8217;s objective point of view, Haruki is certainly a kind of beautiful girl. There are times when she feels a bit awkward. In fact, even now, she was showing her agitated appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hayato sees her with a disappointing feeling, similar to his sister Himeko. That should be it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey! Did you see that? Now I have the highest score!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aaah! Next time I&#8217;m going to&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just take it easy, okay? I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll get some sore muscles tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko responded to Haruki&#8217;s agitation, and the place became more exciting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had curry and a pork cutlet for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He cuts into the muscle and fats of the pork and season it thoroughly with salt, pepper and grated ginger. At first, he fries it slowly at a low temperature and then crisply at a high temperature to make the batter more crispy and the meat more juicy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pork cutlet goes well with all kinds of sauces, but it also goes relatively well with the leftover summer vegetable curry. Thanks to this, everyone ate well, and Haruki and Himeko complained once again that they were going to get fat after eating all the curry. They both said “I’m gonna get fat” in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Himeko tried to get back into the game, saying that she had eaten too much and needed to exercise more, but as expected, she was not allowed to do so and studied under Haruki&#8217;s guidance as promised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we just have to substitute 4 for y.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait a minute, Haru-chan, where did that 4 come from? There&#8217;s no 4 anywhere in the text!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have x+y=12 at the beginning, is that where you start?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How do you know that without calculating, or rather, it&#8217;s actually correct!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s method of studying was intuitive, and it was difficult to say that she was making any progress, but even so, she proceeded in a friendly manner despite Himeko&#8217;s comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato watched the two of them in the background, washing the dishes and staring at the instruction manual for the phone he had just bought, thinking about what had happened today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we cut the air out of this moment, we can say that they’ve returned to their daily lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for sure, a lot had happened today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I can&#8217;t just pretend that I didn&#8217;t see it&#8230; Right?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s how intense Haruki&#8217;s face was at that moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, It&#8217;s about time. I have to go home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s past nine. Onii, send her off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something was tugging at his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s something similar to the feeling of having brought someone here by force, but not having said what needed to be said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hayato doesn&#8217;t know what to do, so he follows Himeko to the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, heavy rain!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s really pouring hard.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment they opened the door, they were greeted by a sound that seemed to hit their earlobes like a static.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato didn&#8217;t notice it when he was in his room, but it was already raining quite heavily outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a perfect example of turning the bucket upside down, and it makes him wonder how much sense an umbrella would make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walking in this rain might ruin the summer dress Haruki had just unloaded today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t help it, can you lend me an umbrella?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm. Oh sure&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passing through the common corridor, they boarded the elevator and headed for the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air she had felt earlier when she was at Hayato&#8217;s house was nowhere to be found, and something mysterious was flowing in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was nothing to talk about, the atmosphere was like the end of a festival, and it continued until Haruki was about to run outside in the pouring rain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, maybe I don&#8217;t need this umbrella. I&#8217;ll just run.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayato found himself grabbing Haruki&#8217;s arm as she tried to run away. Her face was as serious as could be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave. Stay overnight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruki&#8217;s expression hardened at the sudden offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her surprise was drowned out by the sound of the heavy midnight rain simply </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pounding the ground and roof.</span></p>
