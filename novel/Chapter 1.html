<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Departure</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dad,
Mom,...... I'm back."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
successfully taking revenge on Garou, the beastman, he leaves </span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">. The first place Raito
visit is the grave of his parents in his hometown.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't know if it was demons, bandits, the army, or something else, but the
village had been destroyed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I got out of Naraku after overcoming various obstacles and leveling up, I went
to check on the village. I found that my hometown had already been overrun. My
parents and the villagers had been killed, and their corpses had been left
untouched. The buildings, fields, and livestock sheds had been burned to the
ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
tried to identify the culprits of the crime, but it was too difficult due to
the passage of time, and I couldn't tell if the culprit is a demon or other
races.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
only fortunate thing is that there were no bodies of my big brother and my
sister Yume among the countless corpses. We searched the whole village and the surrounding
area, but their body hasn't been found.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(Maybe
the two of them have escaped safely and still alive.......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
such hope in my heart, I ordered my men to gather information, search for the
two, and find the culprit who had destroyed the village.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">About
half a year ago, I recovered my parents' bodies, the villagers, and the
children then made their graves. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I put
flowers in front of the grave and prayed that my parents and the villagers
would rest in peace.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
I finished praying, I stood up and wiped the dirt from my knees.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Are you done?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">One
of my guards and fellow adventurers, "UR, level 5000, Gold the Golden
Knight," who had been watching over my prayers, called out to me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
the name "Golden Knight" implies, the armor he wore from head to toe
and the shield he carried were golden, making him look very distinctive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">His
offensive abilities are not too high, but he is a defensive type. That is why
he was chosen to accompany me this time. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
greeted Dad and Mom and told them what's going on."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"If
we want to reach our destination while there's still daylight and rest at the
inn, then we'd better get going. I don't want to spend my first day in the
wild."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gold!
How dare you talk like that to Raito-sama when he's still grieving! And you
must speak respectfully!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
girl standing next to Gold is angry at his comment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is also one of my guards and fellow adventurers, "UR, Level 5000, Nemumu
the Assassin Blade".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is a beautiful seven or eightteen year old girl with beautiful silver hair just
above her shoulders, brown skin, and a scarf covering her mouth.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
looked at me, who had just been visiting the grave, with a worried look on her
face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She is
looking at me as if she was stabbed in the chest with a knife and in pain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold's
careless words made her angry.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
Gold paid no attention to what Nemumu said and shrugged his shoulders.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
boring to use the honorific language because it doesn't feel friendly. Besides,
Nemumu, you also don't want to spend your first day in the wild, do you?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
not like you! I will always accompany Raito-sama. Even if I have to sleep on
the grass, in the mud, or in the garbage!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Me
too, I'll company my Lord, even in the coldest winter mountain or on the
hottest magma. It is the chivalrous spirit of the "Golden Knight" to
offer golden loyalty to my Lord. However, if we want to make sure that my Lord
has a comfortable sleeping environment, isn't it natural that we should avoid
camping out in the open."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Huh!?
We, well, if we consider Raito-sama sleep quality and health, it's true that we
should avoid camping...."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't want to tell you this, but I don't think it's a good idea for Nemumu-dono
to show off your loyalty too much. If you're too pushy, the Lord may hate you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"That,
that, that's not true. Right? Raito-sama would never hate us! Above all, even
if he hates me, I will keep serving him as a loyal servant! Even if I die and
become a soul, I will do my best to support him!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
let out a shocking tone of voice, and Nemumu's voice trembled as her beautiful
eyes became teary.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
wasn't their intention to do so, but the gloomy atmosphere has changed as if
blown away by fresh air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
couldn't help but let out a smile.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/q71p8VL/000018.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
okay, Nemumu. I'm not going to hate you. Gold, don't tease her too much."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You're
too kind and excellent. Sometimes if you don't say it openly, then your loyal
servant won't understand it......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu's
face lights up again, and Gold shrugs his shoulders and spreads his hands while
saying, "Yareyare".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Well,
let's go. I also don't like the idea of camping outside on the first day."
</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Actually,
if we end up in the wild, I can just use the power of the "SSR,
Transfer" card I got from the infinite gacha to return to Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" lang="X-NONE" class="calibre2">It is awkward to
return to "Naraku" from the first day I went out, so I would like to
avoid it.</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As I
turn my back from my parents' graves, I wear a black hood and a staff from my item
box. I also wear the SSR Clown Mask from the Infinity Gacha.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
look back at my parents' graves one more time before I leave.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(I
wasn't the "Master". Because of that, the "Race Union"
almost killed me just to keep their secret. Regardless of that, how is it
possible that the village where I born and raised coincidentally destroyed, and
everyone in the village slaughtered?)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
you think about it normally, it's "not possible".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No
matter how many monsters and bandits attacked the village near the virgin
forest, there was no way it could be openly destroyed like this.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(My
opponent is the nation. The country tried to kill me just to be sure. It's my
birthplace, so there's a good chance they are the one who destroyed it.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't know why they went that far, but I can't ignore the possibility.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
the nation really did destroy my village "just to be sure"....</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dad,
Mom, and everyone in the village - I'm going to reveal the truth. I'm going to
find out what the "Master" is, why I had to be killed, the culprits
who destroyed the village. I'm going to get revenge on the Races Union members who
betrayed and tried to kill me. I swear I'll get it done."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Then,
if the truth is twisted, tragic, and evil, I will not hesitate to spread death,
destruction, and slaughter. As the one who brings despair poison, I'll burn the
world with hellfires."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsuu!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nemumu
is absolutely loyal to me that she would give her soul to me, while Gold has an
easy-going attitude and always wearing a full-face helmet. But they also gasped
and look frightened when they heard my words.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
could feel the birds flying away from the nearby virgin forest, and the beasts
and monsters were running away from me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
had to calm myself down because I couldn't enter the city or even approach it
at this point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
less than a few seconds, I had calmed down my mind.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dad,
Mom, everyone - I'm off.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
finished my greeting and I turned my back to the grave.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......Shall
we go then?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes,
yes, I'll accompany you anywhere!", Nemumu said.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
Lord, don't unleash that kind of murderous intention in the city. We are fine,
but ordinary people's heart may stop when exposed to such murderous intention."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As I
started to walk away, Nemumu following me, stammering and shouting cheerfully
to hide her fear.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
also doesn't talk much and starts to walk away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
this way, my story of revenge and searching for the truth began.</span></p>
