<h2>Chapter 1 - Senior blows the world through the window.</h2>

<b>Part 1</b></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's wrong with you? Whether it's your appearance, or your eyes, your lips, and your wrinkles, it all becomes your appearance. Whether it's your voice, your breath when you talk and laugh, or when your tears run down your cheeks, when you talk to me; including your character, words, desires, and dreams, to me. In other words, it's all this that is what makes you unique.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Excerpt from the embarrassing love letter that Amaharashi Asahi wrote in the past</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a moonlit night. Fresh air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The night breeze slowly passed between Asahi and Senpai. Senpai who was wearing cute pajamas with cat pattern, was standing on the balcony of her room, smoothing her long hair. It was like seeing the joy of Asahi's heart oozing out of his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;Can't lose one-sidedly to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today! We have to decide the outcome with her tonight!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi tightened his body and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai. Is there something wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the window of Asahi's room to senpai's balcony, the distance&#8212;as long as both sides reach out to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The house where Asahi moved was close to his senpai's house. Especially Asahi's room and Senpai's room. Asahi didn't understand this well&#8212;perhaps the people who built the house ignored civil law. But Asahi was also blessed by her. Although there was a slight difference in angles, the rooms of the two of them were opposite each other and were basically the same height. His senpai often threw pebbles at the window pane and told Asahi to come out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, the story becomes interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Would you like to play a game with me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Games?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. I bought a very interesting game.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's voice always sounded like a steadiness far beyond her years. Only when it reached her&nbsp;ears from the balcony would she become as emotional as a child looking at a cake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After I saw that, I suddenly thought of Asahi-kun's face. I thought of Asahi-kun's blushing face as usual. Then I thought of this game. Do you want to play against me? If you think you can beat me, would you want to fight me? Want to try? Try?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The elusive Senpai seemed to be saying: 'Asahi can't beat me.'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is clearly provocative. Asahi understood this. At the same time, he also understood that he couldn't step aside when his senpai said this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Precisely because the other party was senpai, he didn't want to be afraid of being scared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of game is that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If I tell you, it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make sense to eat a dark hot pot with the lights on. But if Asahi-kun beats me, I'll give you a reward. It's me. A gift for Asahi-kun that was carefully prepared"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai leaned her&nbsp;left hand on the balcony railing and pushed her&nbsp;body slightly forward. Today is sunny, but soon it will rain. Asahi's room clothes and senpai's pajamas were very thin. She leaned forward, making Asahi's eyes wonder where to put it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's the prize? Is this some kind of trap?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This isn't a trap. I can fulfill any one of Asahi-kun's wishes &#8211; whatever it is. I think so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"... Whatever?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Anything? Oh. Whatever it is, it's fine. Isn't that bad? ...Ah, Asahi-kun is too fast. Cheeks turning red? Are you thinking about something naughty?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I, I didn't think about it!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't even look at senpai's plump breasts&#8212;Asahi couldn't say this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was just thinking&#8212;is this really a trap? After two months, I learned quite a bit. Senpai will talk about this kind of thing, basically because she wants to do something. If senpai wins, what do you want to do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um... at first I wanted to say "Let Asahi-kun fulfill my wish", but it's too normal for me to beat you. I can't say this line. So forget it, you notice me a bit. Just a wish, a wish that a child could do. do. Does Asahi-kun still think that this is a trap?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai's bid for such good conditions is basically nothing good.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi replied, causing senpai to smile slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her mature and beautiful appearance showed a slightly evil and provocative expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Even so, Asahi-kun would agree to toy with me right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"... So ."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi nodded. That's right, tonight-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">this time&#8212; I have to decide the outcome with senpai!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I promise you. I want to ask, what kind of tour is that&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Play&#8212;Asahi was speechless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai smiled, slowly got out of the armrest, and stretched out her&nbsp;right hand. By the way, she always hides her&nbsp;right hand behind her&nbsp;back very naturally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A lollipop crossed the sky and reached Asahi's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai muttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's blue cheese flavor."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I like the sweets made by this manufacturer. This manufacturer makes a very strange limited time taste. I thought it was delicious, but all my family members thought it tasted weird. So, this is a game that suits Asahi-kun's taste."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well&#8212; Asahi was taken aback. After he realized senpai's intentions, he became afraid.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He wasn't afraid of the taste of blue cheese. Asahi's tastes are very similar to his father's&#8212;both have strong tastes, and both taste the delights of the mountains and the sea. His cousin has also said in the past that their "gold tongue and wooden tongue are really only separated by a piece of paper." In that case, what was he afraid of?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If Asahi-kun can eat it deliciously, then Asahi-kun wins. If Asahi-kun succeeds halfway, 'what is this?', 'It tastes weird', &#8212;&#8212;Wait for his expression, it means Asahi-kun lost. What is this alright?... Asahi-kun, come on, &#8220;Ah&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; hateful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was really no different from a trap. Even if Asahi wanted to be patient, Asahi couldn't do anything about this situation. Because she is a senpai who feeds herself. No matter who it was, being fed by someone had to go back to when he was fed by his parents in his childhood. And now senpai is doing this. This is the beautiful "Everyone's Goddess".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi naturally didn't know what kind of expression he was making. But that could be easily deduced from senpai's face. Senpai's cheeks were slightly red, and she smiled twice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey? Asahi-kun, what's wrong with you? It's obvious that the game has started, why aren't you doing anything, blushing and not moving? Come on, 'ah&#8212;' Asahi-kun. Don't you want to be rewarded?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was very unwilling. Obviously he was on guard against Senpai, but he still didn't stop her&#8212;after all, Senpai had never done this before, so from the result, Asahi seemed to have been attacked all of a sudden. Asahi's doubts were completely within that senpai's grasp. ...Is it really good to continue like this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi tightly held her hand on the window sill. He couldn't find any reason. In these two months and days, Asahi had been teased by his senpai. He often said to himself: This kind of thing is nothing. If you retreated here at this time, it would only make that senpai win.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And the so-called &#8220;become an equal relationship with senpai&#8221;&#8212;it was only going further and further.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... can't be like this!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi suppressed his embarrassment and stuck out his face. He couldn't see how senpai was grinning there, so he closed his eyes. At the same time, he let out an ah and opened his mouth. To make a final fight, she also stated that she wasn't shaking - she was the one who bit into the round lollipop herself. Hard touch and great taste...doesn't spread in the mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Uh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi opened his eyes. The lollipop that senpai gave him had disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lollipop arrived and stood across the balcony&#8212;senpai's mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Delicious~"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">senpai muttered, and looked at Asahi who couldn't help but sweat. With a blue cheese lollipop on her lips, the corners lifted slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It is time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi was shocked and made a final protest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Why, se&#8230; senpai is too shameless, I was just planning to eat it&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? But Asahi-kun is really too slow. I'm afraid it will be dawn by then. Judging that you won't be fighting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, you lied, you lied to me. You pulled your hand When I was about to eat it! It must be like this, you are so shameless&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh my God, it seems Asahi-kun is very unsure. It's very strong, looks a bit like you. Then I will treat it as a special service and give you another chance. Okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't pull your hands back while I'm eating!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, I know. Then, come on.... It's, &#8220;Ah&#8212;&#8212;&#8220;."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai stretched out her hand vigorously this time &#8212; the next second, the lollipop touched the corner of Asahi's mouth. This lollipop is still in her&nbsp;mouth now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She did not replace it with a new one, but handed over the previous one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi really froze this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...It took a lot of time for him to understand the situation. The blue flower candy on the white background was wet with saliva, and under the moonlight, it reflected an even more seductive light than before. The candy just melted a little in senpai's mouth. does this still taste like blue cheese? For Asahi, it was more than that. The taste of this candy is senpai's taste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is senpai's mischievous taste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi understood that her cheeks became hot in an instant. The sound of my heart pounding and beating came from my body. He even forgot to open and close his eyelids, and his gaze shifted from the lollipop to the senpai on the opposite side. What kind of expression was Asahi making?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai couldn't contain her&nbsp;excitement, she blushed and looked at Asahi, Asahi's eyes overlapped, and then her&nbsp;body couldn't help but tremble. Her appearance exuded a lewdness that Asahi couldn't explain, and this tightly gripped Asahi's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indirectly kissed the senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you put this lollipop in your mouth, you will definitely turn into a creature that only thinks of Senpai in your head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;...Asahi-kun&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's shoulders couldn't help shaking&#8212;this made the senpai tremble as well. Then next, senpai looked satisfied, and smiled slightly. She slowly pulled her&nbsp;hand back, and Asahi could only watch her&nbsp;do this. The lollipop was in senpai's mouth again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She flicked the lollipop and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is mine. I won without a fight.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You can challenge me again from the windowsill at any time. But the first prize was cancelled. wish"&#8212;&#8212;This good condition is cancelled. Too bad. I'm kind of curious to know what kind of perverted request Asahi-kun will make of me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I, I won't make such a request...!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I I think I can take this opportunity to assess Asahi-kun's sexual interest. Oh, having said that, I won this time. I can make a request to Asahi-kun. that can be realized--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Did you say it before? You said it was just a very small request&#8230; Uh, senpai. What's that smell?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing senpai taking out another lollipop from her pajama pocket, Asahi couldn't help but ask. Senpai said, &#8220;Huh?&#8221; she tilted her&nbsp;head, then popped a lollipop into her&nbsp;mouth&#8212;the sugarless one on the armrest. After that, she opened the new lollipop wrapping paper. Blue floral marble pattern on white background exposed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The senpai answered after putting it in her&nbsp;mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's blue cheese flavor."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Since you have another, let me challenge again a second time with that one&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai smiled happily with a calm expression on her face. ...Like this, she always does tricks like that at the last moment. Asahi was shaking, embarrassed, or nearly fainted&#8212;and Senpai always kept her&nbsp;cool. Asahi never felt that he could beat the senpai in front of him. He never felt that he and his senpai were equal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She was the goddess-senpai that everyone longed for.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is a cute and scary senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Himi Kanako.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, the so-called petty wish from senpai was to take a photo of Asahi wearing a cat ear headband. A photo of a first year high school boy with cat ears held by his senpai &#8212;&#8212; Asahi needs to fight this worry for a period of time from now on, and at the same time continue to live.</span></p><p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Amaharashi Asahi's father and mother have a very good relationship, I am very jealous of Asaho's cousin, Aki once said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Currently, Aki's parents&#8212;namely, Asahi's father's sister and her husband&#8212;are not divorced. Asahi is still in the lower grades of elementary school. After Asahi was said so by Aki Nee-san, she also thought about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;It's true to say that, my parents are indeed very harmonious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aki once said: "The relationship is so good that you can fight." This sentence is clearly a hoax. Better not to fight and talk and laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi sees his father joking with his mother every day, and then his mother will be happy. Even if one of them left the house first, they wouldn't miss a kiss before departure. Therefore, before Asahi heard about the situation of Aki's parents from Aki, he had always felt that this was a very natural, rare and common thing. He doesn't know that some couples have bad relationships.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi once asked his father: Why is the relationship between father and mother so good? Why is the relationship between Aki Nee-san's father and mother bad? His father only answered one sentence at first, "Every family has guidelines." And this sentence did not relieve Asahi. So he continued to dig into the roots. Asahi's father wore a confused expression and agreed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Dad took out an old photo album and showed him a picture of a young woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is your mother"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi sat on his father's lap, staring intently at the photo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't she beautiful? She is also very beautiful now"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi hummed and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Father and mother attended the same high school and the same university. Your mother was an idol in school, and my father really liked mom at that time. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was unrequited love. Parents are similar to us. Aki's mother really likes Dad. Aki. I still remember &#8212; it was really like that until they got married. This isn't a bad thing, it can only be said that Aki's mother worked really hard at that time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Asahi was still an elementary school student, but he could even imagine it. This aspect of Aki's mother is energetic in good ways, but aggressive in bad. Aki nee-san often fights with his mother. Asahi never quarreled with his parents.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe she relaxed after marriage. Aki's mother never tried again to make Aki's father like her. She knew that Aki's father would not deal with other people's harsh attitude, so she insisted on keeping it. About this marriage. I have spoken these words to her. Aki's mother several times..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't that true for Mom and Dad?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's question made his father smile slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Dad was very afraid that my mom didn't like Dad. Mom and dad didn't let her go after they got married. Dad wanted his mom to always like Dad. So dad did a lot of hard work&#8230;.Be it before or after marriage. So Mom and Dad, the relationship isn't that one person was in the former, but the other was the same."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Equal? &#8203;&#8203;Is this important?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's important to be alone in the former and the next.... However, Asahi was born. After that, Father's thoughts changed slightly. Every day with Asahi was precious. Perhaps compared to peers, ordinary days and so- continuously being superimposed this is the most important&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Father lightly touched Asahi's head. Asahi really liked his father touching his head. To be touched gently by a father's strong and strong hand will give you the feeling of being treated as a special treasure. It's like my dad told her&nbsp;: "I love you".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since then, Asahi who has become a high school student, always remembers this conversation between himself and his father. His heart was filled with unbearable anxiety and a feeling of not wanting to admit defeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was because Asahi didn't feel like he was equal to senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai is called "Everyone's Goddess" by everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many reasons for this. The first reason is her charming appearance. Everyone will be taken away by her. The upper and lower eyelids were well defined, and the eyes were slender and delicate&#8212;a refreshing feeling could not help but spontaneously ooze out. The bridge of her&nbsp;nose is straight, her&nbsp;lips are rosy, and her&nbsp;ears are like two smooth shells. Her smooth skin was like white petals wet with morning dew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her graceful figure, her long hair fluttering in the wind, and her model-like sassy steps, with a touch of gentleness in her admiration, gave off a clear and depressing atmosphere. There is a touch of roundness to the slender figure, and the gaze of others is always so gentle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai was born different. She is not only beautiful on the outside, she also looks like a saint in her heart. She is a goddess. It's like a miracle that there is someone like her in the world. Ahhh... senpai. I like you. &#8230; "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi's classmate, Tsubasa Noumachi, who is also a first grader, would often say that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubasa has been working as a local idol since elementary school, she should have met a lot of people who rely on faces for food, including herself. Even so, she was still fascinated by her&nbsp;senpai&#8212;whether it was her&nbsp;appearance or her&nbsp;heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because Tsubasa often spoke loudly about Senpai, Asahi always heard her. It's like this&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's all I heard and witnessed. Helping old people cross the street doesn't count. I helped a stray cat twice, sent a lost child home, or sent him to the police three times... One time, she hugged her. When she was little , the girl peed on her back. Even so, senpai didn't hate her, and smiled to comfort the crying girl&#8230;. That senpai is really an angel&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems it was called the "Holy Woman's Fountain Incident" by the public.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And similar incidents, only Asahi knew about it, there were already countless, whether it was senpai's fellow, senpai's junior, or teacher - no one would speak ill of senpai in secret. Senpai was also very enthusiastic about participating in social volunteer activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why senpai senpai was called &#8220;全民&#8221; (Zen-min, meaning everyone) was because she had told everyone that she had no intention of dating anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--excuse me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi once watched senpai earnestly lower her head. At that time, many cherry blossom petals were still scattered on the ground. The location is at the school gate, and the other party is a sophomore. He is similar to Tsubasa, a famous person in the second school after his senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His name is Tasogare Shimao.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The name is very majestic. But the name suited him very well. He is handsome, over 180 centimeters tall, is good at soccer, can also study, and has many friends&#8212;in one sentence, he is the number one "good guy" in school. Her hair is naturally curly, and this is what makes her cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi didn't know at the time that he was infatuated with the senpai who had raised him for a year after enlisting at night. Since then, he had confessed to his senpai almost ten times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tasogare-san held the letter in his hands and knelt on the ground, but senpai still bowed his head to him. Even though there were a lot of people gathered, it wasn't surprising that everyone was watching the joke. In short, to people other than freshmen, Tasogare-san's acknowledgment in this pretentious display and rejection by senpai had become a constant sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only senpai raised her head, showing a serious expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She looked at Tasogare-san shyly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shimao-kun is very happy to be able to do this. But I don't want to hang out with anyone right now. Sorry. I sometimes ask myself-Will I like someone else?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She stood up as Tasogare-san. Say it at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course, I can! I&#8230; will definitely make Senpai experience a strong love affair!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So. Thank You."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai smiled, and the students around Tasogare-san and the students couldn't help but take a deep breath. Asahi was probably the only one who noticed this&#8212;senpai looked at Asahi for a moment before smiling, and beckoned at her with her eyes. Only Asahi knew that Senpai didn't smile at the people who jeered at Tasogare-san. Asahi had a really great feeling at that moment &#8212; Senpai smiled at Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, she still feels amazing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone's "goddess" why&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">knock&#8212;small stones were thrown at the window and made a sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi stopped writing. Thump, thump, thump - the heart gradually accelerates. He glanced at the animated character's wall clock hanging on the wall. It's 9:17 p.m. right now. ...Time is almost here. Asahi stood up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi first took the chocolate on the table in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I started thinking about what happened last night. While feeding the lollipops last night, Asahi lost his body without a trace. But taking this as a warning, he would take revenge today. As long as Asahi has a weakness, it can only be a dream within a dream to become the same as Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He definitely wanted to embarrass that senpai so she wanted to find a hole to enter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Asahi thought of a battle plan. &#8230;&#8230;Therefore, he didn't expect that the person who prepared the big bomb tonight would be Senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi took out the chocolate from the bag. When he came home from school, he walked briskly to the city center across from his house, and bought this specially. This is a world famous premium chocolate. Even if there were only six chocolates in this bag, it was very expensive for Asahi. But this was to make senpai very embarrassed to find a hole, so Asahi gave it a try.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The thump rang again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi hid the chocolate behind his back, opened the curtain with his left hand, and opened the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His senpai was wearing pajamas and standing on the balcony. She rested her&nbsp;elbow on the armrest, her&nbsp;right hand supported her&nbsp;face, and she looked at Asahi with eyes that shone like little devils. &#8230;This expression is completely different from the senpai in front of the people I saw at school during the day. It even gives people the illusion-are there two people in one body? Which Senpai?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai was actually taller than Asahi. But when she stood face to face through the window, Asahi's line of sight was slightly higher&#8212;this was because the structures of the two houses were different. Asahi looked straight at that senpai and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, do you want to play a game with me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? Yes, but is there a punishment game?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai certainly didn't expect Asahi to say the same thing as last night. But senpai looks very calm. There was frustration in Asahi's heart. Asahi whispered&#8212;'I have a chance to win.'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's a punishment game for serious, right? Of course. If I win, I'll ask Senpai to do something a child could do. What does Senpai want to do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Well&#8230; if Asahi-kun only has one small wish, then I'll win, of course&#8212;I can't ask for too much&#8230; Let me give you an example Do you think it's too much if you hang on the windowsill and do fifty pull-ups?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......to the point that it makes me want to cancel this game."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh. I'm kidding, in Himi Kanako's heart, you are a passionate Asahi-kun, and she doesn't want to. Let me write it down,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">senpai said, but actually didn't do it. But---senpai will remember everything clearly in her heart, so you shouldn't be careless. Asahi would also take Senpai's every expression and every sentence to his heart. This is to find out how to attack senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then&#8230; um&#8230; what do you want to do? &#8230; If I win, I will let Asahi-kun answer a question. How about this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Questions? I don't care.... And I won't lose, senpai must listen to my request. Can the game start now? Three, two, one&#8212;&#8212;'Ah&#8212;&#8212;'."</span><span style="font-size: large;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi stood from the window, squeezed the chocolate with his hands, and reached out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai stared at the chocolate spread before her eyes, then looked at Asahi's fingers, her eyes wide&#8212;she was really surprised. Asahi thought: "How?" At a glance, this is not much different from what senpai did yesterday. But in fact not the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's lollipop has the same meaning as the term, referring to candy with a handheld stick on it. Not so with Asahi chocolate. This chocolate is clamped by Asahi's thumb and index finger. In other words, if Senpai wanted to eat it, she had to touch Asahi's finger with his lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, senpai senpai would definitely hesitate. Maybe that would make her&nbsp;feel like a deer. If this happened, it would be exactly what Asahi had planned. If senpai was shaken so that she would eat her chocolate, she would withdraw her hand at that time. Just like yesterday's senpai-then put chocolate in her&nbsp;mouth, showing a calm expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">--It is time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi dreamed this in his heart&#8212;and before his eyes, Senpai smiled slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, Asahi felt like a carnivore&#8212;not a goddess-senpai. This animal is gentle and beautiful like a cat. Asahi was shocked and froze there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he regained consciousness, he had already missed that opportunity&#8212;Senpai grabbed Asahi's right wrist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai grabbed Asahi's hand and opened her&nbsp;mouth&#8212;&#8212;&#12317;Ah&#8212;&#8212;&#12319;. Then put the chocolate in your mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chocolate- that's not true. To be precise, it should have been the chocolate Asahi was pinching with his thumb and forefinger. Without hesitation, beyond touch-Senpai's face was slightly reddened, her eyes were watching Asahi, and she gently bit Asahi's finger, leaving a faint trace of teeth on Asahi's finger and heart, and took the chocolate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Asahi emptied his brain for a second or two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He just felt his whole body stiff and sweaty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He pulled away from the window and crouched on the spot. &#8212;&#8212;The sound of a fierce blood stream came, and he screamed in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wait a moment! Wait a moment! What is going on, what is going on, why is it like this! too weird! Why was it different from what I expected, and completely beyond my own expectations-why the goddess-senpai, who was considered the most beautiful person in the world by Tsubasa-Himi Kanako-senpai, would be so easy&#8230;, just say it. Put your finger in your mouth. Senpai's hard teeth. The soft touch of senpai's lips. Senpai's breath felt warm. Senpai's saliva slightly touched my finger&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;Asahi-kun"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai's voice came from across the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The voice seemed unbearable, as if suppressing emotions that were about to overflow, and sounded very flat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No...Let me, see your face"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi turned his face away carefully. At that moment, Senpai's expression changed. The red leaf on senpai's flushed face was blown away in an instant, and she covered her cheeks, shaking her body slightly&#8212;her mouth filled with chocolate sweetness. Senpai looked at Asahi's face, ah-ah, and sighed softly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi tried his best to make the only sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, hey, hey.... Asahi-kun, I haven't asked about the specific rules, but I won this game, right? ... It's so sweet. This chocolate must be really sweet. Expensive. Do you think I might eat it?" that and buy it specifically?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yes&#8230; Yes. Uh..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, when Asahi-kun took the confident chocolate, I paid it back I was a little surprised. I thought: Asahi-kun dug a hole for himself again.... But then again, this chocolate is really delicious. What a shame. eat it all, I don't want to chew it. Look."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Senpai took a bite of the chocolate and showed it to Asahi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the chocolate melted a little, it didn't melt as much as Asahi's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In short, just go with the punishment game we agreed on, and I'll give Asahi-kun a question. If you can answer it right away, answer it immediately. I don't mind if you spend more time. But you can't give up until the answer is right. Cheer up. ...Asahi-kun. Amaharashi Asahi-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&#8212;&#8212;So beautiful Senpai, why is it so exciting when we chat by the window?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Immediately after that, those senpais uttered a sentence that made Asahi's doubts explode even more-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">this sentence completely subverted both Asahi's common sense and the world that Asahi lived in until now-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">what is this, why?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I, Himi Kanako will use Amaharashi Asahi for fun because I like Asahi-kun. But why I like Asahi-kun explain why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moon is bright, the clouds are flying, and the stars are shining&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">the night wind caressed senpai's hair and blew her scent to Asahi's side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Like?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi muttered dumbfoundedly - he saw that senpai was staring at his face, trembling again. Senpai's current expression was very coquettish and beautiful --- Asahi couldn't help but feel tense. That senpai seemed to eat something tastier than chocolate, she was a little shy and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seems to add-you heard it right.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...In this way, the Asahi battle officially begins.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order to be equal to each other, important moments that are constantly superimposed, and every day is repeated-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">in this world that only Asahi and senpai knew, far and near, far in the night, on the balcony-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asahi and senpai The distance between them was only slightly more than a meter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And this distance of more than a meter was, to Asahi, imminent, but like the horizon.<span></span></span></p>
