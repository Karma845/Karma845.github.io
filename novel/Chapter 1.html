  <h1>Chapter 1 &#8211; My Sister’s Summer is Too Late</h1>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was summer that I realized that my high school life was almost half-finished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I heard the news from a senior in the club.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, Yusuke. It seems that your sister refused Yamamoto’s confession.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yamamoto….. Oh, that. “</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The first person who comes to mind when I hear Yamamoto. He is a third-year senpai, Taichi Yamamoto.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">He is one of the most popular people in school. No, the most popular among girls. He is handsome, smart, and good at sports. He has a bright future and aims to join a National University, which is also a bonus. He is the target of admiration for girls, and that can’t be compared with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know him that well personally. But I think he’s a really popular guy when I hear such news, even if I don’t want to.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If an event called “Most Desired Boy to Date” is held in this school, it is arguably Yamamoto-senpai, who will end up being the winner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">He is the kind of guy who would be representative of our school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It would be no exaggeration to say that my sister, Akari, is also the most popular school girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even though she is only a first-year student, I am impressed by the fact that she has already established her school reputation. And that she has something to watch out for.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And the matter of Akari and Yamamoto Senpai. Everyone thinks that they are one of the best couples to look at.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As an older brother, if a perfect man like Yamamoto-senpai wants to date my sister, then there would be no reason for me to reject the fact that they would date eventually.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…… But Akari rejected his confessions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">According to my seniors, she refused because there is someone else she likes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Who is he?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">All of them seem to be in doubt, but the truth is hidden deep within the darkness as that person has nothing more to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Haa~h…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What’s wrong? About the sigh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In reality, that person is me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There is no way I can say that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Who else could blame me for sighing?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After all the club activities, I returned home past 7 PM.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I returned after traveling by train, three family members except me were preparing dinner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, you’re back. It was early Today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My mother says while arranging the dishes. I don’t like the fact that it sounds like I’m an overtime office worker. Cut that out already.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m home. I’ve finished all my club activities. So I think I’ll be coming home at around this time for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s great. Then, from now on we’ll eat dinner together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">……I take it back. I was unconscious. Apparently, my remark was a little off the chart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari, help me carry your brother’s dishes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Un, I understand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari responded with a single phrase. As usual, she won’t say more words than necessary.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari has always been a cool girl since she was a kid. She’s a little different from the so-called normal high school girl. She’s not so friendly and doesn’t like to spend time with her friends.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But that’s one of the many reasons why my sister is so popular.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Despite the fact that people look at her like she is some kind of cool object of admiration for both men and women to look like a form of “cool beauty.”&;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Though she is only in the first year, she is already named the most beautiful girl in the school. It’s good.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, from my point of view. When I first heard these, I wondered, “What is cool beauty?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But when I saw her at the school, I can’t help but understand it’s meaning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Itadakimasu!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After a long time, our whole family gathers at the dining table. The laughter heard from the TV feels like BGM(*background music), and every person was eating without having a conversation. In the first place, my parents are not the type to start a conversation, so this became the basics for our table manners.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And, after a while…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Suddenly I felt someone intensely looking at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, When I looked at Akari, she was silently picking up a side dish, and there was no eye contact between us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, maybe it was my imagination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“July 2nd, Thursday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Onii-chan came home earlier than usual.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">From what I heard, it seems that the club’s work was completed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">To be honest, I would like you to quit the club and come home as early as possible. But … Onii-chan enjoys club activities, so I have no choice but to endure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But, I’m still lonely. I wish I could stay with him a little longer….. I think.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">By the way, Onii-chan came home early, so we were able to eat together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Today, I learned cooking from my mom. The meat and potatoes I served for dinner were the side dishes I made…… Did you notice Onii-chan?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">During the meal, I felt that Onii-chan was looking at me, and maybe he noticed it …!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hyaa!…… I love you, Onii-chan♥️”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yes! It wasn’t my fault!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari was conscious of this with all her might, and it seems that she noticed that I looked at her. Yet she intentionally ignored me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was such a daunting joke to say ‘Cool Beauty.’</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“A girl of dignified beauty? What’s dignified?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Even so, Akari, Today you were confessed by Yamamoto-senpai. Right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What happened with being confessed by the most popular boy in the school? You only care for Onii-chan chewing meat and potatoes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, ‘Haaah!’ this line…..”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At this time, Akari is taking a bath, and it’ll last for less than an hour. To be exact, it was about 15 minutes. In the meantime, it is customary for me to sneak into Akari’s room and read the “Onii-chan Note” updated by Akari each day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That’s because, for the past two years, there was not even a single day when Akari didn’t write notes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The timing of writing the notes varies from day by day. Sometimes it’s before taking a bath, and sometimes it’s written before going to bed or after taking a bath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">For this reason, there are days when you can read it. And days when you don’t…… Today is the former.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wonder if she was happy to have a meal with me. After dinner, I hurried back to the room and finally found out. But now, I feel very complicated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">XXXXX</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke, let’s go to the club.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Next day.&;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After the homeroom, someone told me to get ready.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yoshiki? I’ll be there soon, wait for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This is Yoshiki Sakurai. My classmate, clubmate, and friend with a well-defined face and brown hair.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry for the wait.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, you’re finally here. Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We left the classroom and walked to the club room on the 4th floor in the next building. It’s been a year and a half since I joined the club, and it’s an important daily routine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“By the way, have you heard the news yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah … about Akari? I heard from my senior yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, I’m surprised by the fact that Yamamoto Senpai confessed, but even more I’m surprised to see that there are some people who can refuse Yamamoto’s confession.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, it’s Akari-Chan……and, he adds that while showing a surprised expression. However, his speech was rather light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That must be the case. And after that, he said;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, it doesn’t matter because you’re a hated big brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yoshiki makes fun of me and starts laughing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yes, he knows we’re on bad terms, so he just wants to mess around with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">He’s always like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I agree. Your right!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Our flow of conversations ends here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Thank you for your hard work “</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I opened the door of the club room, I saw a girl sitting on the chair. As soon as she saw us coming, she shifts her gaze from her notebook and looks at us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, both of you have finally arrived.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… It’s only you Nanami?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s right, our seniors have supplementary lessons …. By the way, did you hear that? About Akari-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami grinned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That story…….. Akari is like a celebrity.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, she’s so cute. That’s why nobody wants to neglect this topic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami House, my childhood friend, smiled and muttered. I’ve known her since she was a child. We are in the same second year of high school, in the same class, and the same club.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her house is in the neighborhood, and our parents are on good terms. That is the reason why we are good friends.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We are of the same age. We have been together since childhood. It doesn’t change whether we become elementary or junior high students… Finally, we took the same high school exam.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I think that childhood friends of the opposite sex are naturally separated during puberty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In our case, it’s different, we also have the same club, and we will go to the same college in the future. I sometimes think that our workplace will also be the same until employment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">……Well, the reason is that in all of those times, Nanami invited me to join whether it’s this high school or the club.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, by the way, Yusuke, do you have plans when the club activities are over today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Today? I have no plans.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, then…. Would you like to go out for dinner, together? It’s going to be late since the club activities are over … See, tomorrow is a holiday, right?”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/d7hYzw2/031-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Dinner? Maybe it’s okay once in a while.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Really? I’m glad!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As soon as I agree, she smiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What is the dish you wanted to eat so much…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If so, then let’s invite Yoshiki as well? After the club activities are over, I think Yoshiki can join us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It must be a good dinner, and I think it’s better to have many people.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I made a suggestion with that in mind. But when Nanami heard that, she frowns.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm … I had that thought that Yusuke would say that …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She muttered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Eh, did I say something strange?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After the club activities, Nanami looks sullen, and Yoshiki, who also has a complicated expression, squeezes pasta for two hours. Finally, I returned home past ten o’clock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s funny, where did I make the wrong choice….?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm … I’m tired today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I finished the bath and went inside my room, I grumbled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even though I was sitting at the shop all the time, it felt mentally exhausting probably because I was concerned about Nanami, who was in a bad mood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then I spent a lot of time without doing anything and picked up my smartphone for no particular reason.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yes, there was nothing else I had wanted to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Internet surfing is just one of Akari’s hobbies that she can do in her room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s been two years since I started reading Akari’s notebook.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I read the notebooks written every day, I learned that a surveillance camera was set up in this room, and a microphone was installed recently. Akari, who has nothing to do with school life, occasionally talks about me. I learned a lot by observing from a distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I haven’t done anything to this day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Rather, I don’t even know what to do, but it might be the correct answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m sure if I tell our parents, they will do something about it. I can’t predict what will happen in the end, but I’ll be able to stay away from Akari for the time being. I shouldn’t have to keep up with it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I just can’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If I do that, I’m sure everyone will have a hard time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Mom, dad, and Akari.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m scared, after all. I am afraid that a few words would destroy my everyday life.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I’m not a bad person, and I don’t care, but … I wonder why, after all, that courage doesn’t come out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have no choice but to endure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Let’s be patient until one day Akari changes her mind and realizes the mistake of what she is doing. That was my conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">For that reason, there is a limit to what I can do in this room because of the surveillance camera.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m also an adolescent boy. I want to see one or two of those erotic videos.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, if you think that Akari actively monitors all the activities, I do in this room…Yes, it’s awful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I can’t do that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Are you awake, Akari?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was hovering over my smartphone when I heard my mother’s voice from behind the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She’s not here for me but Akari.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While listening to the conversation through the door, it seems that she came for Akari to ask for a bath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Time is… Eleven o’clock? Yeah, at this time, I guess she had already written the note.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Following my mother’s footsteps, the door of the next room closes, and I can hear the sound of footsteps going downstairs. I’ll wait a little bit just in case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, let’s go and check Today’s notes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Smiling at my dexterity, I touched the drawer as usual.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…… Then I noticed that there was an unfamiliar notebook placed inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“PLAN”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">One word is written on the cover.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The only notebook I always read is “Onii-chan Note.” I don’t remember seeing this one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Plan……? Perhaps…….”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I didn’t recognize this notebook, but it caught my attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I read Akari’s “Onii-Chan Note,” I remembered that sometimes it says “for plan” or “plan is going well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At that time, I was ignoring it. I thought it’s about something stupid, but perhaps this notebook contains detailed information about the “PLAN.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Un, well, let’s read this……”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I picked up the notebook and placed it on the desk, and opened it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was the familiar handwriting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">【PLAN】</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">A strong heart is essential for the success of this Plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If you feel like you’re about to fail, read this note and remember the perfect future you think of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“All right, you can do it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What is this? A message to your future self?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It is interesting, but I don’t have the time to read it further. I turned to the next page.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">【GOAL】</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Lock up Onii-chan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">【Why is it necessary?】</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Lock up Onii-chan so that he can’t live without me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…… Akari said something absurd!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What should I do?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4">1) Ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">2) Ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">3) Ignore it… As if I could!</p>
