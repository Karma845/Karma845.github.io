<h2>Chapter 1: It’s a Matter of Taking Her, or Taking the World</h2>

<p>The large semi-circular classroom was split in two.</p>
<p>On the right side facing towards the blackboard is the Absolute Empire, and on the left side is the student from the Republic of Blaze sitting —— no, standing up.</p>
<p>There’s about 30 people each. Both sides were prepared to attack with swords or magic at any time.</p>
<p>In the critical situation, tension stretched.</p>
<p>One of Blaze&#8217;s students —— a young man with vivid red hair opens fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Princess-sama of the Empire. You aristocrat guys has stopped putting on airs, but you can&#8217;t do anything by yourself. Ultimately, you can’t rely on us, and I wonder if you could prevent the Northern Demons(Mazoku)*.&#8221; <em>(TN: I’m still wondering of what name is good for it, mazoku or demons??)</em></p>

<p>He has a brazen look, and sharp and war-like eyes.</p>
<p>The dignified high-quality uniform, was slovenly wore by him.</p>
<p>Leading magician of the Republic of Blaze, Haruto Shindou raises his chin with his hands in the pockets of his pants, and glared with his eyes as if looking down on the other party.</p>
<p>At the end of such line of sight of his, was a girl who boasts a transcendental beauty.</p>

<p>—— Iris Shylveene</p>
<p>The first princess of the Absolute Empire, and successor to the throne. A genuine princess.</p>
<p>Sparkling silver hair, with blue eyes. Her figure, is so beautiful that she can be mistaken for an ice fairy. Her glossy pink lips open, and a bell-like voice plays.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aristocrats hold an excellent pedigree. Intelligence, magic power, everything. In order for the excellent individual to lead the inferiors, what’s the strange there?” <em>(TN: By the way, she’s speaking befitting for a royal aristocrat. I’ll to make her sound as a royal)</em></p>
<p>“Hah, I say there’s a quite. You’re singing your own praises too much.”</p>
<p>&#8220;People have roles that suit their abilities. Like the Blaze Republic, if you guys only give priority to fairness, a disaster will occur in which an incompetent person becomes a leader. It’s nothing but a foolish move of driving the nation to deathbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Such words, I&#8217;ll return it as it is. Aristrocra~ats, are just resting on one&#8217;s laurels* for hereditary succession. Most of you guys are incompetent.&#8221; <em>(TN: ‘to be satisfied with one’s achievements and not to make an effort to do anything else’, pretty insulting if you ask me)</em></p>

<p>In those words, except for Iris, the other absolute students changed their complexions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that!? Plebeian who knows nothing of etiquette!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there’s no threat of the Northern Demons/<em>Mazoku</em> (Tempest), Blaze and the others would’ve been attacked and destroyed immediately!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Foul inferior people! Get out of this school!!&#8221;</p>

<p>At such stream of insults, Haruto sneers.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-82763234' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-82763234' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>“And yet, the noble-sama hangers-on, are cowering back with only their mouths. If you don&#8217;t have the courage to kill this me, then don&#8217;t look foolishly big, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Interesting! That dull face of yours, I’ll thrash it using my sword!!”</p>

<p>The Absolute students, pulled out their swords all at once.</p>
<p>Even so, Haruto does not stop his attitude of fueling them. With his hands still stuck in his pockets.</p>
<p>Even if the other party is a magician studying at this academy. Only those who have been recognized for their swords and magic talents in their own country are here. Haruto&#8217;s attitude is quite reckless.</p>
<p>A single student goes forward, bringing the tip of his sword closer to Haruto&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong!? Why don&#8217;t you pull out your sword!? You scared!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Haruto has plenty of composure.</p>
<p>To that degree, he has great confidence in his own power that he will never lag behind. It overwhelmed the opponent.</p>

<p>“Tedious talk is fine. Do it quickly. However, don&#8217;t forget that it&#8217;s the Blaze&#8217;s greatest magician who you pointed your sword towards, you know? If you miss the first hit &#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;ll die? &#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Kuh………… This commoner!&#8221;</p>

<p>While saying so, he reasonably backs off.</p>
<p>When they saw it, the Blaze students behind Hart burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“Oy oy, what was that! You lack of nerve!”</p>
<p>&#8220;That is why a shelter-raised young master is! Hyahahahahaha!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re so inclined, we could throw down the Absolute Empire, and subdue the Northern Demon (Tempest) with that momentum! <em>Koraa</em>!!”</p>

<p>Listening to such exchanges with a troubled face, was Elric Elan-sensei. In front of the blackboard, he was standing as if he had been left behind.</p>

<p>“Ah you guys? Pretty much right now, we’re in class, but……”</p>

<p>But no one is listening.</p>
<p>To the kind of refreshing handsome teacher with blond hair, sweat flows drop-by-drop.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p>&#8220;Ah &#8230;&#8230; it’s needless to say, but the world is now on the verge of destruction. A herd of demons which appeared from the north —— the Northern Demons(Tempest) are invading the continent. We all know, that this same thing happened a long time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reaction from the students, but Elric-sensei manly continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;——A sign of the resurrection of the Demon King&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris and Haruto&#8217;s faces move with a twitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even now, many people are being killed by the demons near the border. No, outbreaks of demons are occurring frequently even in the inland area. This is exactly the sign that the Demon King is about to be resurrected. Therefore, it&#8217;s not the time for human beings to fight with each other. That is the reason why this Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy was established. Understood?”</p>

<p>That was a sound argument.</p>
<p>Certainly for such reasons, this school was established this year. Training magicians to fight the demons, it was for such purpose.</p>
<p>The Absolute Empire and the Blaze Republic have been in conflict repeatedly until then, but they have agreed for a temporary ceasefire. As a result, the cooperation structure of all four countries that govern the continent has been established, and finally, this spring, the first-year students, Haruto and the others, entered the school.</p>
<p>But until then, Blaze and Absolute have unfolded fight as if washing blood with blood.</p>
<p>Under the same roof, they couldn’t study together peacefully as expected.</p>
<p>Much less to say, Iris, the imperial princess, is being verbally abused face-to-face too much. As an Absolute, she can&#8217;t just put her sword in silence.</p>
<p>Iris pushes away the Absolute students from the back and stares intently</p>

<p>“Hang down”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->

</div>


<p>Then she coldly told, and instead she came out in front.</p>
<p>The Blaze students fall completely silent.</p>
<p>No one can get rid of the rumors about Iris.</p>
<p>In just one hour, she regained the fortress that was robbed by the Northern Demons (Tempest), and annihilated the Knights of Blaze with a hundred people by herself, but such heroic story is no longer a legend.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, only Haruto, has a fearless smile on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the, is the princess personally going to be my opponent? I&#8217;m so honored that I can&#8217;t help but laugh wryly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The temperature in the classroom dropped sharply, and glittering things glistened around Iris.</p>
<p>The cold air released by Iris, freezes the moisture in the air.</p>

<p>“Don’t make light of me Haruto Shindo. Absolute&#8217;s throne is a testimony of strength. If you&#8217;re not strong, you can&#8217;t stand at the top. To me who is the leading magician of Absolute, do you think you can win?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;……<em>Fuun</em>&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Haruto put his hands out of his pocket.</p>
<p>In his right hand, he grasps a handle of a sword. As he raises his hand as it is, a sword with red blade then appeared from his pocket.</p>
<p>A sword in the shape of a flame ——— the inscription is 『Phoenix』.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s beloved sword, and partner. It is a magic sword specialized in fire magic.</p>
<p>Such a long thing, can never be stored in a trouser pocket, etc. However, their uniforms woven with magic skill formulas, make that absurdity possible.</p>
<p>Iris also, from her coat pocket, pulled out a sword which couldn&#8217;t be stowed there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a blue sword that contrasts with Haruto.</p>
<p>Like an ice crystal, it’s a magic sword with a splendid appearance. The inscription is 『Streptopelia*』. <em>(TN: Streptopelia &#8211; </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptopelia"><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptopelia</em></a><em>)</em></p>
<p>Golden magic characters shine on the thin transparent blade, and the cold air that Iris wears becomes stronger.</p>
<p>To counter the ice that hangs in the air, Haruto scattered around sparks. Probably due to the magic of Blaze&#8217;s flames effect, the flames run through the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go! Princess of the empire!!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Come! Commoner&#8217;s sword!!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two people close the gap in an instant ——at that moment,</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“That’s enough! 『Restrain』!!”</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.io/pHOK9nx_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="" width="482" height="685" /></p>

<p>Elric-sensei&#8217;s Restriction magic 『Restrain』 was activated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nah!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!?&#8221;</p>

<p>A string that came out of nowhere, entwines both of their arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please calm down! This is a classroom, you know. Come apart——”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>They would be separated</em> —— everyone in the classroom thought that.</p>
<p>But, it became the opposite of such.</p>

<p>“Uwaaaah!?”</p>
<p>“Kyaaahh!?”</p>

<p>The strings pulled towards each other.</p>

<p>“Hey, shi…… uh!?&#8221;</p>

<p>What’s more, due to poor position, Haruto&#8217;s face was pressed against Iris&#8217; chest.</p>
<p>In other words,</p>
<p>In the cleavage of Iris&#8217; wealthy boobs, he buried his face. <em>(TN: LOL, nice!!)</em></p>
<p>And then the string with the floating magic characters, ties up Haruto and Iris&#8217; bodies like a single piece of luggage.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s hand, was fixedly grabbing Iris&#8217; ass.</p>

<p>“Hi!?”</p>

<p>Iris involuntarily raised a scream a little at the ascending sensation running up her spine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Iris’ leg, has wedge itself in the gap between Haruto’s crotch. On Iris’ thighs, the feel of an unknown object that does not exist in her was transmitted. <em>(TN: I wonder what it is?)</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Thi,this is …&#8230; kyaah!?&#8221;</p>

<p>They entangle themselves together, and Haruto falls to the floor while being caught underneath. Iris&#8217; weight was put on him, and the feeling of pressure that wraps around his face got strong.</p>
<p><em>It,it’s soft!? Mo,moreover, it smells good……</em></p>
<p>Making him forget even the situation he’s in, it was a cushion that ruins a man.</p>
<p>But he can&#8217;t breathe.</p>
<p>He moved his hand to see if he could pull the string off, but he just massaged Iris&#8217; ass.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Hi &#8230;&#8230; n,no …&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris seemed to have lost her reason, too, as she whispers so.</p>
<p><em>No, no way &#8230;&#8230; everyone is watching &#8230;&#8230; i,it feels good &#8230;&#8230; </em><em>❤</em><em> ah, no matter what happens &#8230;&#8230; </em><em>❤</em></p>
<p>Her consciousness that is likely to be dragged down by temptation, was stopped by the yelling of a female student.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, teacher Elric”</p>

<p>The one who shouted, was a student wearing a maid outfit for some reason.</p>
<p>Francette Balladur—— As a maid-cum-overseer attached to Iris, she is a girl who serves as the Deputy head of Absolute.</p>
<p>Growing up as a maid of Iris from an early age, she has, stronger thoughts for Iris than anyone else. She gazes at Elric-sensei as if she were looking at his parents&#8217; enemies.</p>

<p>&#8220;It made me think that you were an eloquent lineage, but in fact you were a perverted teacher!! By the way, being a member of the Hero’s Guild, was it also an outright lie!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha,what are you talking about, Francette-kun!? That’s not true! I’m a member of the Hero’s guild! The academy president guarantees my identity! I’m not a pervert!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why don&#8217;t you undo the magic quickly!!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Tha,that’s right!!”</p>

<p>When Elric-sensei, panics and casts a release spell, the strings that bound the two of them disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you okay!? Princess-sama!”</p>

<p>When she hugged Iris as if to pull her off Haruto, Francett crawls her gaze into Iris’ body for any injuries. Other than her slightly reddish cheeks, there was no particular change.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be no problem with your appearance, but&#8230;&#8230; princess-sama, how are you feeling?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ye,yes. I’m okay…… no problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris regained her usual icy look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really? Are there any abnormalities in your body? Are you feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>“As I said, I’m fine. You’re too worried, Francette”</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p>When she stood up, she loosened her mouth slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But princess, the princess who has no immunity to men at all, had her voluptuous breast covered his face, and in addition, he ruthlessly rubbed your ass. That you’ll surely possess a big wound in your heart, Francette was very worried.”</p>
<p>&#8220;A,as I said, I&#8217;m fine &#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t remind me too much, Francette&#8221;</p>

<p>The redness of her cheeks that she once drew back, comes back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, the princess&#8217; huge breasts, was distorted by the shape of that accursed Haruto Shindou&#8217;s face, and it was displayed the change of its form with <em>Muniyu muniyu*</em>, so I can&#8217;t help but worry.&#8221; <em>(TN: the sound of breast being groped)</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I,it’s enough already, Francette. I beg you, please stop”</p>

<p>Francette&#8217;s breathing somehow gets rough, and her look changes.</p>

<p>“Moreover, the fingers of the man who encroached your ass! It was like representing the tenderness of the flesh in Princess-sama&#8217;s ass! As if devouring its feeling, he was squeezing it! Ah, it’s fluffy tenderness, he must have enjoyed it’s elasticity pushing his fingers back! The body of the princess on a pervert&#8217;s poisonous fang is ——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it already, Francette!! You&#8217;re much more perverted!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris, whose face turned bright red, finally couldn&#8217;t stand it and yelled at her.</p>
<p>To these two, Elric-sensei apologized while scratching his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry. I didn’t think this would happen &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No &#8230;&#8230; sensei wouldn&#8217;t do something like that intentionally. Let&#8217;s forget about this matter anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that said, Elric-sensei also relaxed his shoulders as if he was relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m really sorry. But it&#8217;s strange …&#8230; this restriction magic has never failed hundreds of times against the demons(mazuko)&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s impossible &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>Iris, pressed her lips with her fingertips as if to stop herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah no…&#8230; such, there&#8217;s a proverb that wizards also crash their spells, and any sort of skilled magician, can make a mistake…&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say so, then you saved me. Haruto-kun, I’m also so——&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto was being surrounded by the Blaze male students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geez. We’re in trouble because our head is being indiscriminate.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man of delicate features with soft brown hair and wearing under-rim glasses, smile intimately at him.</p>

<p>“Shuddup, Claude. You have seen it right. It was an accident.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. However, can you be more careful? I dared to ignore the situation before and after, you intertwined* with the princess of the empire, and&#8230;&#8230; if you pull out only that part, there is a possibility that it’ll be communicated like that.&#8221; <em>(TN: Intertwined here can also mean, you know? (</em><em>～</em><em>o</em><em>￣</em><em>3</em><em>￣</em><em>)</em><em>～)</em></p>

<p>Unlike Haruto, he has attached a hook to the top of his collar, and cleanly wore his uniform stylishly. With intellectual and compose demeanor, he has a somewhat noble atmosphere, even though it was just a play.</p>
<p>He’s the Blaze&#8217;s Deputy Chief and advisor, Claude Konoe.</p>
<p>He’s the most trusted friend of Haruto, and right-hand man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Claude, what do you want to say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a disaster if rumors spread that Haruto and the princess of Absolute were in love —— or something like that, you know. It&#8217;s an unthinkable scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>“——tsu!”</p>

<p>Haruto screwed his face as hard as he could.</p>

<p>“……Don&#8217;t say creepy things. Rather than that, it&#8217;s your job to wipe my ass, right? Stop properly these guys from speaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, he looked around the surrounding Blaze students. Then one of them,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re going to make and spread such a rumor, you know, but Haruto…… let me ask you something instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto frowns his eyes in displeasure.</p>

<p>“&#8230;&#8230; What did it feel like? The royal boobs.&#8221; <em>(TN: That’s what I want to know, too!!)</em></p>
<p>“Nah!?”</p>

<p>Like a breaking dam, the other boys rushed to Haruto.</p>

<p>“Indeed! Was it soft!? Was it hard!? What is it!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As expected, the princess&#8217; boobs, was it really soft and fluffy!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;d rather know how it feels!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yo,you guys! Stop bullshitting me. How it feels, is it——”</p>

<p>As if Haruto remembers its feeling, he stares at his fingers——,</p>

<p>&#8220;That’s &#8230;&#8230; you &#8230;&#8230; this——uhh!?”</p>

<p>He noticed that Iris, whose cheeks were blushing, was staring at him with moist eyes.</p>
<p>To hide his hands, Haruto, folded his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, I don&#8217;t know that! I felt it separately, but I didn&#8217;t touch it!!&#8221;</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>In contrast to the grinning boys, the Blaze female students had a clear hostility towards Iris.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is, that woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she planning to set up a honey trap on my Hart?&#8221;</p>
<p>“The Absolute’s cold-blooded woman, was using her amorous glance to Haruto…… I seriously can’t forgive her.”</p>

<p>Francette replies immediately.</p>

<p>“That’s rude! To think that only the men there fell for the Princess-sama!? Princess-sama is the crystallization of beauty, unlike with a meager body like yours! You have an unscrupulous inferiority complex, didn’t you!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She’s tempting Haruto as I thought!! And what’s with the meager body!?&#8221;</p>

<p>The issues are also messed up, and the students who swear each other, didn&#8217;t know what they were arguing about. However, their purpose is to curse the other party.</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p>“Ahh!! Geez, you bastards, that’s enough!!”</p>

<p>Haruto shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won’t be deceived by such a woman! I&#8217;m not interested in that one either, and I&#8217;m not agitated!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; icy expression remains the same. However, her eyes became sharp a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, to deal against a mountain monkey like you, am not a charitable person enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>Hart comes out in front again, and glares at Iris.</p>
<p>However, Iris without drawing a step, glared back.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you’re not willing to fight the Northern Demons (Tempest), I can first occupy Blaze, and force you to obey, you know?&#8221;</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-87317230' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-87317230' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>&#8220;Interesting. Can you do it, Bastard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two people&#8217;s gaze scatter sparks.</p>
<p>Elric-sensei holds his head, and mutters like he’s given up a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already&#8230;&#8230; out of my control, good grief…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>And the students in the room, were filled with bloodlust again.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217; upturned blue eyes, was staring fixedly at Haruto.</p>

<p>“With the Northern Demons (Tempest), <em>are you prepared to fight them</em>? Haruto Shindou&#8221;</p>

<p>During that time ——Haruto noticed something all of a sudden. As if being in a hurry, he looked back on his Blaze companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be vigilant, you guys! The Northern Demons (Tempest) is coming!!&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>Being an abrupt thing, the Blaze students stared at Haruto with absentminded faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah? What are you talking about, Haruto. This place is at the central, isn’t this? Where the four countries are adjacent to it, it’s in the middle of the continent, ain’t it? Aren’t those at northern border?&#8221;</p>

<p>The ground rumbled.</p>
<p>Along with the rumbling of the ground, a faint vibration is transmitted to them from the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shit! They appeared!?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Haruto looked at his surroundings with vigilant, the walls on the corridor side blew off.</p>
<p><em>——!?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Kyaaaaaaaaaahh!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uoohh!?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p>A student that was swallowed up at it fell to the floor, and screams rose with a momentary delay.</p>
<p>Then, when they saw the thing which broke through the wall, and entered the classroom, a second shriek rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230; Northern Demons (Tempest)!?&#8221;</p>

<p>At first glance, it looks like a person. However, its whole-body skin is bluish-green. It has no pupil and iris on its eyes, and its exposed teeth are fangs like that of carnivores. On its head were thorn-like horns. Its body is larger than humans, and the muscles of its whole body are abnormally developed.</p>
<p>——Danger level 5 Ogre.</p>
<p>In the forest near the north, human remains eaten by Ogres, are often discovered.</p>
<p>It has been taught since childhood, that Northern demon (Tempest) is reasonably intelligent and dangerous. In the minds of the students, the human figure which was mercilessly eaten revives.</p>

<p>“Kiyaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!?”</p>

<p>The girls&#8217; screams rang out, and the classroom fell into panic.</p>
<p>Although they are excellent students, they have no experience in combat. In the appearance of the Northern Demon (Tempest) who suddenly popped out, it was no wonder that they lost sight of themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whe,where did it came from!? Why is it inside the classroom of the academy!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Elric-sensei which can&#8217;t get his head around the events suddenly, can&#8217;t cope. He simply shouted in a restless voice.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, there was more than one Ogre.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Two more creatures continued to break through the door, and enter the classroom.</p>
<p>The passageway side is now sealed by the Ogres, and there is no escape. If there is only one option, they have no choice but to jump out of the window.</p>
<p>However, this place is the fourth floor. The students who can’t use material moving magic 『Movement』, need to be prepared for death.</p>
<p>Be eaten by the Ogres, or fall to death —— such choices, drive the students into the depths of despair.</p>
<p>—— But,</p>
<p>In the classroom smelled with the scent of death, there were two calm students.</p>

<p>“……this time, it’s Ogre hah.”</p>

<p>When Haruto murmured without interest, while carrying a sword on his shoulder, he walked defenselessly towards the Ogre.</p>
<p>After coming to its place, Elric-sensei finally regained his composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll deal with it, so step back——&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at the same time that Elric-sensei tried to release Restriction magic, that the Ogre attacked Haruto. Leg strength far exceeding that of humans, the Ogre&#8217;s body flew right in front of Haruto in an instant.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“『Flame』!”</p>

<p>He brandished the flame.</p>
<p>Hart seemed to calmly, wave his sword casually.</p>
<p>The flames draw the trajectory of the sword.</p>
<p>The next moment, the Ogre was directly divided into two.</p>
<p>Its corpse flies in the air, and when it is engulfed in flames, it becomes ashes in an instant.</p>
<p>The skeleton remains as charcoal, but it also shatters when it falls to the floor.</p>
<p>One of the remaining two of three, further attacks Haruto.</p>
<p>His sword shines red, and raises sparks.</p>
<p><em>—— </em><em>Flame.</em></p>
<p>It was Fire magic.</p>
<p>It’s Blaze&#8217;s most prided flame system magic.</p>
<p>Its power is weak, but it doesn’t need long incantations, and easy to invoke. By letting the sword be dwelled in the magic, the fire magic is directly struck at the moment he slashes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>When Haruto wields his sword lightly, a more intense flame depicts the trajectory of the sword.</p>
<p>Instead of jumping straight, it inserts a slight feint, and kicks the floor. It&#8217;s faster than the previous Ogre. It’s sharp claws, slashed Haruto.</p>
<p>That’s what it seemed.</p>
<p>However, Haruto dodged such a blow without difficulty, and swung his sword.</p>
<p>The body of the Ogre that jumped, before landing, was split into two.</p>
<p>Around its torso, it was separated up and down.</p>
<p>Its two split bodies while being wrapped in flames, roll on the floor.</p>
<p>There was no time for it to raise death throes at the end. Its corpse becomes charcoal, leaving no bones.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>The remaining Ogre is the largest of the three, and it was robust.</p>
<p>That one, swoop down on Iris.</p>
<p>Iris as well, put her fingertips on her sword.</p>

<p>“『Frost』”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>That&#8217;s like the ice version of Flame.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217;s sword, Streptopelia glows blue, and scatters white ice crystals.</p>
<p>Absolute is specialized at ice-based magic. Her sword becomes extremely cold, lowering the temperature of the air and producing white smoke and glittering particles.</p>
<p>Iris fends off the attacking Ogre with graceful movements as if she was dancing. When it was wondering if it would move to counterattack from here ——,</p>
<p>She had already slashed the Ogre.</p>
<p>The Ogre’s body freezes. Frosting it from its feet to hips, chest, arms, and head, stopping its movements, and ceasing its life.</p>
<p>When Iris quietly approached the ice statue of Ogre, with the tip of her sword, she stabbed it lightly.</p>
<p>The Ogre, which turned into an ice statue, crumbled down. They don&#8217;t even comprehend that it was an Ogre anymore. All that remains, is just a pile of smashed ice.</p>
<p>The students were stuffing their breath, and staring at the stream of sequences.</p>
<p>And after a few seconds,</p>
<p>In the quiet classroom,</p>
<p>The crackling applause and cheers resounded.</p>

<p>“It was incredible, Harutooooo!! As expected of Blaze&#8217;s leading magician!! You’re the strongest!!”</p>
<p>“Iris-samaaaaaaa! Just like an ice fairy! She’s beyond magnificent!!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>The excited students were shouting, and they couldn&#8217;t hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun! Iris-san! Are you alright!?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Elric-sensei ran up to them, he stared anxiously at the two’s bodies.</p>

<p>“Alright is it….. what’s that?”</p>

<p>When Haruto asked a question in return with his sword in his pocket, Elric-sensei shrugged his shoulders in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t even have to ask&#8230;&#8230; I feel regretful. Rightfully, I had to respond with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Eris store her sword, she shook her head.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Since it was a sudden thing. It&#8217;s no wonder you were surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah &#8230;&#8230; nevertheless, you two were calm, and really amazing. As expected of the sole head magicians who carry their countries on their backs. Also, looking at the current coordination between you two, I was convinced that the establishment of this school wasn’t wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>To Haruto’s sharp glare,</p>

<p>&#8220;That’s because, it was a wonderful coordination, wasn&#8217;t it. Your each other’s breath is exact.”</p>
<p>“Haa!? In what place do you mean! Something like breath, it isn’t match at all! Besides, don&#8217;t put us head magicians together! This girl, got it by her social position! I got it with my own strength, you know!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris also displeasurely frowns her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sensei, please don&#8217;t say anything unpleasant. Being treated in the same rank as Blaze in itself, is an insult to us.”</p>
<p>“Eh……uhmm”</p>

<p>With cold sweats pouring, when Elric- sensei stepped back, this time Haruti and Iris glared at each other.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;To use flames inside the classroom, are you a pyromaniac? Your thought is too shallow. In such a case, far from protecting the people, it will involve unrelated individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah? Don&#8217;t be a sore loser. I defeated two, you one. That means I&#8217;m twice, as strong as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one I defeated was the largest. Thank you for your hard work on taking care of the small fries. In that sense, it helped me a little. Are you happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Bi……b*************tch!”</p>

<p>Haruto touches the handle of his sword again, and Iris also draws out her sword.</p>

<p>“Now now! Anyway, thanks to you guys, the school was protected. On behalf of the teachers, I thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric-sensei floated a tense smile, while breaking in between the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than that, we have to find out why the Ogres appeared! Now, everybody go out into the corridor! I&#8217;m going to start the investigation!”</p>

<p>Iris touches the hair ornament on her head, then wraps her hair around her fingertips, and brushes it smooth.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Haruto Shindou, I won&#8217;t get tired of dropping you from the top of the clock tower 21 times. That face, how happy would I be if I didn&#8217;t look at it for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Interesting eh. If you hate me, then I do too. I&#8217;ll pay my respect to that face again, so be prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, you should already stop fighting!! Please!!&#8221;</p>

<p>With Elric-sensei appealing in tears, the two left the classroom with their faces <em>humphed </em>as they turn away at each other.</p>
<p>Afterwards—— as a result of examining the area around the school building, it was found out there are traces that it was dug up from the ground, and that there was no doubt that the Ogres appeared from that place.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been confirmed that orcs and ogres originate from the soil.</p>
<p>However, there is no precedence that appeared from the site of the academy.</p>
<p>The invasion of the Northern Demon (Tempest), and the resurrection of the Demon King are approaching as a reality. Both the teachers, and students felt that fact first-hand.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy is a dormitory boarding system.</p>
<p>Dormitory buildings are not for one, but are divided by country. That is, because of consideration to prevent pointless disputes.</p>
<p>After dinner is over, each of them spends their free time until the lights are turned off.</p>
<p>Inside the dormitory of the Republic of Blaze, everyone was gathered in the hall. Even if it was said everyone, only thirty people are there. This year&#8217;s students are only first-year students, and there are no senior or junior students.</p>

<p>“Well but, I was surprised at today&#8217;s Ogre.&#8221;</p>
<p>“That’s true. However, we’ve escaped harm since Haruto defeated it.”</p>

<p>Haruto separated himself from everyone&#8217;s circle, and was lying on a three-seat sofa by the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, we can&#8217;t just rely on Haruto at all. Everyone needs to level up, and show that Blaze is the strongest.&#8221;</p>

<p>At such times, it is Claude, the deputy chief, who manages the conversation.</p>
<p>Claude with a gentle look behind his glasses, was astutely observing everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;This academy is the touchstone for the four-country alliance, the Republic of Blaze, the Absolute Empire, the Luminous Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Horizon. The balance of power here is, no exaggeration to say that it will be an alliance of power dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this &#8230;&#8230; we guys, are pretty serious about responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct. That’s why the other countries —— specially the Absolutes, they need to be crushed. And we have that power. That’s true, right? Haruto&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto, who was thrown with the conversation, rose up with a tiresome smell, and came to everyone’s place.</p>

<p>“That’s obvious. At first, I thought it was a joke since we were at the same school as the other countries, but this is a good opportunity.”</p>

<p>Smiling fearlessly, he looks around the Blaze students.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, you guys! Blaze is the strongest! Show Absolute, Luminous, and Horizon that we are the supreme ruler of the continent!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a few words from Haruto, everyone&#8217;s tension jumps up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oooooooooooouuuhh!! Let’s do it!”</p>
<p>&#8220;I am! The head!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What their ancestors have done to us, let’s double and give it back!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he saw that everyone was getting excited, Claude was once again convinced.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Haruto is a person who should stand on top of people.</p>
<p>As a team, it’s important to be among the best of the four countries, but there are more important things than that.</p>
<p>That is, Haruto, the head magician, being the strongest in the academy.</p>
<p>The head magician is the representative and figurehead of the country.</p>
<p>The strongest, can&#8217;t afford to lose to the leader of other countries. Not to mention, such as lagging behind Absolute, which it shouldn’t be.</p>
<p><em>——I,</em></p>
<p><em>Will definitely make Haruto win.</em></p>
<p>While Claude was thinking about such a thing, Haruto turned his back on everyone, and about to leave the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going? Haruto&#8221;</p>
<p>“—— Somehow, I&#8217;m sleepy. I&#8217;m going to go to bed. Then, see you tomorrow, you guys”</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wah eh hey, Haruto “</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you played a very active part today, you must be tired. Good night, Haruto.&#8221;</p>

<p>While being sent with greetings from the other students, Haruto left the room.</p>
<p>He heads down at the dark stairs to his room.</p>
<p>While walking in the darkness, Haruto&#8217;s eyes were glowing with determination.</p>

<p>“……My bad. Claude&#8221;</p>

<p>Like that, he leaked while standing alone.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>The large moon was shining in the night sky.</p>
<p>The moonlight flashes on the surface of the lake, the city of water —— Grandia emerged from it.</p>
<p>At the center of this, is the Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy.</p>
<p>It was originally a small island on a large lake. A large church was built hundreds of years ago there, and a town was developed to surround it.</p>
<p>This is the only place where the four countries are adjacent to each other.</p>
<p>It’s a key point of transportation and trade, and many people gathered and it became too narrow in no time. Then the people decided to extend the town by piling up the lake and building an artificial land on it.</p>
<p>Now it has grown many times the size of the original island, and it became one of the leading cities on the continent.</p>
<p>The church that first triggered it, was used as the Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy of sorcery. On the large site, that looks like an old church, many elaborately decorated school buildings were lined up.</p>
<p>The one that stands out among them is, the clock tower that can be called its symbol.</p>
<p>It’s the tallest building in Gran Magia, with a large clock which faces on all side, and it can be seen from anywhere on the island.</p>
<p>The hands of the clock have pointed, to twenty-one o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>On the top floor of the clock tower —— there was Haruto who was supposed to be sleeping inside his room.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>With his arms folded, leaning against the wall and looking out the window.</p>
<p>Haruto is in the room exactly inside the clock. All around the walls, huge dials were shining. Since it is made up of special ore, the dial itself is emitting light. Therefore, the inside of the room is slightly bright even if there is no light.</p>
<p>In the dim light, huge gears are moving regularly. The inside of the room, is crammed with mechanisms for moving the clock.</p>
<p>And there is a big bell overhead. Even by the number of times this bell rings, he can check the time.</p>
<p>Provided, however, that it will not ring until morning after 20:00, to inform the dormitory of the curfew.</p>
<p>The time of the curfew, has already passed.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no other students, and no one will come.</p>
<p>That should be.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>

<p>“Are you there, Haruto Shindou?&#8221;</p>

<p>——A girl showed up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I come to think deeply that there is no one&#8230;&#8230; good grief, it’s the worst”</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-58051811' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-58051811' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s no one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto walked away from the wall, and took, a step closer to Iris. His eyes, hands, and whole body are full of tension.</p>

<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Really&#8230;&#8230; just the two of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I also checked if there was anyone hiding or lurking. I also confirmed that there was no magic or magic tool that eavesdrops on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……For real”</p>

<p>Iris stepped her foot out,</p>
<p>She gradually sprints,</p>
<p>And then she accelerates,</p>
<p>To attack at once——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun ♡&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>She jumped into the chest of her loved one. <em>(TN: Maybe they should rename this one as ‘My cold girlfriend is sweet only to me’?)</em></p>

<p>&#8220;O,oi, Iris&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto looked down at the top of Iris’ head as she leaped to him. And when he was confused as to whether it was okay to put his hand on her back, he stiffened in a half-baked posture.</p>
<p>To Iris&#8217; bold action, Haruto was a little overwhelmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You noticed the signal properly&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m happy.”</p>

<p>It’s the gesture Iris made during their daytime parting.</p>
<p>—— After touching the hair ornament attached to her head, she wraps her hair around her fingertips, and brushes.</p>
<p>That’s the signal.</p>
<p>And after that, specify the place and time to meet.</p>

<p>『Haruto Shindou, I won&#8217;t get tired of dropping you from the top of the clock tower 21 times. That face, how happy would I be if I didn&#8217;t look at it for the rest of my life. 』</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>In this case, the number 21 specifies the time. The clock tower after that is the place designation.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s reply to that was,</p>

<p>『……Interesting eh. If you hate me, then I do too. I&#8217;ll pay my respect to that face again, so be prepared. 』</p>

<p><em>That is, OK. I’ll go see you</em>—— it means that.</p>
<p>And with his beloved girlfriend coming, Haruto was waiting here restlessly.</p>
<p>The expectations that they will meet soon, anxiety that one may not be able to come due to trouble, fear that they may be found out and, the tension of the two of them being alone.</p>
<p>After overcoming them, the two finally met alone. There is the joy which can’t be said.</p>
<p>Haruto gently, put his hand on Iris&#8217; waist.</p>
<p>His lover&#8217;s body that fits in his arm, is unreliably slender, and supple, and even if he just put his hand on her back and hugged her, it brought the ultimate pleasure to Haruto.</p>
<p>However ——,</p>
<p>While holding Iris&#8217; body with one hand, Haruto pulls his sword out of his pocket with his other hand.</p>
<p>The two are longtime enemies.</p>
<p>Continent supreme ruler, princess of the Absolute Empire and a head magician, Iris Shylveene.</p>
<p>The other male, the lead magician of the Republic of Blaze, Haruto Shindou.</p>
<p>These two people who are absolutely incompatible, who would believe they were actually lovers?</p>
<p>However, if it’s known, it’ll be the largest scandal on the continent.</p>
<p>There’ll be no future for them.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>Therefore, this relationship cannot be known to anyone.</p>
<p>Haruto raises his sword, and coldly swings its tip down.</p>
<p>Behind Iris, two enormous bats were approaching.</p>
<p>Level 2 Murciélago* —— it’s three to five times the size of a normal bat. A carnivorous northern demon (Tempest) that attacks people and animals. <em>(TN: Spanish for &#8220;Bat&#8221; &#8211; </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murci%C3%A9lago"><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murci%C3%A9lago</em></a><em>)</em></p>
<p>When he contacts with Iris at night, it often appears. Those Murciélagos, turned into ashes with a short agonies of death voice.</p>
<p>When she noticed that Haruto had defeated the Murcielagos, as Iris suddenly returned to herself,</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah &#8230;&#8230; tsu!? I, unintentionally……tu!”</p>

<p>Dying her cheeks, she leaves Haruto in a hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>

<p>With a voice that seemed to disappear, she muttered. The appearance of her entwining her fingertips in both hands, is also cute.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“N,no. Don&#8217;t worry, about that”</p>

<p>He becomes a little embarrassed, and Haruto returns it in a slightly brusque tone.</p>
<p>Seeing the remains of Murcielagos, which was slightly scattered from Haruto&#8217;s sword, Iris anxiously clouded her face.</p>

<p>“……As I thought, us having a relationship, it’s difficult, isn’t it”</p>

<p>She sadly looked down.</p>

<p>“Hey……wait”</p>

<p>When Haruto reaches for Iris, as if to escape from that hand, Iris descends back in an elegant manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Absolute. Haruto-kun is Blaze&#8230;&#8230; With that alone, we can&#8217;t be together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Moreover, Iris is a princess. In exchange, I&#8217;m simply a student.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>Unlike the Absolute Empire, where aristocrats reign as rulers, there is no social division in the Republic of Blaze.</p>
<p>In the past, Blaze was also originally belonged to Absolute. In Absolute’s perspective, Blaze is just one region where the commoners live.</p>
<p>It is now a de facto independent country, but it&#8217;s not as enthralling to the Absolute. Therefore, there is a constant conflict between the two countries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto is not simply a student. Are you not the leading magician of Blaze.”</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just that my sword and magic skill stood up. That’s why, to have my relationship with Iris be recognized, it’s not going to happen.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree…… in addition, there’s a more troubling problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p>Enemy countries.</p>
<p>Both, are leading magicians of each country.</p>
<p>In addition, she is the princess who would succeed her country and he’s the best in his nation.</p>
<p>This is more than enough as an obstacle.</p>
<p>However, there’s still more.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>The ultimate problem, is in front of them —— No, standing in the way at the front of the whole world.</p>
<p>Haruto grabbed Iris’ hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230; Haruto-kun. If you do that——&#8221;</p>

<p>Around the two, a ball of light appears with a shrill whistling sound.</p>
<p>The monster of light, Will-o-wisp.</p>
<p>At danger level 1, its threat is not that great. However, since it is a monster of light, it appears everywhere.</p>
<p>Haruto almost unconsciously, swung his sword.</p>
<p>Without screaming, the orange color sphere that glows dimly, divided into two and disappeared.</p>

<p>“……After all, we are cursed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris gently draws her hand to herself, and have Haruto&#8217;s hand separate from her arm.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Iris&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They felt the sign that the Demon King will be resurrected &#8230;&#8230;. the Northern Demon (Tempest) is pleased. &#8221;</p>

<p>Staring at the sparks and ashes that came down, Iris had a serious expression on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The curse of the 『Half body of the Demon King (Juliet) 』 that dwells inside this body —— to the fulfillment of the reincarnation wedding (necromance) &#8221;</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>To the undeniable facts, Haruto was speechless.</p>
<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris, the Demon King&#8217;s half body lurks inside their bodies.</p>
<p>It was half of the Demon king, which is described as the 『Juliet』 in the ancient magic book.</p>
<p>The Demon king had divided his existence, and had hidden inside mankind.</p>
<p>And then, they were waiting for his time of resurrection.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>What is the method of his resurrection?</p>
<p>It’s that if his half-split body, unites into one.</p>

<p>“At the time, I with Iris——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah …&#8230; we can&#8217;t do ecchi* things until the end &#8230;&#8230;&#8221; <em>(TN: LOL ecchi – indecent, or you know)</em></p>

<p><em>Regretfully, hou &#8230;&#8230;</em>then, Iris breathed a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>To her unexpectedly assertive remarks, Haruto involuntarily silenced up. From the mouth of such a transcendental beautiful girl, simply saying such words, he became so excited that his head got dizzy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when Iris suddenly noticed the meaning of his silence,</p>

<p>“Eh!? Yo,you mean that?”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>She turned bright red and became flustered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mou…… that was immodest &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>

<p>To Iris, who holds her cheeks and looks down, Haruto hurriedly follows.</p>

<p>&#8220;N,no, I&#8217;m the one who’s sorry&#8221;</p>
<p>“Besides, there is also Haruto-kun&#8217;s feelings. My body may somehow, not be that attractive &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve decided that you’re attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Eh, </em>then Iris raised her face, and stared at Haruto with her moist eyes,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m happy&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, he heard a mosquito crying-like voice.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>With that being too cute, Haruto received a shock as if he had been hit hard in the head.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>I want to hug her.</em></p>
<p><em>Right now.</em></p>

<p>Such an urge, was firmly suppressed by Haruto.</p>
<p>He must restrain himself from heedless behavior.</p>
<p>That’s because,</p>

<p>——The destruction of the world, depends on whether the two are H or not.</p>

<p>Resurrection of the Demon King.</p>
<p>It, means the destruction of all humankind.</p>
<p>In the inscription of the Grove Stone, which is said to be historic ruins of the mythical period,</p>

<p>——Throw everything, and prevent his resurrection.</p>

<p>It is written like that.</p>
<p>And even in the ancient documents of the era after that,</p>

<p>——Do not let the Demon King be revived.</p>
<p>——Once resurrected, all living things will become corpses, and the world will collapse.</p>

<p>Then, it has been written many times, and the history of humankind over the past few thousand years, can be seen that it was also a battle of how to prevent the revival of the Demon King.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether if it’s a correct history or a legend, but it was said that the Demon King has been revived once in the past. At that time, it was told that they were able to defeat him before he completely awakened.</p>
<p>But then, there is the terrifying description that more than half of all humanity has died.</p>
<p>And, this was also written.</p>

<p>——Before the Demon King is resurrected, there will always be a large number of Demons.</p>

<p>In fact, if they do something that is indicative of H*, such as Haruto and Iris hugging each other, a demon appears. <em>(TN: ecchi!!)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps they see the contact between Haruto and Iris as a sign of the resurrection of the Demon King, and the demon were brimming with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether to destroy the world, or save it—— Speaking of that, it sounds fine, but &#8230;&#8230; that is to do H, or not &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The seriousness of the problem, and its gap at the object is too intense.</p>

<p>“Tha,that’s correct…… The fate of the world depends on our relationship &#8230;&#8230; Without it, about this time, more ——&#8221;</p>
<p>“Nn?”</p>
<p>&#8220;No-!? No! It’s nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris shyly, looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;A,anyway &#8230;&#8230; If we flirt too much, it&#8217;ll be dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. That&#8217;s how, the world will get closer to collapse.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>That said, what timing should be good to do H with her?</em> The fate of the world being decided by such a story, he wondered about it.</p>
<p>However, as a fact, since Haruto and Iris entered the academy, the invasion of the demons from the north has intensified. The Northern Demons (Tempest) are also, feeling the resurrection of the Demon King.</p>
<p><em>That’s why, I won’t flirt with Iris.</em> That’s what he thought, but ——,</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but the Demon King&#8217;s half body in us, draw us to each other. It&#8217;s like an instinct. Even if we try to endure, it&#8217;s quite difficult.”</p>
<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t mean, we can be as clingy as a normal couple! When we flirt, that alone, would destroy the world——”</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, why did you hug me a little while ago &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ugh! Tha,that’s……”</p>

<p>Iris had a trouble making excuses.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I saw Haruto-kun&#8217;s face, I became happy&#8230;&#8230; I somehow couldn&#8217;t endure it &#8230;&#8230; as I noticed it, I was jumping&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Tu!!”</p>

<p>If she says such a thing, he will be happy. Now it was Haruto&#8217;s turn, to fight the urge to hug Iris.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; so am I. However, that is the curse of the 『Half Body of the Demon King (Juliet) 』, the trap for the Reincarnation wedding (necromance).&#8221;</p>

<p>——Reincarnation Wedding (Necromance).</p>

<p>It’s the curse of the Demon King.</p>
<p>The Demon King&#8217;s half body, stimulates the hosts Haruto and Iris from the inside, trying to make them want to do H(ecchi).</p>
<p>The power of that curse is tremendous; falling them sometimes into an aphrodisiac state.</p>
<p>It’s like a sudden sexual excitement cycle has turned up.</p>
<p>Even more surprising, is that the Reincarnation wedding (necromance) also interferes with physical phenomena.</p>
<p>It causes miraculous mishap, and making the two have an H(ecchi) accident.</p>
<p>In fact, today too——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s Elric-sensei&#8217;s Restraint Magic&#8230;&#8230; that too failed, because of the reincarnation wedding (necromance).&#8221;</p>
<p>“……I guess so. Reincarnation wedding (necromance) creates absurd accidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it’s the case …&#8230; as I thought, I and Haruto-kun, shouldn’t meet anymore——”</p>

<p>As if to block Iris&#8217; words, Haruto says.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that”</p>
<p>“Eh? So, in order to escape from the reincarnation wedding (necromance), the only way to save the world is, for us to break up &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tears build up in Iris&#8217; eyes.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>“Stop bullsh*tting me!!&#8221;</p>

<p>To Haruto, who suddenly shouted, Iris&#8217; body jumped with a start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we, have to be the sacrifice for the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Bu,but……”</p>
<p>&#8220;I won’t give up now. Running away like that. I won’t lose to that handed down destiny!”</p>
<p>“…… However, what are we going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>“That’s right, I&#8217;ve been with Iris all along. And not ruining the world eh. I won’t let the world be destroyed in which I and Iris live!&#8221;</p>
<p>“……What will we do?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m going to think about it after this!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s …&#8230; do you really think you can do it?&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p>Iris&#8217; eyes, who asked a question, are searching for salvation.</p>
<p>Haruto laughed fearlessly.</p>

<p>“Easy peasy”</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufufu &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What&#8217;s funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>“No, what you said was unrealistic​, but…… somehow, it really feels like that one way or another”</p>

<p>After he says that, Iris wiped away her tears with her fingertips.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Mou</em>. Because you said something interesting, I laughed so much that I cried.&#8221;</p>

<p>A whole face smile.</p>
<p>Iris&#8217; smiling face, which can never be seen at the academy ordinarily.</p>
<p>Underneath her icy face, such an undecorated expression was there.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-39451737' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-39451737' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>Knowing that, is one of the reasons why Haruto loved Iris.</p>
<p>They, fell in love with each other at first sight.</p>
<p>At first, he was just confused by that feeling.</p>
<p>However, there was an opportunity for the two of them to fight as rivals, and in that, they learned about the existence of the Demon King&#8217;s half body inside each other.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Talking with their own real intention, it’s the reason why they got to know each other very well.</p>
<p>After that, an unexpected side of them became clear one after another.</p>
<p>Even though she is a princess, she evaluates people regardless of their status.</p>
<p>She hates lying and deceiving people.</p>
<p>When she sees soldiers killed in action, she hid and shed tears.</p>
<p>Entering the dormitory was her first experience of going out of the castle for a long time, so she couldn&#8217;t enjoy sleeping the night of that.</p>
<p>She loves sweet things.</p>
<p>On one time, she wanted to choose her own clothes.</p>
<p>Like a normal girl, she wants to do some shopping.</p>
<p>Her icy expression is just apparent, and she’s really expressive.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>Her cold attitude is just to maintain dignity, and she’s really kind.</p>
<p>Boundlessly.</p>
<p>Haruto himself, does not know whether his love at first sight, was due to love, or the Reincarnation wedding (Necromance).</p>
<p>However, such a thing doesn’t matter to him now.</p>
<p>Because he really likes the Iris right now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; I have to go back soon&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking up at the clock on the wall, Iris murmured a little lonely.</p>
<p>It’s reversed because she’s seeing it from the inside, but the hands of the clock were about to point at 22 o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time for the patrolmen to come.</p>
<p>If they got discovered, it will be variously troublesome. Their brief time of rendezvous is also, about to end.</p>

<p>“……it seems like that”</p>

</div>

<p>Haruto went to the side of the locked window.</p>
<p>When he puts his hand on the window handle —— suddenly, a gust of wind blew in.</p>

<p>“Kyah……!”</p>
<p>“Iris?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the flustered voice of Iris, Haruto looks back.</p>

<p>“Tu!?”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; skirt is greatly turned up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,don’t! Look &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris hurriedly bent forward, and held down her skirt with both hands.</p>
<p>As a result, her form became sticking out her butt to her behind.</p>
<p>At her back, is the gear that operates the clock.</p>
<p>To such a gear, the highest-class underwear that wraps Iris&#8217; ass was caught. Not wedging into her skin, it was a marvelous timing that it only rolls up the thin fabrics like it was pecking it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hya!?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It pulled Iris&#8217; lower body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oy!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto kicks the floor and runs up to Iris, grabbing Iris&#8217; hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull you!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Wa,wait”</p>

<p>Iris stared at Haruto with an at her wits end look.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong!?&#8221;</p>

<p>The force of the gears is strong, and Iris’ body is pulled.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“It,it’ll slip off…….”</p>
<p>“You’re saying that in this situationnnnn!!”</p>

<p>Haruto pulled Iris&#8217; arm with all his might.</p>
<p>A white cloth sliding down from Iris’ thighs, and slipping out of her toes could be seen.</p>

<p>“Uwah!?”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; body suddenly becomes lighter, and Haruto falls back with too much momentum.</p>

<p>“Kyaaaaahh!?”</p>

<p>And in the form of being half thrown, Iris straddles on Haruto&#8217;s chest.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“……tu!?!!”</p>

<p>A dozen centimeters in front of Haruto’s eyes, was Iris’ lower body.</p>
<p>There’s nothing under her skirt.</p>
<p>He saw her lovely navel, and the surprisingly white lower abdomen.</p>
<p>And ——,</p>
<p>Before he lowers his gaze, her skirt came down softly, and the confidential scene came to an end.</p>

<p>“Ha……ha,haa……”</p>

<p>Iris, who turned bright red up to her ears, was quivering repeatedly.</p>
<p>Haruto is at this moment,</p>
<p><em>——Ah, the world, was one step closer to ruin.</em></p>
<p>He thought. <em>(TN: LOL!! Safe!)</em></p>
<p>The Demon king’s half-body causes such a miraculous accident, the so-called lucky lewdness*. <em>(TN: or lucky pervert)</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Suddenly, a little girl&#8217;s voice resounded.</p>
<p><em>Shit!? We were seen!!</em></p>
<p><em>The girl who was holding a golden shining staff, was looking down at us.</em></p>

<p>The qualification for admission to the academy is fifteen years old, but Clara was specially admitted. That’s, the proof that her ability towers above the rest.</p>
<p>Haruto clicked his tongue in his heart.</p>
<p><em>This girl was patrolling tonight huh. Also, it’s a troublesome guy &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.io/Cm360ER_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="" /></p>

<p>“Ah, you guys are, Blaze&#8217;s Haruto and Absolute&#8217;s Iris!? Late at night like this&#8230;&#8230; in such a place, what indecent things are you doing nodesu!? Go,God&#8217;s punishment will rain down to you, y’know!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she couldn&#8217;t look straight at them, Clara turned away, and waved the cross-shaped staff she was holding in her hand, as if to dissipate an evil spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo,you’re wrong Clara! We are killing each other!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Although it’s too late, Haruto and Iris pulled out their swords, and they put the blade of their swords on each other&#8217;s necks.</p>

<p>“Eh……?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Clara turned her eyes towards the two people.</p>

<p>“What the heck. Was that so desu?  Then there’s no proble——&#8221;</p>

<p>Her smiling face, turns into a perplexed expression again.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a big problem!! Quickly put your swords back, and stand up desu!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris stood up, paying attention to the hem of her skirt, and Haruto also, while trying not to look inside Iris&#8217;s skirt as much as possible, stood up.</p>
<p>When they stood up, they look down on Clara.</p>
<p>However, Clara put her hand on the scale as if saying &#8220;I&#8217;m angry.&#8221;, which showed off on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for the lights to turn off, and you can&#8217;t have a duel in a place like this, desu!&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>Usually, he’ll have a quarreling play a bit more with Iris in this place. However, there are some pressing issues right now.</p>
<p>Iris is wearing no underwear.</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s obediently follow here</em>—— So Haruto judged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I understand. For today, I’ll put up with Clara’s dignity, and drew back”</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuun&#8230;&#8230; a bit more then I would’ve reached my limit …&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, while being cool, Iris holds the hem of her skirt firmly.</p>
<p>In addition, she doesn’t seem to be worried, that the wind may blow from the window again.</p>

<p>“Anyway, we&#8217;re going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait desu. For these two bad people who went out late at night like this, I would like to tell a thankful story from the Luminous scriptures nodesu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara, while holding her cane, joined the fingers of both her hands together, then she smiled like an angel.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>&#8220;N,no &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll refrain from that&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uh…… me too”</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, just listen to me nodesu. I&#8217;m sure your hearts will feel purified, and you won&#8217;t have a quarrel nodesu. Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll show you around the cathedral on the campus desu.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara is the leading magician of the Luminous religion, and is declared as both a saint, and an angel of light. She is dedicated to the Luminous religion, both physically and mentally, and it was said that the Pope has also put his eyes on her.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of that, if there is a chance, she will try to propagate her religion.</p>

<p>“Well…… as I said”</p>
<p>&#8220;The day after tomorrow, we will go through the procedure for joining the religion nodesu.&#8221;</p>

<p>She’s supposed to be a soft and fluffy character, but she’s strangely pushy only when she does missionary work.</p>

<p>“Come now, let&#8217;s pray together &#8230;&#8230; Lux*.” <em>(TN: Latin for light, also, a unit of illumination)</em></p>

<p>Lux is a Luminous prayer word, which seems to mean 『light』.</p>
<p>Haruto was fed up with Clara&#8217;s missionary offense, but right now, Iris is in an even more of a dilemma.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s not there.</p>
<p>She has no panties.</p>
<p>Moreover, her uniform is a split miniskirt.</p>
<p>If the wind blows, she will die in one shot. <em>(TN: Not literally, but figuratively)</em></p>

<p>&#8220;A,anyway, I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, please wait nodesu!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignoring the voice thrown on his back, he tried to open the door to the stairs. However, when the handle is almost reachable—— the door opened unauthorizedly.</p>

<p>“Ta-dah! Adelina-chan won&#8217;t let you go!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-67434110' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-67434110' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>The door opened, and a bustling girl jumped in.</p>
<p>With a pink twin tail, and a big smile on her face.</p>
<p>And huge breasts.</p>
<p><em>She has an open jacket, is it because her chest doesn’t fit with it? </em>Like that, it makes him wonder.</p>
<p>The head magician of the Kingdom of Horizon, Adelina Earthland.</p>
<p>Haruto looks up to the heavens in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Sh*t! An even more troublesome girl is here!</em></p>
<p>The leading magicians from four countries have all lined-up.</p>
<p>Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy, is a school established by these four countries. It was a strange story that their four representatives, for some reason, late at night, meet in such a place.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here? Adelina&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oops Haruto-san. To tell the truth, I picked up a lost item some time ago underneath <em>suyu</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then saying that, she showed him what she had in her hand.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>“……Uh!?”</p>
<p>“……Tsu!!!!”</p>

<p>It was Iris&#8217; panties.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I picked it up, it was still warm~. So, I&#8217;m sure that it was just taken off~.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying that, Adelina, spread Iris&#8217; panties out like making a string figure, and showed it to everyone.</p>
<p>Iris was biting her lips, and shaking her shoulders.</p>
<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; Why!?</em></p>
<p><em>Why should I, be humiliated like this!?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“A’re? What&#8217;s wrong, Iris-san? Are you not feeling well~?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N,no…… Be,being shown off with the underwear of another person, I’m just uncomfortable&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><em>Tha,that&#8217;s right.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s okay.</em></p>
<p><em>Unless that underwear was expose to be mine! </em></p>

<p>Clara turned her cheeks red, and stared at the underwear that Adelina spread.</p>

<p>“Ju,just taken off…… Wh,why, such a thing &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fu, Fu, Fu, base on Adelina-chan&#8217;s deduction, I&#8217;m sure that there are people in trouble for dropping their panties on this clock tower, without doubt desu!&#8221;</p>
<p>“I,it’s preposterous nodesu! It&#8217;s shameless nodesu! God&#8217;s punishment will come down nodesu!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara, who turned bright red, agitatedly talk on and on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s most likely an illicit sexual relationship nodesu! It’s ecchi nodesu! It’s child-making nodesu! Dirty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O,oi, Clara?&#8221;</p>

<p>To Clara who was turning her eyes round and round, and excitedly rattling on and on, Haruto was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>“This is that nodesu. Extremely impudent, I’m sure they were doing something like that nodesu! It&#8217;s the perverseness of going out in front of people without wearing underwear and getting excited nodesu!&#8221; <em>(TN: This is a saint? LOL)</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><em>Why do you know such a play!? Weren&#8217;t you a saint!?</em></p>
<p>Then, Haruto suppressed his feelings which was like a quip.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Iris, in every word of Clara from earlier, was being relentlessly stabbed in the chest.</p>

<p>“Wha~t’s wrong? Iris-san? Somehow, you have teary eyes, but~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230; it’s no…&#8230; thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>“You sure~? If you feel sick and need something, please tell me! I carry around a lot of medicine, snacks, and so on!&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Adelina, from her jacket pocket, showed the medicine bottles, and cookie boxes to her one after another.</p>
<p><em>She didn&#8217;t seem to have much doubt about Iris’ suspicious point of behavior. </em>Haruto secretly stroked his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather than that, this is a perverted situation nodesu! In the sacred academy, it’s a serious matter nodesu!”</p>

<p>Adelina, broadly smiled and turned to face Clara.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Ahaha, calm down~ Clara-chan. It&#8217;s the opposite desuyo~.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t calm down nodesu! I have to start exorcising the fiend right away nodesu!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Clara-chan. I think it&#8217;s too rash to think so~. This, could be an accident!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh…… what do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>To the puzzled Clara, Adelina bends her chest with a self-satisfied look. Thanks to that, her big boobs bounced up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe her underwear was most likely caught in the gears of the watch or something, wasn’t it!? So, she must have unavoidably taken off her panties to escape the difficulty, for certain! Great detective Adelina-chan thought so!&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Are you a simpleton! </em></p>
<p>Like that, Haruto was full with quip-like feelings, but he couldn&#8217;t say anything because that was the truth.</p>
<p>Clara who sparkles her eyes,</p>

<p>“That’s a great deduction nodesu!”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>praises her.</p>
<p>Haruto was bewildered.</p>
<p><em>Are these the top magicians of each of the four countries that make up the Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy?</em></p>
<p><em>Without a doubt, they’re just fools. A group of idiots. </em></p>
<p>He involuntarily wanted to hold his head.</p>
<p>However, because her reasoning that seems to be stupid is true, his worries were doubled.</p>

<p>“Tha~t’s wh~y…… its panties check!!”</p>
<p>“““Ha!?”””</p>
<p>“Now then, everyone should show their pants, right?”</p>
<p>“……wait, don&#8217;t say that as if it’s a matter of course!! What are you thinking, you b*tch!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelina raises her index finger, and shook it in front of his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most likely among us; I, for certain, think that the owner of these panties must be here. So, whether you were wearing panties or not, it’ll be obvious if we check it!!” <em>(TN: By the way, she’s speaking like a detective in her lines here.)</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Wha…..”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; complexion paled ghastly.</p>

<p>“Tha,that’s …… uhmm……”</p>

<p>And Clara, as if she’s in trouble, was tightly grasping her uniform.</p>
<p>Haruto was thinking doubtfully about her state, but he immediately reconsidered it.</p>
<p><em>She was urging the saint called the Angel of Light to show her panties, so I guess she was troubled huh. Or rather, this Adelina fella, she’s gonna be killed by the Luminous devotees, isn’t she?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s go from Harurun first~.&#8221;</p>
<p>“——wait, me is it!?”</p>
<p>“Tha~t’s right~? Because there are times when it is called a <em>hobby</em>, isn’t it~.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that stupid!? You!!&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><em>I’m not a Luminous devotee, but I wanna kill this girl!!</em></p>
<p><em>What the hell even is Harurun, that she said!? And, I have some quips to ask!!</em></p>

<p>&#8220;And then, next is Iris-chan, and Clara-chan, right~? If you run away, that means you’re wearing no panties!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris and Clara, quiver their shoulders with a start.</p>
<p><em>Not good.</em></p>
<p><em>I have to stop her here!!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Wa,wait, Adelina. Think about it! You, are pressing a schoolboy to show you their pants!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have~ to be afraid, you know~? I’ll be gentle~” <em>(TN: Nice ( ͡• ͜ʖ ͡• ))</em></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, at that moment ——,</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>There was a roaring sound of a violent explosion outside.</p>
<p>Haruto rushed over to the window, and looked out.</p>

<p>“That’s……!?”</p>

<p>The courtyard enclosed by the school building bulges like a mountain.</p>
<p>The ground that is getting taller and taller, eventually transforms into a huge humanoid figure. Its height easily exceeds ten meters.</p>

<p>“……Golem huh”</p>

<p>A monster born from the mass of earth, a Golem.</p>
<p>Its danger level is 9. Although it is composed of soil, it’s an enemy that cannot be underestimated. Its physical attack that is unleashed from its huge body and mass, cannot be countered by a human being’s flesh and blood. It was said, that a single blow of it can crush a house and city walls.</p>
<p>And, in actuality——,</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>When the Golem&#8217;s arm swung down towards the school building, the school building was crushed entirely like the model of it. The Golem&#8217;s powerful arm crushed the roof, and it sank into the third floor and onto the second floor.</p>
<p>And when it shook its arm, the school building bursts like an explosion.</p>

<p>“Uwah~! It astoundingly came forth!! Why did such a monster, show up at the school!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“I,it’s a disaster nodesu! It’s more terrible than the perversion nodesu!!”</p>

<p>It was natural for the two to be flustered.</p>
<p>After all, its body is made up of soil that is hardened like a stone, and neither swords nor arrows can pass through it. And magic is also difficult to affect the Golem&#8217;s body. Its magic resistance is not that great, but its robust body is also potent against magic. And above all, even if it is destroyed, it will restore itself immediately with its regeneration ability.</p>
<p>So to speak, it&#8217;s like a rampart approaching with magic defense.</p>
<p>A Golem, is a fortress that moves on its own feet.</p>
<p><em>However, at the reincarnation wedding (necromance) which was mentioned earlier, Iris——&#8230;&#8230; Anyway, it might have been reasonable considering what had happened.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, there was something like a flash in Haruto&#8217;s head.</p>
<p><em>This is rather, a great chance to escape from this predicament!</em></p>
<p>Haruto quickly pulls out his sword, and shouts to Adelina and Clara.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>&#8220;I will subdue the golem! You guys protect the other students!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, he made an eye contact with Iris.</p>
<p>Detecting Haruto&#8217;s intention, Iris was the first to jump onto the window sill. Holding down her skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go first.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, she leaped into the night sky.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll head out too!”</p>

<p>Haruto also jumps out of the window.</p>
<p>Gliding through the night sky, they head to the Northern Demon (Tempest).</p>
<p>Looking in front, from under the fluttering of Iris’ skirt, he could see her white butt.</p>

<p><em>After this, while protecting Iris&#8217; skirt, I have to defeat a strong enemy at Level 9 huh.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>With that in his mind, Haruto had a headache.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>It was not long since they entered the academy.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris were undergoing training inside a Dungeon.</p>
<p>Taking a ship from Grandia to the Horizon side, it was in the site of a mine about 30 minutes away by horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>It was decided to make a pair by way of lottery, and dove into the dungeon, but …… more than that, it was between enemy countries, moreover, their leading magicians; they would have to make a pair.</p>
<p>Looking back at it now, this may also have been due to the reincarnation wedding (necromance), but the two at that time didn&#8217;t understand that.</p>
<p>The dungeon’s interior, was a pitch-black limestone cave. The area around the two, was slightly illuminated by a magical light. Ordinary stalactites are milky white, but this cave is blue. It was highly transparent, as though it was a maze made up of blue gems. The blue cave illuminated by the magic light, was very beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Don&#8217;t pull my leg, don&#8217;t you. Ohime-sama”</p>
<p>“You, don’t be a hindrance to me, plebeian”</p>

<p>Despite taking a cold attitude, Iris&#8217; chest was throbbing <em>dokidoki</em>.</p>
<p><em>Wha,what does this mean? It&#8217;s so dark, and narrow &#8230;&#8230; In a little romantic place, it’s just the two of us……</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><em>——Actually, it was love at first sight.</em></p>
<p>Her mouth speaks ill of him, and her face shows off a cold expression. However, ever since the entrance ceremony, her head was always full of Haruto.</p>
<p>Thinking calmly, she knew that she was not the kind of person that can have a romantic relationship with. However, she was thinking about it arbitrarily rather than reason. Her eyes chased after his figure.</p>
<p><em>No good, Iris. I&#8217;m just a little deluded. The other party is the Blaze&#8217;s lead magician. Even now, he should be aiming to kill me if there is a chance. I need to be careful!</em></p>
<p>Like that, it was what Iris is telling to herself at that time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Haruto was<em>——</em></p>
<p><em>Damn, this is dangerous, Looking closer, she’s insanely beautiful, ain’t she. Is she really, the same person as us &#8230;&#8230; She’s so cute that it looks a lie.</em></p>
<p><em>——Actually, I fell in love at first sight.</em></p>
<p><em>At the entrance ceremony, I was thinking of giving her a blow. The Absolute&#8217;s head magician who I heard from the rumors, I was wondering if I should kill her to the degree that she wouldn&#8217;t die. (TN: What? What does he mean?)</em></p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>The moment he saw Iris for the first time, his heart was captivated.</p>
<p>However, the other party was part of the Absolute royal family and its leading magician. The symbol of the one he hates.</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t be deceived by her appearance. They don&#8217;t think of us as the same human beings. They only think of us as resources or livestocks for management and exploitation!</em></p>
<p>Every time Iris came to his mind, Haruto told himself so.</p>

<p>“What happened!?”</p>

<p>When he turned around, Iris&#8217; foothold suddenly collapsed. The ground behind him, falls to the bottom of the abyss. He reached out, and grabbed Iris&#8217; hand. But, in there,</p>

<p>“!!”</p>

<p>A broken stalactite fell from the ceiling. It’s a sharp megalith, like a giant spear. If he is skewered with that, there&#8217;ll be no remains to collect.</p>

<p>“Tsk!”</p>

<p>Haruto embraces Iris, then covers and falls over her.</p>

<p>“Wha……!?”</p>

<p>The stalactite fell to the ground, grazing the back of Haruto&#8217;s hand. Then, scattered debris pours down on his back.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><em>—— What a sorry sight.</em></p>
<p>Haruto breathe a sigh at his good-for-nothingness, and closed his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Being fascinated to a woman, my head is full of her, so I have stepped on this blunder. </em></p>
<p><em>Forget about this woman, Haruto. She is the princess of the empire. Of course, she’s not the kind of person that can be your partner one way or another.</em></p>

<p>“Uhmm……”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!? Geez, you’re being vacant——”</p>

<p>As he opens his eyes, he sees Iris’ face at close range.</p>
<p>It was slightly dyed, and her eyes are moist and wavering.</p>

<p>&#8220;……I’m sorry&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no &#8230;&#8230;it’s nothing really&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Wait, why are you being reserved for doing it! Me!!</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><em>But, her body is …&#8230; amazingly, soft.</em></p>
<p>Haruto touched Iris&#8217; body under him for the first time, and realized such existence. It was surprisingly small, and slender. If he treats it roughly, it will break.</p>
<p>And above anything else, it has the best embrace sensation.</p>
<p>That comfort, holds the magic power for him to forget everything except Iris.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the same with Iris.</p>
<p>The feeling of being held in a man&#8217;s arms for the first time, made her feel like she was drifting in the clouds.</p>
<p><em>How comfortable it is to entrust myself to a rigid, and strong body.</em></p>
<p>A woman&#8217;s desire overflows from her, and her lower body gets hot.</p>
<p>At the same time as the sensual door opens,</p>
<p>Hidden inside their bodies, the half body of the Demon King slightly strengthened its sign.</p>
<p>However, it was only for a moment.</p>
<p>Soon, Iris regained her sanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah …&#8230;uhhm, I’m already okay, so …&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a little force, she pushes Haruto&#8217;s chest.</p>

<p>“……Eh?”</p>

<p>Haruto noticed at this late hour, that he had pushed her down.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p>“Uohh a!?”</p>

<p>When he jumped up like a spring mechanism, he made a displease expression as if to hide his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“My bad, this…… I didn&#8217;t mean to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>“N,no, it is I who should say so…… I was thinking a little deeply, and was negligent. Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she politely thanked him, she bowed her head strongly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.Have you gone mad&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, are the princess of the Empire, but. Why did you bow to a Blaze resident, like me, who’s a commoner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s natural to thank your lifesaver. Even if it is your enemy. Your social standing doesn’t have a connection with it, right?”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Iris answers so like it’s a matter of course.</p>
<p>To such straight eyes of her, Haruto flinched.</p>
<p>As though, there was no discrimination feelings from her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, why did you help me? Even risking yourself &#8230;&#8230; if I had fallen as it was, Blaze’s dream would come true.”</p>

<p>That was certainly correct.</p>
<p>On why Haruto helped Iris, he really didn’t know —— No, he really knows.</p>
<p>However, he can&#8217;t admit it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, I can freely move my body. This is good.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hence, even if the other person is me, you’ve helped me—— what was that?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p><em>Rather, I wonder if I’ve become frantic so far because the other party was Iris</em> —— like that, Haruto asks himself in his heart.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>When she stared at Haruto, who closed his mouth in a hurry, Iris noticed that blood was dripping from his right hand.</p>

<p>“You’re hurt!?”</p>

<p>Haruto sees the blood flowing from his right hand, and clicks his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shit, you&#8217;ve seen a part of me that&#8217;s not cool &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You cared about such a thing in this situation!? Show it to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>When Iris took the handkerchief out of her pocket, she dabs it on the back of Haruto&#8217;s hand. Looking at the red stain on her white handkerchief, a question spread on Iris.</p>
<p><em>——This person, why did he save me with his body? </em></p>
<p><em>Blaze are heinous existence, and if they see a human being of Absolute, they will try to kill them if there is a chance. If the other party is a woman, they’ll kill her after disparaging her. If it was a child, they’ll make them a slave.</em></p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been taught.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this person different from other Blazes?</em></p>
<p><em>Or&#8230;&#8230; Is the knowledge I learned different? </em></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;This looks so expensive, I can’t compensate for it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need it&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Don&#8217;t you hate Blaze?&#8221;</p>

<p>With Iris&#8217; hand holding Haruto&#8217;s hand, she stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“……Blaze is the country, that robbed me plenty of things…… that&#8217;s why I hate it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, why are you treating me? You&#8217;ve already paid me back with your thanks. You don&#8217;t have to go this far, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris wrapped her handkerchief around Haruto&#8217;s palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My body move unintentionally, and here I am treating you.“</p>
<p>“What’s, that”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Haruto laughed involuntarily.</p>
<p>To that carefree smile, Iris&#8217; chest certainly jumped.</p>

<p>“……Your laughing face, this is the first time I saw it.”</p>
<p>“Your laughing face, I haven&#8217;t seen it yet.”</p>

<p>Iris looked displeased as if she had been told that she was mean. She tightly closes her mouth, and brings her eyebrows together.</p>
<p>In such, it was a look that he had never seen before.</p>
<p><em>Her angry face is also cute.</em> Haruto’s chest became hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;From your previous question.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough, I &#8230;&#8230; perhaps I wanted to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>“But I am, an Absolute aristocrat which you hate, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it myself, but &#8230;&#8230; somehow, you&#8217;re special.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><em>——Special, huh.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;I’m the princess of the Absolute Empire, and the head magician.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little tedious, Iris murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, doesn&#8217;t matter, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Eh?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather, you’re fine like that.”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; heartbeat intensified.</p>
<p>It was the first time she had been told such a thing. Because of her status and assets, she thought it was her own worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what’s the worth to me, who is neither a princess nor a leading magician?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, it feels like you rich people are troubled because you don&#8217;t know how to use money, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, whether he was making fun of her who’s a princess, Iris&#8217; eyes become steep.</p>

<p>“You’re so attractive, cute, has a good style, beautiful voice, has a strong sword and magic, smart, has a good personality, kind, and so on. With how much status you have, you can feel at ease. Going that far, that was merely a decoration of your identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, he told her as if spitting out.</p>
<p>By the time she finished listening, Iris&#8217; face was dyed bright red.</p>
<p><em>Thi……this is the first time, without any twists, appearances, elegance, or sophistication, that I&#8217;ve been complemented straight! It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing, though!! </em></p>
