<h3>Short Story &#8211; The Maids' Complain</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the fairy maid's room in Naraku basement, four fairy maids are gathering.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Basically,
one room is for four people, and each room has its own work rotation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Today
is their day off.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are sitting in their seats. Somehow, all 4 of them have a big bump on their
heads.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bumps are punishment for deceiving "SUR, True Vampire Knight Nazuna Level
9999".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"When
we protested against the Head Maid's monopoly on cleaning our Lord's room, she
got angry with us. Isn't this already a good reason to raise a revolt against
the Head Maid?" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maid, who looks very beautiful but seems to have a weak personality,
spoke up her mind.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
strongly agree. I really envy her for monopolizing our Lord's room cleaning
duty!" [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
serious-looking fairy maid with glasses pushes up her frame and violently
agrees.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
gal fairy maid sitting next to her suggests a dangerous idea.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But,
she's the Head Maid, so there is no way we can win. Should we poison her?"
[Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
no, no, she's immune to poisons. Her 9999 level is not just for show off."
[Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
last one, she also has a beautiful face, but her bangs are long, and her vibe
is somewhat dark. But on the contrary, she had an aura that made the weak and
timid boys like her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"In
the end, fairy maids with level 500 like us are no match to her. I envy the
Head Maid. I want to clean our Lord's room too!" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know what you mean. I also want to smell his bed as the payment." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
strongly agree!" [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
serious maid with shiny glasses asserted strongly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other hand, the nerdy fairy maid smiles lustfully and says...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Uh,
uuh, I want to li, li, lick My Lord's fork or whatever he used to eat!"
[Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Pervert!"
[Ordinary]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
most ordinary fairy maid unconsciously shouts at her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But,
but, but if any of you had a fork used by Master, you would lick it,
right?" [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Lick
it." [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Lick."
[Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'll
definitely lick it." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ri,
ri, right!" [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
four of them affirmed without any hesitation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Suddenly,
the gal fairy maid remembered something and says...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
Head Maid is also busy with internal affairs, so she should at least leave the
cleaning of her private room to us. The Head Maid was the first person summoned
by Raito-sama, right?" [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
right.</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">ã€€</span><span class="calibre13">Why
all of a sudden?" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
I recall, it was about 3 months before Aoyuki-sama was summoned......."
[Glasses]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sound of the maids gulping down their saliva echoed through the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"At
that time, they were alone inside Naraku dungeon, which was full of dangerous
monsters. My Lord was just 12 years old boy, and his level was lower than ours.
Alone with my Lord in that condition... " [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Da,
da, da, dangerous dungeon. A young man and a young woman. It, it, it's
impossible if nothing happened..." [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maid's room is enveloped by silence.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
I can't stop being jealous to Head Maid!" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
wish she'd explode. In fact, shouldn't she explode?" [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
we can convert our jealousy into a curse, no matter how strong the Head Maid
is~...." [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Destroy,
destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy,
destroy, destroy......" [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
a terrible thing to hear. Even though I brought you good news." [Mei]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
third party's voice echoed in the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
the fairy maids turned their gaze to the door at once.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
SUR, Mei the seeker maid, level 9999, is standing there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
put on a calm face even though she heard the fairy maids' jealousy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"He,
Head Maid! If you're going to enter a room, you should at least knock!"
[Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
did. You girls were just too busy complaining about me, so you didn't notice.
I've got good news for you, but I think I should take it to another
maids......." [Mei]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
is this 'good news' that Head Maid said earlier?" [Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the gal maid asked, Mei stopped for a second before telling her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Soon,
my Lord will return to Naraku. I had planned to choose one of you to serve him,
but..." [Mei]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
am a maid who swears absolute loyalty to the Head Maid! I'm different from the
others!" [Glasses]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
glasses maid quickly betrayed the others.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
always considered Head Maid as my big sister, mentor, and benefactor!"
[Gal]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
been respecting the Head Maid even before she was summoned!" [Ordinary]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Head
Maid! Head Maid! Head Maid! Head Maid! Please call me dog, Woof!" [Nerdy]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other maids all switched sides and begged for Mei's favor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
was no hesitation at all.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
feels a headache when she sees how they switched their attitude without any
hesitation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Have I made a mistake in educating my maids? Have I strayed from my maid
way?" [Mei]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
a moment, Mei turned her mind away from the girls' appeals and pondered whether
there was anything wrong with her maid way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
a while, that room became noisy with their self-promoting voices. </span></p>
