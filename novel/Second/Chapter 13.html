<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; I'm Full</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We passed another group of students as we rounded the drugstore and entered the restaurant where Asanagi previously made her reservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kushikatsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> restaurant?” (T/N: Kushikatsu is deep-fried skewered meat/veggies)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I mean, isn’t it obvious from the signboard?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Asanagi said, there was a signboard with the store’s name, lighting up the narrow alley. Obviously, I could read it, but that wasn’t what I meant when I asked her the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This place looks more like an  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Izakaya </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">than anything… Are we really going to eat here?” (T/N: Izakaya is essentially a Japanese-styled bar)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was right before the peak hours, so the place wasn’t packed, but most of the customers were businessmen in their suits and the youngest among them were university students…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If two high school students like us entered such a place, wouldn’t it seem a bit out of place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. This is a chain restaurant. I heard that they recently added family-friendly menus too. Everything will be okay as long as you don’t drink alcohol. Besides, this place is cheap and during this time of the day, it isn’t crowded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of family restaurants and fast-food chains nearby, but most of them were filled to the brim with people. They were mostly high school students like us, which was understandable since it was the weekend after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eating at such a place would be one of the worst things we could do today, so, if we were to fulfill our current ‘goal’, which was filling our stomachs, eating in a less crowded place would be preferable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s time, c’mon let’s go in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, alright, stop pushing me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, it’s my first time coming here, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s your first time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought they would reject our entry, but when Asanagi told them about our reservation, the waitress immediately led us to a private room. Because the restaurant looked like a bar, I was worried that the smell of alcohol would get me drunk, but it seemed like the staff had taken that into consideration, so there should be no problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The signboard gave me the impression that this place would be the kind of restaurant that only adults could enter, but in reality, this place was more like a family restaurant that happened to serve alcohol rather than an actual </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">izakaya.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I never thought that I would end up having dinner at a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kushikatsu </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">restaurant after not going out of my house for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It isn’t like I’ve never had any interest in this kind of place, but places like this always intimidated me. It was as if this place was from another world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe… This is a private room, so there’s no need to worry about accidentally meeting our classmates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This being a private room isn’t the problem here…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This place still felt like a place that high school students like us shouldn’t casually visit. Sure, they let us in, but I felt restless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was because I was nervous or too excited about it, but I felt uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Just treat this as our little adventure. C’mon, don’t just sit there, let’s order something. What do you want to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know, it’s my first time here… Huh, is that an all-you-can-eat buffet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All-you-can-eat buffet (soft drink included) for only 1.500 yen, evenings only. That was still within the range of my 2.000 yen budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then to order we have to use… This touchpad over here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, for now, let’s order pork and ham… maybe also onions and lotus roots?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Picking the safe options, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what? How about you, Asanagi? What do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Red ginger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Daring aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi started to look less and less like a minor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, we decided to order food and drinks that are easier to consume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I ordered too much of them, but I’m hungry, I’m confident I can finish it all. Besides, Asanagi could eat more food than I ever could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First thing first, a toast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, cheers!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We toasted using the glasses of Coke before drinking them up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasant cold feeling of the soft drink blessed my throat. Perhaps it was because it was chilled, but it tasted three times better than the plastic bottle one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after that, some of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kushikatsu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I had ordered were brought out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, they came out fresh. It had been a while since I had eaten freshly fried food like this, after all, most of the dinners I usually had were leftovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let’s dig in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I poured the sauce that was placed on the table and took a bite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;Yum!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Involuntarily, that word escaped my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crunchy texture of the fried batter, and the juiciness of the pork, filled my mouth as I bit into it. In addition, the sauce enhanced the flavor, leaving my mouth with a pleasant sensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know that freshly fried food could taste this good. Compared to the usual soggy stuff I ate, the difference was like heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh… So Maehara could make such a face… That’s surprising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what about it? Leave me alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi looked at me and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My cheeks heated up as I realized that she had caught me in such an embarrassing situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m gonna be completely at her mercy today, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever. …This tastes really good, I’ll order four more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we continued to eat for the whole hour without starting any conversation. I could proudly say that we both fully enjoyed our meal.</span></p>
