<h3>Chapter 54 &#8211; Alone in the Weekend</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Going back in time, when both me and Asanagi returned to Amami-san’s side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umi, are you sure this is alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I think it’s the best option for all of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Asanagi decided that both of us should refrain from hanging out for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Asanagi apologized, Amami-san said that she would let bygones be bygones. She said that she wasn’t mad anymore and she wouldn’t mind if Asanagi were to continue to hang out with me during the weekend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Asanagi didn’t back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, you don’t have to beat yourself up over this, okay? I’m the one at fault this time, I hurt you because I’m an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Yuu, you aren’t an idiot. I’m the idiotic one. I acted tough and hid everything from everyone, thinking that I did everything for you. But that was just an excuse. In the end, I did that because I couldn’t trust you. And I called myself your best friend, what a joke…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only she confronted her two friends when she first found out that they lied to her, or immediately talked about it with Amami-san, maybe the four of them could have discussed everything properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Human relationship was like metal, once it was twisted, even if you tried to repair it, it would never be able to return to its original state. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like with her two friends, Asanagi and Amami-san’s relationship would never return to how it was previously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure those two cases were different, but from my observation, I didn’t think that this was out of the realm of possibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki-kun, are you okay with that? Umi is someone who will keep her word. If she says she won’t hang out with you for a while, she really won’t hang out with you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right&#8230; Well, I know how stubborn she could be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hadn’t set a definite time frame, but considering her personality, it would take a while before we could hang out normally again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I would feel lonely. After all, we’ve been having a good time together all this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Knowing that, you’ll still follow through with this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I have to respect her decision, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming our resolutions, Amami-san continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously… Both of you are idiots!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">True. I mean, she went out her way to forgive us and yet here we were, asking her to not let us off easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Yuu. You see, I feel like I can’t move on from this if I don’t do at least this much… I don’t want us to be ‘best friends’ only on paper… I want us to be real ‘best friends’, Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Amami-san, somewhere in Asanagi’s heart, she probably couldn’t bring herself to trust Amami-san. That was why she didn’t consult Amami-san about her problem with Nitori-san and Houjou-san. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a stubborn, petty, idiotic person with an ugly inferiority complex… There were even times when I was looking down on you… Despite that, are you still willing to be friends with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi had been reflecting and tried to change herself. She was trying to become a true ‘best friend’ to Amami-san this time by exposing her uglier side to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Friends? …Not best friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I think it’s better if we were to start over. Starting as friends… Wouldn’t it be strange if we start over as best friends? I mean, how would that make sense?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why she decided to stop hanging out with me for a while. Instead of trying to fix their relationship, she decided to start everything over instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umi, are you serious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I am.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi answered her without looking away. Seeing her resolution, Amami-san let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine. If that’s what you want. From now on, let’s be friends for real, Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Yuu. Thank you for listening to my selfishness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. You can be as selfish as you want with me from now on. I’ll just have to be selfish with you as well, right~?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them faced each other and grabbed each other&#8217;s hands tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They said that they were going to start over and whatnot, but looking at how they were doing right now, it wouldn’t be long before their relationship returned to normal. Hell, there was a big chance that they would become even better friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, both of them still cared about each other deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the three of us agreed to spend our weekends separately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi, where should we go today? We can go wherever you want to go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I haven’t gone to the arcade in a while. Let’s go there, there’s a game I want to play.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently they were going to go to the arcade today. It seemed like Amami-san had turned down her other friends’ invitation to hang out so she could go with Asanagi instead. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? That’s unusual… What kind of game do you want to play?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A game to increase my stock of tokens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Increase your tokens?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san tilted her head in confusion. Yeah, Asanagi decided to show her uglier self to Amami-san, but showing off gambling addiction was simply overkill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Asanagi…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I know, I know.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Huh? What is it? What are you guys talking about?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Amami-san, please, you’re my only hope. If this dumbass goes out of control later, please take her tokens away.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Huh? Uhm, I don’t understand, but sure. If things get dangerous I’ll do that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: You two, what are you on about? I know my limits, I won’t go out of control.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Said every addict ever.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Huh? I don’t understand, seriously, what are you guys talking about??]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Amami-san joined our group chat and we used this whenever we needed to communicate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, we could still chat in private, but I found myself using this group chat more often, lately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Then, I’ll be going home first.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Sure. Bye bye, Maki-kun.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Bye.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After sending that, I went home alone as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time in a long while that I was alone on Friday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;S-so cold… Ugh… the heating devices are all dead…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom had called the repairman, but they wouldn’t come until tomorrow, so I had to endure the cold tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I prepared a warm cup of coffee and grabbed a blanket from my room. If I were to wear my sweatshirt and curl myself up in a blanket, I would be able to endure the cold for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Brr… Fuu…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrapped myself in the blanket before sipping the coffee. I would be fine like this for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like always, I ordered dinner, but unlike usual, I decided to order myself some soup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, this is Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Ah, hello~ The usual, I assume?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Also, add corn soup to my order, please.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Thank you very much for your patronage. Ah, we’re a little short staffed today, so it’ll take a little longer for us to deliver your order, I’m sorry for the inconvenience.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s fine, please take your time.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Thank you for the understanding. Then, we’ll send the usual delivery lady for you~}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Done. All I needed to do now was wait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, for now I should…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment about what I should do and decided to play a game like usual. I hadn’t played online in a while since I had been playing against Asanagi. She was so persistent, she just refused to leave me alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoops, I slipped… Ah… Damn…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because I stopped playing online for a while, but I felt really rusty. Well, I had been spending the last three months bullying Asanagi, this was bound to happen, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I should stop playing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I would’ve played to the point where I’d lost track of time, but this time, I turned off the game after I went on a losing streak. I went back to my room to get a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This one was my favorite. Normally, I would be reading this over and over whenever I’d have the time, but this time…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… It just doesn’t feel the same…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got bored after reading the first few pages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to do other things as well, but the result was the same. I got bored and stopped soon after I started. In the end, I laid down on the couch while listening to music.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been doing the things I used to do to entertain myself, but I couldn’t find myself enjoying them right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I knew why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It just isn’t the same without her…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I would be able to enjoy myself even if she wasn’t around. After all, she messed with me and tried to pester me over every little thing, but now that she isn&#8217;t here… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her frustrated face when I beat her black and blue in the game… Her face when she laughed at those lame B-movies… Her stubbornness over her opinion about her favorite character…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the past few months, she had always been by my side at this time of the week. The pretty and cool Asanagi Umi. Though whenever she was with me, she turned into a lame, timid, uncute and spoiled girl. But despite that, her smile was cute and she was my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Friday without her just didn’t feel the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, this was what we decided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was trying her best to fix her relationship with Amami-san. She was trying to be a friend that Amami-san could trust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I&#8217;m fine with this situation. Besides, this situation wouldn’t last forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, everything would go back to normal again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn’t take long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking of that, the bell rang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! My food is here, now where did I put the money again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I should fill my stomach first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, I’ll open the door–”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Heya, Maki-kun~}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Amami-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t the delivery lady who came, but Amami-san, who was supposed to be at the arcade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? Do you need something?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Yes, I got a delivery for you, Maki-kun… Jeez, don’t be shy and come forward already, Maki-kun is here!}</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{W-wait, Yuu! I understand, don’t pull me over like that!}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? That voice…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san pulled her while showing off her angelic smile like usual.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{H-hello, I’m from Pizza Rocket}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You aren’t cut out for this, Asanagi…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{S-shut up, you idiot! I hate you!}</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away as she said that. I was a hundred percent sure that it was my imagination, but her face looked cuter than usual when she did that.</span></p>
