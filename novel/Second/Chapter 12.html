<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Asanagi is So Cool</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reservation time was coming up, so Asanagi and I quickly left the station and headed downtown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, I don’t mind you walking next to me, you know? If you walk behind me like that people will think that you’re stalking me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ah, right. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was the one who knew the location of the restaurant, so I intended to follow her from behind, but as expected, walking three steps behind her was a bad move, huh? I involuntarily sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked half a step closer to her, but she admonished me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, I said, walk next to me, come closer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Asanagi pulled me by the arm and we walked half a step away instead, practically side by side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our shoulders were just barely touching. I felt uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me that the shop we were going to visit was located in a narrow alley. From the main road until we reach a certain drugstore on the left side of the road, turn left toward the alley right beside the drugstore. We wouldn’t get lost looking for the shop because the route was straightforward and easy to follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, I knew it was coming, but, Maehara, you’re such a pain in the ass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped, okay? This is my first time doing something like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked forward, my gaze stopped at the group of students wearing their uniforms in front of us, students from another school. As they strolled along, chatting happily with their group, consisting of both girls and boys, I couldn’t help but think that they lived in a different world than mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I looked at Asanagi, who was walking next to me with her hands hidden inside her hoodie pockets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Asanagi, do you and Amami-san hang out around here often?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. Though, we just wander around aimlessly here. Depending on how we felt, we might go to the karaoke or if we got hungry, we’d go to a cafe, something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… As expected, I can’t relate with that at all…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like I stated previously, I did come here once in a while, but whenever I did, I always had a purpose for doing so. Buying new games, books, or doing other errands. Even right now, I had a purpose for coming here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I didn’t need to go outside, I’d rather laze around in my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s such a lonely way of seeing things. Maehara, you’re just overthinking it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi seemed to have a different opinion than mine though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I mean is that you don’t need to have a clear purpose. For example, if we were hanging out with Yuu and she asked us to go to karaoke, but Maehara butted in and said that there’s a new kind of dessert being released, and asked Yuu and I to go and try it instead. With that, we naturally made plans along the way. In this case, it’s ‘karaoke’ and ‘eating desserts’, so even if we originally went out without a purpose, we’ll still be able to have fun. Understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… That’s… Yeah, I get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could understand from their interactions in class that the reason why Amami-san kept inviting Asanagi to hang out with her was that she genuinely wanted to spend more time with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things such as karaoke and the like were mere afterthoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why, even if we don’t have a clear purpose, we’ve actually already achieved our goal, which was to spend our time with our friends. If you think of it that way, our activities wouldn’t seem like a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that regard, we aren’t really all that different from that group in front of us. After all, we’re doing the same thing, hanging out with our friends. Whether it’s outside or at your house, we are essentially doing the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why Asanagi and I hung out often was not to ‘play some games’ or ‘eat dinner together’, rather it was because we wanted to spend our time together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something like ‘eating dinner together’ was a mere afterthought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, sure I spent less time with you than with Yuu and the others, but I still enjoy spending my time with you, even though I always get annoyed when you beat my avatar into a pulp… Also, you don&#8217;t get annoyed whenever I make inappropriate jokes or call you a loner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m actually pissed off by that, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I got pissed off whenever she did something like that, but I didn’t mind it because it would be meaningless to say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I knew Asanagi was joking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, when you’re in Amami-san’s group you seem to be fully immersed in your role, huh? Like, I could totally see you wearing a suit, like a manager or something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up… But well, you know, doing that is stressful sometimes, especially when I have to deal with a lot of people at once. That’s why I need this kind of peaceful time once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And said peaceful time is… Hanging out with a loner like me? Are you really okay with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, I’m okay with it. You’ve been a great help, thanks a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“? What’s wrong? You sound like an iguana that was crushed by a 4WD.” (T/N 4WD is a toy car, if you play Yakuza, they called it pocket circuit in that game)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, well… Wait, what the heck? What’s with that comparison?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Thank you for being honest with m</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">e’– I couldn’t say that directly to her face, no way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">—Seriously, this person is so cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hated myself for thinking that.</span></p>
