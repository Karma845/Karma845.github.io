<h3>Chapter 59 &#8211; Lover’s Hold</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was ready for anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever it took to make amends with Amami-san and more than anything, I didn’t want to lose the precious time I had with Umi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we left the house, we could only walk in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was so embarrassing…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki, your hand is sweaty…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yours too…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so what? It’s my first time doing something like this, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were walking to school together while holding hands, with our fingers intertwined. The so-called ‘Lover’s Hold’.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;What are they doing this early in the morning?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They are… freshmen? The girl looks cute, but the boy is a bit… Is this a punishment game?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of people from our school on the road during this time, so I could hear words being thrown at us. Nine out of ten people were hurling remarks filled with jealousy at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I would probably snap at them, but this time there was something more important than those guys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san’s ‘request’, I have to focus on finishing it properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, where’s Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ten meters behind us… Hiding behind that pole… She’s laughing at us…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;At least she’s having fun, I guess…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In exchange for breaking our previous agreement, Amami-san, in all her mercy, gave us a condition.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the moment we left my home until we entered the classroom, we had to walk hand in hand like lovers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all. Once we entered the classroom, we were free to do whatever we wanted. We didn’t need to announce our relationship to the whole class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, entering the classroom hand in hand like that should give people enough hints that we were close, we didn’t need to elaborate, people will come to that conclusion on their own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I can’t believe that someone started a rumor of me dating Amami-san… I was so ready to be confronted by the guys after the festival ended, especially Seki-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right. Nina and a few others asked me about it too. But since that rumor was baseless, I managed to brush them off easily.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rumor came out of nowhere and no one knew who started it. Apparently it had been circulating in the class during and after the preparations for the festival. I only found out about it by chance because I barely had any friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back though, anyone could easily make up those kinds of rumors if they were to consider my circumstances at that time. I was friends with Amami-san, I knew her phone number, and during the festival preparation, we were together often. It was no wonder that some people misunderstood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they were slightly off. Amami-san wasn’t the one I was close with, it was the girl right next to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, Amami-san was attractive, even more so than Umi. But to me, she was nothing more than ‘a friend of a friend’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently Umi told Amami-san about the rumors and to prove them wrong, she planned this whole ‘holding hands like lovers thing’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, this method seemed to be effective, save from the embarrassment me and Umi had to deal with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I couldn’t see them among the crowd, I was sure that some of our classmates were watching us. I casually glanced toward Amami-san and before I knew it, Nitta-san was there, walking side by side with Amami-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san was trying to stop her from taking pictures, but since she was the gossip-loving Nitta-san, that wouldn’t stop her from spreading rumors about us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That Nina… Hehe… I’ll make her regret this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Go easy on her, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to calm Umi, who had been muttering something dangerous ever since she noticed Nitta-san. After that, we passed through the school gate and went straight to the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes without saying how everything went after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone inside the classroom immediately dropped what they were currently doing and sent us curious gazes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-then, see you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mhm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We let go of each other’s hands and went to our respective seats and pretended like nothing happened. Of course, our classmates wouldn’t let us off easily like that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eh? What? Really?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They were on the committee together, so it’s possible, but, really?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hey, why don’t you ask one of them?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No way. Asanagi is scary, you know?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other subject of the conversation, Umi was happily chatting with Amami-san, who came a bit later than us while giving Nitta-san an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">iron claw</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. (T/N: The wrestling move)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay~ I know that everyone is sick of Monday already, but that won’t stop me from starting the class, okay~? …Huh? What’s wrong? Why is everyone so quiet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s nothing wrong, sensei, you can start the class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi-san? Are you on duty today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, but we want the class to start earlier today, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you guys are acting strange…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Are we now?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eek!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, you shouldn’t try to reason with her right now, sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh. S-sorry… L-let’s start the class now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Umi’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">persuasion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, sensei immediately started the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uh, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. I’ll leave everything to your imagination, Ooyama-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, during the class, Umi acted really cutely. I could see her ears were bright red for the entire period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My decision on claiming her for myself before anyone could find out how cute she was, was a correct one, I think.</span></p>
