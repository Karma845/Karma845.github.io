<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Nickname</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I befriended Asanagi-san, going to school didn’t feel like that much of a pain anymore. It was still a hassle, mind you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our school day started pretty early in the morning, at around 7.30 a.m., so we had to wake up at 6.30 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I wasn’t a bad student by any means, I hated studying. I’d rather not study if I could help it, and I found myself wishing for the school to be closed because of some random accidents quite often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, that didn’t happen today, so I had no choice but to force myself out of bed and go to school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tend to go to school early, though it wasn’t because I was excited about it. There was a good reason for me to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quietly bowed toward the principal as he greeted the students from in front of the school gate, then walked through the sparsely populated corridor to my classroom. My watch showed that it was 7.15 a.m. Since the corridors usually got crowded around five minutes before class started, I could hide behind the crowds and enter the classroom with them, but there was a small problem with that plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You’ll understand if you were to look at the other classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, good morning, you’re early today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“My club had morning practice today, it just ended. I had to wake up at five…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah… as expected, you guys just built different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately left them. Those people should’ve chatted inside the classroom, but for some reason, they decided to chat in front of the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably met each other in front of the class and started to talk as soon as they did. Obviously, this was annoying, especially whenever I told them to move (because they were in the way), they would glare at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The later it got, the more people would do something like this, this was the reason why I tried my best to come to school earlier than the crowds would.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, good morning, Yuu-chin ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Nina-chan, mornin’ ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Sadly, my luck today was rotten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person in front of me was Amami-san and… Nitta-san, I think? She hung out with Amami-san and Asanagi-san often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most classrooms had two doors, so when something like this happened, you could just enter the classroom from the other door, but, unfortunately, since my classroom was located at the end of the hallway, it only had one entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, if I wanted to enter the classroom, I had to shoo those two away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu-chin, did you watch </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> last night?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, I watched it live last night. Himuro-kun was awesome, wasn’t he ~ ?” (idk how to make this one clearer, what she meant is that she watch a show in real-time and not from recording like what japanese people normally do, help me)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are they talking about, I wonder? A show? Maybe a male idol appeared on the show, who knows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around that time last night, what did I do again? Shooting people on Apex?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, whatever, since they were talking about some nonsense I didn’t know about, I decided to go to the toilet to waste some time. I did this previously and it worked, so it is worth a shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I washed my hands in the bathroom, fiddled with my bangs that I never really cared about, then peeked toward the entrance again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my time, so I should’ve wasted a few minutes on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They shouldn’t take more than three minutes to chat like that, so I should be able to enter the classroom now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m more of a fan of Edamura-chan than Himuro, he has this “bad boy” aura, you know what I mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I can see that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Himuro-kun is still irreplaceable though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Somehow, they multiplied…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my time, but I forgot to consider that Amami-san was there too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crowd would naturally form around her, no matter the time and place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would have a better chance shooing them off when there were only two of them. I guess my plan backfired, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave up resisting and decided to face them head-on. After all, if I were to loiter around the toilet again, people would give me a strange look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I realized it, the crowd around Amami-san had increased from three people to four. Still, the space they occupied was a narrow one, why didn’t they just sit down somewhere in class? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, excuse me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to them, but guess they didn’t hear me since Amami-san and her group continued their talks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was standing right in front of them, none of them noticed me. Either they were too absorbed in their conversation or I just didn’t have a strong presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I just shout at them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, there’ll be another broadcast today at eleven!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, really? That’s sick ~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to call them out again, but their numbers increased from four to five at that moment and my voice was drowned by their chatter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I’m getting pissed… Should I start something here? I mean, whatever happens next, at least it would be a good stress reliever…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, you’re in the way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to call out to them again, a sixth person entered the crowd and landed a karate chop on Amami-san’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Asanagi-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Scooch, I need to go to the restroom. You guys are crowding the door, I can’t get through. Also, don’t you realize you’re blocking other people’s way too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch, ouch… Right… sorry, Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you understand, now, move, shoo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Umi, I’ll go with yo– ouch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You just went there not too long ago, wait for me in your seat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo ~ Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Amami-san returned to her seat, the crowd around her followed. It was like watching a school of fish. Well, whatever, I could enter the classroom now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my eyes met Asanagi-san’s as she walked out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To keep our friendship a secret from the rest of the class, we would normally just ignore or avoid each other at school, but sadly, this circumstance didn’t allow me to. After all, she did that out of concern for me. I would feel guilty if I were to ignore her and treat her like a stranger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you, Asanagi-san… Also… Good morning…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… Good morning, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We whispered so that the other classmates wouldn’t notice it, then we passed each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The very next moment, Asanagi-san sent me a text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san: It feels strange, you keep calling me ‘-san’.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Then, Asanagi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san: Just call me Umi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Asanagi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san: Kidding ~ But, seriously, call me whatever you like, I’m okay with anything.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could call her by anything whenever we hung out, but I wonder if the day when we could call each other by our first name at school would ever come.</span></p>
