<h3>Chapter 49 &#8211; Asanagi Umi and Amami Yuu</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was around seven years ago that I, Asanagi Umi met Amami Yuu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was walking back home with my friends after school ended. I saw her small figure walking alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My first impression of her was that she was really pretty. She had long golden hair and fair skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I noticed her, I left my friends and approached her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl suddenly trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked like a squirrel, it was cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s face looked like a doll. Her cheeks were round and plump, adding to her cuteness. Her clear blue eyes looked at me cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that she was a foreigner, but she actually spoke perfect Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that wasn’t important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m Asanagi, Asanagi Umi. You?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Uhm… I-I’m Yuu… Amami Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Yuu-chan! What grade are you in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Third grade… I recently moved here…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was much shorter than me, so I assumed that she was younger, but we were actually the same age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, I remembered my friends in another class told me that someone was transferring in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this girl was the new student?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you walking alone? Where are your friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don’t have any friends…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she was this cute? I thought she would gather everyone’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, before I transferred here, everyone avoided me because my hair and eye colors are different from everyone… Maybe, everyone here will also treat me the same… I’m scared…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuu told me about the school she transferred from and all the terrible things she experienced. Just hearing it was enough to make me angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if she looked different from everyone else, she didn’t deserve to be treated like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she was this cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only I met her earlier, I would be able to protect her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuuh, I see. Then, why don’t we walk home together from now on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at me with a confused look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Why is she so surprised? She needs help, doesn’t she? Isn’t it natural for me to help her if that’s the case?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it lonely, walking home alone like this? Or am I not good enough for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, that isn’t the case… B-but… are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! What are you hesitating for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I mean, if everyone were to see you hanging out with me, Asanagi-san will be–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine~ Don’t worry about me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her hands and wrapped it tightly with my own. She was startled, but I didn’t let go of her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if everyone avoids me, I won’t be alone! …I mean, I’ll have you, after all, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Asanagi-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can call me Umi, in return, I’ll call you Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already made up my mind when I decided to approach her and talk to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would never let her be all alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it, Umi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you smile for me~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?? …B-but, that’s embarrassing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please ~ Just this once ~ Do it for me, please. I want to see your cute smile!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-uu… Then, just this once, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, in that empty alleyway, Yuu showed me an awkward smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Cute…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw it, I unconsciously blurted that out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the same time, I thought of something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her gloomy expression didn’t suit her, she should never show that expression ever again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, she should show everyone her angelic smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let’s go home together, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Umi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can drop the honorifics, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? T-then… Umi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, like that. You called my name correctly, good girl, good girl~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From then on, Yuu and I became friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was where it all began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, I immediately introduced Yuu to my other friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were Nitori Sanae and Houjou Manaka. The three of us had been especially close since we started grade school and we usually went to school together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, they are both good girls, just like me~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If Umi says so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if it was a good idea to introduce her to my other friends. But I decided that it should be fine, and if I were to do it, the sooner the better. Currently, Yuu was very attached to me. If I let her act like this for a long time, she might stop trying to make more friends altogether and become overly dependent on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to spend as much time with her as possible, but I couldn’t be there all the time. I had my own life after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I decided to introduce her to my friends. The more friends she had, the less lonely she would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My name is Amami Yuu… I’m from class 3-1… Nice to meet you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, nice to meet you too, Yuu-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu-chan, you’re so pretty! So cute!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course both Sanae and Manaka accepted her. Well, I discussed about this with both of them beforehand, but who cares~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you, Yuu ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm! Thank you, Umi! Thanks to you, I made more friends!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I didn’t do much, don’t mind it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not trying to brag, but I had a lot of friends. I hung out with Sanae and Manaka the most, but I also had friends in other classes as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I let her enter my circle of friends, everyone would be able to get along well and have fun with her and she wouldn’t get lonely easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I was right about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe ~ Umi, Sana-chan, Mana-chan ~ This way, this way ~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuu started to smile more often in front of everyone. She steadily regained the confidence that she’d lost, back when she was isolated in her previous school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I’d hoped, she was finally able to show her angelic smile freely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up to that point, everything went as planned. As I stood next to her, I felt proud to see her growing as time went by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up to that point, everything went well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Up to that point… yeah…</span></p>
