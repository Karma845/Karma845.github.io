<h3>Chapter 39 &#8211; Changing Feelings</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next day. Our work with Amami-san continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Seriously? Yuuchin, you drew this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! Since it’s my first cultural festival, I wanted to do my best on it and I got carried away. I finished this in a night and didn’t manage to catch any sleep… Hehehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san showed everyone the picture she had drawn with a shy smile on her face. The picture was based on the sketch we had decided to use yesterday and it was already fully colored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, Asanagi sent me the same picture over email earlier this morning, so I had already checked it out and gave Amami-san the ok. And since Nitta-san and the others gave their praises like this, we can safely say that the quality of the picture is great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the mosaic art sketch, we could scan the picture, then use a freeware to turn it into mosaic art. After some adjustment, Asanagi and I should be able to come up with a good enough draft. When that was done, we could hand it over to the rest of the class and the committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Amami-san’s hard carry, we could increase our pace by a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We did it, Umi! Our all-nighter was worth it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! It was so hard to keep myself awake too. If I weren’t the representative, maybe I would have stolen Yuu’s bed and slept in instead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently Asanagi was up all night helping Amami-san. She looked so worn out, I felt bad for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, she was staying over at Amami-san’s place, but since they were both girls, no one made a fuss about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, if they were of different genders, the atmosphere in the class would be very different. People would start to bring up malicious rumors and things would quickly turn sour. Well, that’s how society works, so there was no point  fretting over it no matter how unreasonable it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only society were more tolerant about such things, I wouldn’t have felt that nervous back when that incident happened…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, let’s forget about it and focus on my work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, today was Friday. I had more time to work than usual. It was the least I could do considering Amami-san and Asanagi had given their all. I had to reward their hard work with my own hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today’s schedule would be making some minor adjustments and calculating the number of cans and other necessary materials needed for the mosaic art. Once that is done, we could finally work on the actual mosaic art starting from Monday next week.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No time to play even though it’s the weekend, huh?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Asanagi looked really tired today, I didn’t want to force her to do any more work. Deadline? Screw that. We had plenty of time before the deadline, and if Asanagi were to push herself any more than this, she would collapse and I wouldn’t let that happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Good work.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Praise me more.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Good girl, good girl~ You worked hard didn’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I’m not a dog, stop that!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Kidding… Was it hard? Helping Amami-san out, I mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Obviously, it was.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Well, glad everything is over now. So head home and get some sleep, okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Mmm… Well, I’ll do that. I worked too hard yesterday after all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Alright, thanks for your hard work. I’ll send everything to you on Sunday, okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: ‘Kaay. I’ll send it over to Yuu later.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face looked so tired, but at least it seemed like her gloominess from yesterday was gone. She acted normally in texts too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like I was worrying over nothing yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s Maki-kun, hello ~! Let’s do our best for the festival together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Y-yeah… sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up, I saw Amami-san waving her hands cheerfully at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi who was supposed to help her out was pretty much incapacitated, but the one who did most of the work looked perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from talent, she had a ridiculous amount of stamina as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, is she even human?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school. I felt a little tired because I still had to go through the classes like normal, even though I already had my hands full with the committee work. And I still had more work to do when I got home.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yes, it’s Pizza Rocket!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, this is Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah! Hello! You’re gonna order the usual thing ~?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I’m a regular, I only needed to tell them my name and they would know what I was going to order. It’s surprising that they actually bothered to remember my name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But anyway, I ordered the usual pizza, fries, and nuggets set, though I asked them to change the drink to an energy drink instead. Not like it would actually help me, but it set the mood, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, let’s get started before the food arrives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s been a while…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was unusually quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only sound that could be heard in this room was the sound of my PC fan and my mutterings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about it, this was actually how everything used to be. Me sitting alone in this dimly lit room, playing games while eating junk food. If I got bored, I would read some manga or watch random videos on the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything changed when that girl, Asanagi Umi, suddenly barged into my life uninvited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she didn’t change my habits or anything, her mere presence livened up this gloomy room. The stagnant air in this room had changed into refreshing, sweet air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had known her for less than three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind to let her rest this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I guess I still missed her presence here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Jeez, why am I such a mess…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, the living room felt rather spacious, but it felt quite stifling to me. Unconsciously, I grabbed my phone and made a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there was only one person that I would call in this situation.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Hello? What’s wrong?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, Asanagi. Were you sleeping?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I was going to take a nap before dinner. I haven’t bathed yet, so I’m not gonna sleep yet. I’m not an old man, you know?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… I see.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{So, what’s up? It’s rare for you to call me like this… Is there a problem with the sketch?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I was just wondering, is it okay to leave all the adjustments to me?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I missed you, I wanted to hear your voice. You’ve always been by my side lately, I’m lonely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to tell her that, but there’s no way I could do that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Yeah sure, and?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… well, I feel bad calling you like this even though you’re exhausted…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why the hell am I so nervous?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only need to tell her to come…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… As expected, I can’t do this alone, you see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">{Mhm?}</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, can you come over? Also, we can relax while we’re working on the sketch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only I decided to text her instead, I wouldn’t be this awkward. Why is talking so hard? I can’t even express myself properly.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;I see, so you miss me.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{It’s obvious, you know? I knew it, Maehara Maki can’t live without me, the one and only, Asanagi Umi. I’m flattered.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no! Ugh, whatever. I called you because I was worried that you might feel lonely without me and this is what I get?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Hmm? Hmmm?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was completely on me. I shouldn’t have called her. I stuttered for a second and now I had to deal with her teasing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face and cheeks felt extremely hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, whatever. I’ll do everything on my own, see you. Also, you don’t have to forget about this call… Just don’t mention it to anyone.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Fine ~ Then, in exchange, can I ask you something?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short pause, Asanagi continued.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Can I come over anyway? …I want to spend more time with you too…}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Look at this girl, after all that teasing she said something like this to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really can’t beat her, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… I don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Hehe, thank you. I’ll come soon… Ah right, order some more food for me, I’ll pay for it of course.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she said that, she hung up the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since this was her we were talking about, she would get here real soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… Guess I gotta call mom, huh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was going to be like any other Friday, but somehow I felt restless.</span></p>
