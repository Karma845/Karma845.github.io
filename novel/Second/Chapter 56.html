<h3>Chapter 56 &#8211; By Ourselves (2)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After cleaning up, Asanagi and I went back to the couch and decided to watch a movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In our apartment building, we were required to sign up for an internet connection as soon as we moved in. As a result, we were able to watch exclusive channels including plenty of movies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which one do you want to watch, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever you want to watch, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There it is, the ‘it’s up to you’ answer… What about this one?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was looking at the TV timetable, I noticed there was a special program titled ‘(Special Program) 12 hours of crocodile movies!’ There was a list of movies ranging from masterpieces that even I recognized to obscure B-movies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love exclusive channels because sometimes they have these kinds of events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm… That seems fine, let’s watch that. After the shark movie, it’s croc movies now, it’s perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she was interested in it, good to know. Now we had something to talk about at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Achoo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to change the channel, I suddenly sneezed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t noticed, but it seemed like the temperature had dropped some more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara? You’re sneezing, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? Ah, yeah, I’m fine. My nose was itchy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It isn’t okay… If you feel cold, then tell me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I was alright until a few minutes ago, you know? It’s nothing, don’t worry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, you’re such a pain in the ass…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi then unwrapped the blanket and beckoned me to come over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here, quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t give me that confused look! Y-You are feeling cold, aren’t you? Then come here, hurry up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want us to share the blanket?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-don’t say that out loud, idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she wasn’t trying to tease me, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay sure… Excuse m– Achoo!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh jeez, hurry up! Both of us will catch a cold at this rate, you slowpoke!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to obey her for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, make yourself at home~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I sat down next to her, Asanagi pulled herself closer to me. We huddled inside the blanket together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-um, what about we share my scarf too. Let me wrap it around you, turn your face over here, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh… Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t even try to argue, just do it quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did as she told and she wrapped her scarf around my neck. Now I was wrapped in both a blanket and a scarf, with Asanagi right next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There, now I only need to wrap the other half on my neck…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, are you actually going to do this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After wrapping the scarf around my neck, Asanagi started wrapping it around hers too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now our necks were both wrapped with the scarf and our shoulders were touching each other’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-there it is… Doesn’t it feel warmer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah sure… But don’t you think it’s embarrassing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, this was embarrassing as heck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-shut up, deal with it. Also, aren’t we going to watch a movie?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mhm… Then…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my attention to the screen, but of course I couldn’t concentrate on it in this kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt cold a while ago, but now my face was getting warmer and warmer as my embarrassment started to build. I could feel my whole body sweating too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t the first time that the both of us were this close, but I couldn’t stop my heart from pounding wildly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could smell her sweet fragrance since we were so close. Even though we had just finished eating, how could she still smell this good?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This made me self-conscious about my smell. I ate a lot of garlic just now, did I smell like garlic?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no. I’m just wondering if I smell or not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, glad you noticed. Seriously you smell like sh*t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? R-really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This f*cker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow ow! Hey, stop pinching me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously… She noticed that I was nervous, didn’t she? Of course she would take the chance to tease me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouchie… Sorry, sorry. But seriously, don&#8217;t worry about it, you don’t smell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Rather, I’m worried about myself. Do I smell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about that, you don’t smell. Rather, you smell good, I feel blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crap, I misspoke…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying it that way made me sound like a pervert…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I meant, I don’t care! Your smell isn’t important, right? Rather, let’s just focus on the movie, the movie!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-why are you laughing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm~ It’s fine, you’re just being honest. You don’t need to make random excuses like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she was going to tease me again, but it seemed like she was serious about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing her, even if I were to pinch her cheek to make her forget about everything, she wouldn’t budge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s new. You aren’t trying to tease me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way. I mean, I’m probably used to your scent already… Do you remember the time when I slept here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, that time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, she slept in my bed twice. Once when she accidentally fell asleep and once when she slept over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though my bedding was clean at that time, my smell should linger around there. Now I felt bad about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… Also, you aren’t the only one who gets nervous at times like this, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Asanagi moved closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel her warmth through her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made me feel even more nervous, but at the same time I wanted to stay like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The movie was entering the scene where the man-eating crocodile was fighting with the crocodile hunter, but both of us were focused on each other’s faces rather than the TV screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I call you Maki?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If that’s what you want, Umi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi’s face instantly turned red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, what’s wrong, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ora!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow! What are you doing?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki, you’re getting too cocky.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Still, you don’t need to hit me… You’re being unreasonable!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe… Yeah, I’m unreasonable, got a problem with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was all pouty just a moment ago and now she embraced me in her arms. Seriously, her mood swings were insane.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From being happy to being angry, smiling giddily and getting embarrassed. Her expressions changed a lot in the past few hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I had to admit that this was what made her cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You know, Umi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to say this once, so listen carefully.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Mhm. What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, you know… you can’t see your own face right now, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mhm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Your face right now… Your smile is really cute… Even Amami-san’s can’t match that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thought that she couldn’t compare to Amami-san in terms of looks, but that simply wasn’t true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The real Asanagi Umi’s charm wouldn’t lose to Amami-san’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I wasn’t the only one who thought this. Of that, I was certain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why, be more confident. You should smile more at school too. I’m sure everyone will look at you more if you do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hey, Maki.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard my words, her smile turned to a wry one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki, do you actually love me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to make excuses to myself that I liked her as friends, but I guess I couldn’t run away from my feelings anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time I’ve felt this way, so I wasn’t entirely sure. But my feelings for her were different from the fondness one would feel toward a friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, we were just friends who hung out every so often, but as we hung out more and more, I got to know more about her and she eventually became a bigger part of my life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cherished this girl in front of me. And I wasn’t completely sure that my feelings toward her were appropriate for friends or best friends to have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I really didn’t want to tell her about this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-not really… Seriously, what the hell are you on about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no. No way that’s the case. I mean, really? ‘Your smiling face is really cute… Even Amami-san’s face can’t match that’, what else it is if it isn’t an indirect confession?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?! That’s just a normal compliment!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Liar~ Come on, be honest with me~ Look at my face and say ‘I love you’. C’mon~ Or do you want to kiss my cheek too? Go ahead~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez! Stop that! Seriously, I’m not happy right now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo… Even though I’m ready for you. You’re such a tsundere~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop poking my cheeks!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, Umi continued to tease me until it was time for her to go back home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The movie was playing, but we had no idea what it was about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, this Friday went on like every other Friday.</span></p>
