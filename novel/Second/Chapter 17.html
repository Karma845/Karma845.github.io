<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; On Our Way Home</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the arcade, I immediately left the building and headed toward the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was 10 pm, so the station was filled with mostly adults, as the students had gone home earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I finished buying my ticket and passed through the gate, I noticed Asanagi hiding behind a pillar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both lightly waved before walking toward the station platform together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just to make sure, did you bump into Amami-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I did, I wouldn’t be here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that was the case, it would be fine even if we take the same train home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We boarded the train heading for the next station, which arrived shortly after we arrived at the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a weekend night, the train was crowded with businessmen and college students coming back home after finishing their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Whoops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I got inside the train and tried to take a breather, my feet felt wobbly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my first time playing in the arcade, then there was that batting game and the encounter with Amami-san. I guess my physical and mental exhaustion came rushing in, replacing the tension I had previously felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, are you okay? There’s an empty seat over there, you should sit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine, just a little dizzy. You’re the one who should sit, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m physically stronger than you, I’m fine… C’mon, just sit down, don’t think too much about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait… Ugh, jeez, fine, I got it, so stop pushing me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat at the only vacant seat and Asanagi followed me and stood right in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distance to the next station was short and the ride would only take a few minutes, so, I guess it would be fine to let her stand like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t bring myself to say anything to Asanagi, who was looking down at me, so I gave up on doing that and glanced away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I were supposed to be equal, but at this moment I felt like a frog being stared down by a snake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Maehara. You had to go through all that because of me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rattling noise in the background served as a BGM as Asanagi, who was holding the train’s hanging strap, blurted those words out of her mouth while staring at me, looking apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean… The thing with Amami-san back in the arcade?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… I heard most of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t tell her in detail what was going on, but it seemed like my phone picked up everything for her to hear. I knew it was an old model, but, seriously, I don’t need such an unnecessary feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to concern yourself about it, Asanagi. It’s true that aside from Amami-san, the others dislike my presence there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that out of consideration to Asanagi, but honestly, I didn’t think what Amami-san did back then was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Asanagi was there, she would definitely stop her, but she wasn’t there. That was the reason why the situation devolved as quickly as it did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, there was no need for you to be so hostile to them, you know? If you said something like that right to their faces, they would treat you even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s true, but still…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I was aware that Amami-san had no ill intention when she invited me. She probably did that because she saw me alone at school often and was worried about me. So, to make me not feel isolated from the rest of the class, she invited me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I refused her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me, eating dinner with Asanagi, playing games at the arcade, holding that unfamiliar bat… Being together with my friend who I could truly be myself around was more than enough. I didn’t want that pleasant feeling to be ruined by hanging out with those people who clearly didn’t want to be around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I lashed out back then… and it was much too late to regret what I had done. I’ve made my bed, so now I have to sleep in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only would they label me as a loner, but from now on, they would also label me as someone who couldn’t read the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’ll follow up with Yuu later. That child is a worrywart, so I’m sure that she’ll call me… Ah, here comes her text.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quick… What did Amami-san say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Umi, what should I do, I think I did something bad to Maehara-kun’, she said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I made her worry about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have done a better job back then, but I was too preoccupied with keeping Asanagi away from her to pay any attention toward anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry… I didn’t mean to cause you any trouble…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Helping you out when you’re in trouble is what ‘friends’ are for, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Friends, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Asanagi as she reached for my head and began to stroke it gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm? Nothing much, your head is just in the perfect position for patting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was totally treating me like a child, wasn’t she? Still, I was too exhausted to bother with this, so I let her do whatever she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The train’s shaking, the warm atmosphere, and the warmth of Asanagi’s hand…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, my eyelids started to feel heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you feel sleepy, just sleep, I’ll wake you up when we are near our stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, I’ll leave it to you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to resist the drowsiness, I slowly closed my eyelids while Asanagi was still patting my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…’Thank you, Maki.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my consciousness was slowly leaving me, I heard a soft whisper in my ears.</span></p>
