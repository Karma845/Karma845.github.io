<h3>Chapter 46 &#8211; Friends</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I finally made up and promised to talk about everything properly during the festival. For now, we decided to focus on our work.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Umi, Maki-kun, welcome back ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two are late! Were you two busy flirting behind our backs?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;We were busy cleaning the cans. Also, didn’t I tell you guys to clean them properly before you collect them? So why are some of them dirty, hm? Nina, was my instruction not clear enough?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m sorry! …Y-you’re scaring me…”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, an empty can cleanly hit Nitta-san’s forehead and bounced toward Amami-san’s side. Well, she was actually spot on. Our talk took up most of our time; the cleaning took way less time than we initially thought.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… Anyway, we’ve got all the cans needed for row A through F, so we can finally arrange them according to the draft and connect them with the strings…”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Asanagi was bully– I mean, giving a warning to Nitta-san, I gave out instructions to the rest of the classmates.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I called out to Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, Amami-san, I want to change the color on some of the parts, so please come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Okay? Sure, but do we have to move places to talk…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t want to distract the others. Asanagi-san, come with me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah… Mm… Okay.”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi responded with her usual tone, but her voice was slightly trembling.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That should give Amami-san an idea about what kind of conversation we were going to have.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the classroom since this wasn&#8217;t the kind of thing that we wanted others to overhear.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go ahead, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my back as Asanagi took a step closer to Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu… Umm… about the other day…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry I was being selfish… I even told you to forget about everything… I’ll tell you everything soon, okay? Do you mind waiting…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, I don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san easily accepted Asanagi’s request.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? A-are you sure? Even though I wronged you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! Aren’t we best friends? If you think you need more time to tell me everything, sure, I can wait.”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While it would be normal for her to hold a small grudge over this, Amami-san instead showed Asanagi her usual carefree smile.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess we’re both the same kind of person, huh?</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s that. Good for you, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Thank you, Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem~”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, everything should be fine until the festival starts. As for what would happen later, that would be for our future selves to solve.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right, Maehara, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You finally remembered that I’m here, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, your presence is thin, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, so cruel…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, I’ll take that as a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, this was the Asanagi I knew. The reliable, cool girl who would sometimes show her mischievous side.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Stare~</span></i></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she found out anyway, I decided to stop pretending to be a reserved guy and talked in my normal tone. This resulted in Amami-san giving us quite the glare.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi, Maki-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it, Yuu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys became friends two months ago, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Uhh… yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Around that long, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She studied our faces closely with a difficult expression.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two are just friends, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““Y-yes…””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm….”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a low hum as her frown deepened.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could understand her skepticism. It was hard to believe that we were merely friends since we definitely did things that normal friends wouldn’t do. But it wasn’t like we were lovers or anything…</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were certain that we were at least friends though.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oh well, I’ll leave it at this, for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thank you…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, yeah, now that everything is done, we should hurry back to the classroom. Umi, Maki-kun, you have to supervise everyone’s work, right?”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san quickly shifted her mood, leaving the two of us in an awkward mood instead.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The festival will start in three weeks, I hoped that it would come sooner though.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I left them and went to the staff room to return the storage room key to Yagisawa-sensei.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here’s the key, Yagisawa-sensei.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? Ah, thanks for the hard work, Maehara-kun. So, how is everything? Tell me, tell me~”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was working hard, she was sipping her coffee carefreely like this…</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was supposed to be a hopeless loner, she dragged me into the spotlight by making me the representative for the committee… Seriously, what a horrible person… Well, the lottery part was completely on me for having such rotten luck, but she was the one who started the whole thing, so she shared the blame.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right… We might have to stay the night the day before the festival, can I get an application form in advance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I’ll give you a copy of it tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright… Then, excuse me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Maehara-kun, wait a second.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought we were done, but it seemed like she still had other business with me.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm yes. You look tired, but you’re giving off a different air than before. How should I say this? You look cool.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see… Then, please excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You still need to work on your friendliness though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thanks for your input… Please excuse me, everyone is waiting for me…”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored her and left the staff room.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was she on about? Me? Gave off a different air?</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Cool…”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my phone and looked at my face using the LCD screen as a mirror.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Cool, huh?”</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…If anything, my face looked boring rather than cool. Seriously, what was she on about?</span></p>
