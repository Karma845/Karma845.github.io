<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; A Loner's Hidden Skill</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of us settled on having lunch together, and the morning quickly flew by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our mornings usually started with homeroom, followed by 4 periods of lessons. Normally, those classes felt like an eternity, but today, it felt like it was over in a flash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say the flow of time is constant, but right now, it doesn’t seem that way. I wonder if there is someone out there who has the power to skip through time? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm ~ Finally, the morning classes are over ~ It felt longer than usual, don’t you think so, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s the opposite for me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi locked her eyes with mine. As expected, she was worried about what will happen after this, like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, our classmates would leave the classroom immediately after the bell, but today, most of them stayed behind and observed the three of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, it’s just having lunch with a male classmate. Why are you guys turning this into a big deal? &#8230;Also, Nina, put your phone away…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… ehehehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Asanagi called her out, Nitta-san’s phone slipped out from her sleeves and fell to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, one can’t let their guard down against her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Asanagi said, why would people turn this matter into a big deal? It isn’t like we’ll do anything more than talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha… We can’t really eat inside the classroom like this… Should we eat outside? It’s a bit chilly though…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I’d prefer somewhere warmer, but whatever… Are you okay with this, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the three of us left the classroom to look for a good place to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi, where should we go? I usually eat in class or in the cafeteria, so I don’t know of any good spots.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… the courtyard is fine, but that place is usually crowded. I don’t particularly mind, but… Maehara-kun, what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">True, the courtyard was crowded, but not enough to not have any vacant spots to sit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they thought that it was fine to eat there, I wouldn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hey, are those two girls over there freshmen?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Seems like it. They both look cute, especially that blonde girl’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What about that gloomy guy in the back? Why is he following them? A stalker?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just by walking down the corridor, we were bombarded by this kind of talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was just the two of them, they could just ignore it because people just kept calling them ‘cute’ over and over, but they were also hurling rude remarks at me, and Asanagi and Amami-san couldn’t just ignore those comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we were to eat in this kind of environment, we wouldn’t be able to enjoy our meal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, if it’s okay with you two…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to them as they were talking about eating lunch in the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been eating my lunch in the classroom lately, so I haven’t had a chance to show off my hidden skill, but now I have the opportunity. My hidden skill, finding a hidden spot in the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, it’s true. This place is so empty, I can’t believe it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s warmer here, there aren’t any tables, but there are benches… Yeah, this place is perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right? I’m glad that no one is using this place today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spot I recommended was the ‘faculty smoking area’. It was located on the south side of the school grounds, next to the faculty building where the staff and principal offices were located.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, until a few years ago, this area had been a place for the teachers who liked to smoke to relax during lunch breaks. But recently, due to shifting trends, smoking was eventually banned outright on school grounds.  As a result, no one used this place anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We cleaned the dusty benches and picked up the scattered cigarette butts… Compared to the courtyard, this place was smaller and covered in weeds. Though, to be fair the courtyard was well-managed. Still, this place was perfect if we wanted to stay away from the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The perfect place for a loner like me to relax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, this was the only place I could think of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be! This place is great! Thank you, Maki-kun! Umi too, thank him, quickly!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you getting ahead of yourself now, hm, Yuu? …Well, thank you, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them seemed to be satisfied with the place. They quickly sat down and spread out their lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Maki-kun, your egg rolls look delicious. Wanna trade for a sausage?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind, but I made it myself, so it might not taste good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, it’s fine… Wait, you make your own lunches, Maki-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, whenever my mom is busy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san seemed surprised, but in truth, it wasn’t that difficult to do. I just used leftovers from last night’s dinner and made some simple side dishes. As long as I woke up earlier, I could prepare lunch easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I did slack a lot, I live alone with my mom, so I did occasionally help her with chores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, what should we do? Maki-kun has more girl power than us…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t ask me, I lost to him by default…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi looked at me for a moment, I guess she had something to say to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah… This egg roll is yummy! The sweetness and saltiness are perfect!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? …Maehara-kun, can I have some too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment she put the egg roll in her mouth, Asanagi’s eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How was it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;This is unfair…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just a simple dish. I just added a pinch of sugar and some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shirodashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> when I made it. I’m glad that they both liked it though. (T/N: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirodashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is colorless </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">dashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Dashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a soup stock made from bonito flakes or kelp)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m curious about what Asanagi meant by ‘unfair’, but whatever, I’ll take it as a compliment.</span></p>
