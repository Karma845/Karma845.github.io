<h3>Chapter 61 &#8211; From Now On (2)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We cleaned up the remaining food before continuing our conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s continue…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a quick gulp of her coke, Umi opened her mouth to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… To start. I confessed to you impulsively, but I didn’t regret it. After all, my feelings for you are genuine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, is it safe for me to assume that you want to go out with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mmm. Our tastes in food are similar… If I were to ignore your appearance, you’re fun to hang out with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha. Well, as long as you dress up a little, you don’t need to worry about your appearance, really. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. Believe me, I fell for you, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mhm, as expected, she loved me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, her feelings seemed to be stronger than mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she still felt uneasy about going out with me for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I might be overthinking things… You see… I got scared that if I were to go out with you then I&#8217;d end up like before… Even though I’m supposed to trust you, I can’t help but think that some girl would take you away from me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who would even do that? I refrained from interjecting and let her continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess the trauma of being deceived by her friends was still there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if her friends apologized to her, I doubt that the scar in her heart would disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, you’re afraid of me betraying you… That’s why you’re so hesitant, am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, something like that… I know that I have to deal with that feeling someday, or else I wouldn’t be able to move on, but… I just don’t know what to do…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi laughed weakly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl had rejected countless confessions, but when it came to her own confession, she became like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was supposed to be a simple matter. If you like the person, you’d just go out with them. If you don’t, then you don’t. It’s that simple. But unfortunately, it wasn’t that simple of a matter for either of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s it. My honest feeling. Like I said, I’m a troublesome woman…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t pout. It’s true that you’re troublesome, but I know what I’m getting myself into. I fell in love with this troublesome Umi after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Idiot…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood her worries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was feeling uneasy about dating me, then all I needed to do was to get rid of that feeling for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It shouldn’t be difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hold her hands, and tell her pretty words to ease her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, um… Your hand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? A-ahh… Okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently grasped Umi’s hand and she responded by grasping mine back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was our routine, our way to comfort each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except this time, I wanted to go a step further than this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also… close your eyes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? …Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you want me to explain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was puzzled by my sudden request, but she seemed to understand my intention as her face turned bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? What’s wrong, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-uhm… D-Do I really need to close my eyes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it would be awkward if you don’t…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I don’t want to…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away, but I wouldn’t back down easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It might hurt the first time, Umi, but don’t worry, I’ll be gentle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what are you talking about, idiot?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried to shake my hand away, but I had a firm grip on her hand, so her attempt was useless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“J-Jeez! I love you, Maki… But this is all so sudden! I’m not ready! …At least set the mood properly first!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just accept it, Umi. You can’t run away anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cornered her to the edge of the couch while slowly approaching her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-be gentle, please?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, don’t worry about it, I’ll be careful…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Idiot! Maki, you’re a pervert!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She eventually gave in, but her body was still tense. She squeezed her eyes shut while putting her pouty lips forward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, here I go…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held her hand while moving my face closer to hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ora!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flicked her forehead with a moderate amount of force. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot. I’m not going to force myself on you like that. Anyway, sorry, that hurted a little, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu… I-It’s fine. I was just surprised, I didn’t expect that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, I misled you, sorry. But there’s no way that I’d tell you honestly that I’m about to do that. Also, the opportunity to tease you was too good to pass up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, that was intentional… you jerk…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I teased you a lot in the past too, so I’ll call it even. Anyway, I assume that head flick was a punishment of some sort?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Something like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that this matter was settled, it was my turn to tell her properly about my feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi, when you said that you were worried about going out with me, were you wishing that I would comfort you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, it isn’t like I’ll be upset with you even if that’s the case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;J-just a little…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a little?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;N-no, I wanted you to comfort me! I was anxious, okay? Go easy on me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I figured that was the case. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, truth be told, I want to comfort you. Saying cheesy words like ‘I’m not going to betray you’, or quelling your anxiety with an ‘I love you’…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, why didn’t you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because that wouldn’t solve anything. Those words will ease you temporarily, but your anxiety won&#8217;t go away just like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe if I were to soothe her with my words, her feelings for me may deepen, and we might progress our relationship further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I didn’t do that because I knew better. I knew a certain couple that fell in love with each other the same way, but in the end their relationship became irreconcilable. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, would you like to hear about my parents?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t a good story or anything, but I wanted her to know about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I got it. Let me hear your story, Maki…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Umi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was winter during my third year of middle school, right around the time when Umi’s friendship cracked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trouble was brewing inside my house.</span></p>
