<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Maki-kun</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at school around the usual time in the morning, a cheerful-looking Amami-san greeted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Maki-kun, good morning ~ It’s a good day, innit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Y-yeah, true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, you don’t need to act so reserved around me ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a pleasant day, the sky was blue without a single cloud. But who cares about the weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My classmates’ looked back and forth between Amami-san and me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… Yuu-chin, can I ask you a question…? Who is Maki-kun…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ninacchi, are you joking ~? It’s Maehara-kun’s name. How could you forget?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? A-ahh, t-there’s no way I could forget something like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She obviously forgot. Not only her, I’m sure everyone in the class also forgot. But that’s not the issue here. It’s the fact that Amami-san referred to me by my given name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just yesterday that she referred to me by ‘Maehara-kun’. Today she suddenly called me ‘Maki-kun’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some people would definitely get strange ideas about what happened yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu-chin seems to be getting along well with Maehara… Did something happen yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I made up with Maki-kun yesterday and we became friends. Right, Maki-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Amami-san’s words, the class immediately went into an uproar. It was like this yesterday, but it got even noisier today.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oi, oi, seriously?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Amami-san and that gloomy guy?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe, he blackmailed her?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Blackmail how?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You know, skimpy photos, maybe?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Are you guys stupid? If I blackmailed her, there’s no way Amami-san would cheerfully greet me like this!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, I didn’t have the courage to shout at them, so I decided to feign ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, when we parted, Amami-san asked me to be her friend and I accepted her request. That was why she referred to me by my given name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san called all her friends by their given names. For example, she called Asanagi, ‘Umi’ and Nitta-san, ‘Nina. She also liked giving her close friends nicknames, according to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what everyone thinks of him, but Maki-kun is really nice! He doesn’t talk much in class and is a relatively quiet person, but he’s honest and smart! Just like Umi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you’re exaggerating…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess I do have some similarities to Asanagi; both our favorite foods and the way we perceive things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not at all, right, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sure, I’m your best friend, but, if he comes to hate you because you’re too pushy toward him, I can’t help you, okay? Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, u-umm ehehe ~ Well, I think Umi and Maki-kun will be able to get along well! You should both become friends and exchange your phone numbers already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did I just say…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to mention exchanging phone numbers; we texted each other rather frequently, but there was no way that Amami-san knew about that. That was why we decided to gloss over the topic when it came up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I wonder what would happen if Amami-san saw us when we hung out. After all, our relationship had already disregarded the barrier of gender. We stopped minding that a while ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, Maki-kun, do you have any plans for lunch today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No, not really…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, to celebrate us becoming friends, let’s have lunch together!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘T-together?!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that, the buzzing inside the class got even louder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu! No matter how you look at it, that’s a bad idea!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Maki-kun said he hates being in groups, so being with me alone should put him at ease! Am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, logically speaking, sure, but… Maehara-kun, what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-um… Well, if anything, I’d probably be even more nervous if you did that… I think…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san was not only the idol of the class but the entire school year as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thought of having lunch with someone like that made my stomach churn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what if Umi joins? It will be the three of us instead of just two! Besides, Umi was with Maki-kun yesterday too, so everything will be fine! What do you think, Maki-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was that Asanagi was also a beauty, second only to Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I refused her offer again, the whole class would think of me as a stubborn guy and that would be bad… I had no choice but to accept, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright. Let’s eat together…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Yay ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After hearing my answer, Amami-san raised her hands to the sky innocently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she okay in the head? Being this happy just to have lunch with someone like me… seriously?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Maki-kun! Umi, he gave us the OK!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes yes, I’m happy for you. Sorry, Maehara-kun, you’ll have to deal with our Princess’ selfishness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no… I should be apologizing for getting you involved in something like this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It couldn’t be helped, but I ended up relying on Asanagi here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a saying; ‘Help each other in tough times.’ While I agree with that saying, I’d rather not rely on others to deal with my problems if possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we returned to our seats, I immediately sent Asanagi a text message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: My bad, Asanagi, I had to rely on you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: It can’t be helped, it isn’t like our relationship is exposed anyway, let’s just move on.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: …Right. Thanks, Asanagi, I’m glad that you were there.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: You’re welcome. I’m your friend too, you know? It’s a given that I’ll help you.] [Besides…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Besides?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Never mind.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Okay…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my phone away and looked at Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t notice my gaze as she was staring intently at her phone, but I noticed her face was redder than usual.</span></p>
