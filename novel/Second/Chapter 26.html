<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Weekend With You</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the side dishes exchange was done, we had a chat about cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was wondering what I should talk about over lunch with Amami-san, but this topic came up. Since it was a particularly safe topic, I decided to roll with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow… So Maki-kun can also make sweets… I got the impression that you aren’t an ordinary person after tasting your egg rolls, but after hearing this… That wasn’t even half of your true power, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s only this much, even you can do it if you try though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the cost of the ingredients and time, it was better to just buy sweets from a shop. But since I hated leaving my house, I’d rather make it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what kind of sweets did you make recently?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it was… Banana Souffle Pancake?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-banana Souffle Pancake??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Astonished, Amami-san repeated the words that I just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-hey, Umi, did I hear wrong? Did Maki-kun just say that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get a hold of yourself, Yuu! It’s unbelievable, but he did say that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were looking at me as if I was a Namekian or something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are they even so astonished about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I mean, it isn’t that hard. You just need to look up a recipe on the internet and follow it step by step.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… easier said than done… Some people struggle even if they follow the recipe, right, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, Yuu here has the ability to turn ingredients into dark matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, that’s actually possible?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Umi! You’re the same as me! On Valentine&#8217;s day last year,  you made me a pile of charcoal, didn’t you? Don’t tell me you forgot about that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those were cookies! At least mine were still edible compared to yours! What was yours supposed to be again? A replacement for fossil fuel?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess neither of them had any talent for cooking. So Asanagi was just a big eater then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right. On Valentine’s, we usually just gave our friends chocolates that we made. We didn’t really have that certain someone to give our chocolates to, you see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come to think of it, both of you are from Tachibana All-Girls Junior High, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tachibana All-Girls was the best all-girls school in the city. The girls from rich families and the girls that had astounding grades attended that school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an escalator school. They offered education from elementary school up to high school. I heard that the majority of the students would continue their education there instead of transferring to another school, but those two… Well, I guess I shouldn’t pry about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably had their own circumstances, like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m so ~ envious ~ I love sweets, you know? Now that Maki-kun told me about his skills, I want to taste the desserts that Maki-kun makes! Banana Souffle Pancake ~ Banana Souffle Pancake ~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… If you want it, I can make some for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, really? You’ll make me some? Yay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san smiled brightly as she threw both her hands into the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ingredients, including toppings, would cost around 500 yen. That should be cheaper compared to ordering at a cafe somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll have to go to Maki-kun’s house again. Ah, I can’t go today because I have other things to do, but another day… How about this Friday? My schedule is free that day. Oh right, I won’t tell anyone about it, so you don’t have to worry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This Friday…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would be inconvenient for me…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no definite plans at the moment, but I’ve set Friday aside to hang out with Asanagi. Of course, she never asked me to, but I wanted to make sure that Friday would be free so Asanagi could come whenever she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, to make plans like this, I had to make sure that I had no plans to hang out with Asanagi first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, sorry, but Friday is a bad time for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. If possible, I want to keep my schedule on Friday open. Other days are fine though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a chance that Amami-san would find out about my relationship with Asanagi, so I needed to be careful when talking about this topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I make plans with Amami-san this week so that she wouldn’t find out about our secret? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, well, it isn’t like I have something to do, but… It’s just, my mom usually comes home late on Fridays, so it’s a rare chance to relax by myself, you know…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I’d rather spend my time with Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be there for her. I wanted to be the ‘friend’ that Asanagi could come to whenever she was tired from socializing with others. A different kind of ‘friend’ than what Amami-san was to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my reply, Asanagi mouthed the word ‘idiot’ while turning her gaze away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…She didn’t need to tell me that, I know I’m an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this was my honest feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, can we do it on another day? If you’re fine with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I’m fine with it! I’m the one who is imposing on you, so I should be the one adjusting my schedule! Umi, do you want to go with me next week to Maki-kun’s place? C’mon, let’s go together ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Well… Sure. As your guardian, I can’t just let you enter a man’s house by yourself, can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, thank you, Umi! It’s decided then!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we made an appointment to hang out next week. Just as we finished eating the rest of our lunch, the bell rang, a sign that lunch break will end in five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s this late already… Umi, what’s the next class?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh, it’s P.E. Right, we gotta get changed, we have to leave earlier.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Sorry, Maki-kun, we have to leave first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Have a good day, you two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm! We’re off!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Bye.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing them off, I sat down on the bench alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after that, my phone vibrated. Asanagi texted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Idiot, you could have hung out with Yuu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Sorry for being an idiot. But I’m the one who decides who I hang out with.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: That’s true, but… Do you really want to hang out with me that badly?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: No, not really.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Liar ~ C’mon, be honest with yourself, you want me, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: No, I don’t, you idiot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Look at the mirror, idiot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Cut it out, idiot, go to your next class already!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, we would end up arguing over nothing again, so I shoved my phone into my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously that Asanagi, calling other people idiot like that… This Friday, I should properly show her who’s the boss.</span></p>
