<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Unrestrained Relationship</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, the number of times I hung out with Asanagi had increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We still only hung out on Fridays, it was only an increase from once or twice a month to twice or thrice a month, but the number still increased nonetheless </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We still see each other at school (we didn’t talk though) and wasted our weekend messing around like this, so I was less concerned about our relationship compared to before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“? What? Why are you staring at me? Is there Tabasco on my face?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I was just thinking how beautiful you are, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi gave me a suspicious look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The heck? Even if you flatter me, I won’t give you any of my three nuggets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, why the hell did they sell nuggets in odd numbers? I saw them being sold in packs of five or seven each. Why couldn’t they make me happy and make it a nice even number?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, that wasn’t important right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It isn’t flattery, I’m just telling you the truth. Your face is small, even though you are quite cheeky, and you’re also quite tall… Well, you aren’t on the level of Amami-san, but hey.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What you should tell me is something along the lines of ‘Asanagi is cuter than Amami-san’. You know, being completely honest isn’t always the best, Mr. Loner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, Asanagi is the number one cutest girl in the world–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi threw me an empty plastic bottle that landed cleanly on my temple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too late. Zero points.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m no longer nervous around her, I could casually crack jokes like this. In the beginning, I used to tidy up both my room and appearance whenever she came to hang out. But lately, I stopped doing that and let my room be messy like usual. Even now, I’m just wearing a sweatshirt that I always wore to bed at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was still in her school uniform, but unlike at school where she followed the school rules to a T and dressed up neatly. Here, she stopped caring and sloppily dressed herself in her uniform… Well, today was worse than usual though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school ribbon was unattached, three of the buttons on her blouse were undone, I could even catch a glimpse of her underwear—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you looking at, pervert?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m a guy, it’s just reflex. Maybe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it isn’t like I don’t understand how you feel. It happened often with Yuu whenever I hang around her. That girl’s got no sense of danger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">True. I didn’t know if Amami-san was aware of other people’s gazes, but she triggered a lot of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">dangerous</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> events at school. For example, she would flutter her short skirt and almost reveal her underwear for everyone to see. Another example would be when she was wearing her gym uniform, she would unintentionally show her healthy skin through the hem of her shirt or her sleeves. Every time she did, all the boys would send heated gazes at her and Asanagi would scold her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And now you’re trying to imitate Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s about right. Also, Maehara, you’ve been getting carried away lately, so I thought I’d tease you a little bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, that was why she let her guard down today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Grudges over a game should be returned in the said game. Just a reminder, your record is 0 wins and 57 losses against me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look here, fighting your opponent in the field that you excel in is a legitimate strategy, even Sun Tzu said so. If you think everything will go according to your rule, too bad, that won’t happen, you gloomy pervert. I’ll tell you now, tanned gals who acted kind to loners and did perverted things with them only exist in AVs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, what the heck? How did you know about that?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi is certainly a beautiful girl, but when we hang out like this, sometimes, she annoys me a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess that’s proof that we are getting along well as friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could joke with each other like this without minding our genders, but still, I really should have tidied my room properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though we were friends, there were one or two of my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">interests</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that I didn’t want my friend to know about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s leave aside the AV matter for the time being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean for the time being? Just erase it from your memory! …What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next week I’m coming. I don’t want to bother you with all the planning over text, so I thought I’d just plan everything here and now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I don’t mind, but… I feel like we’ve been seeing each other every week lately, is that okay with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it’s okay. What? Are you getting cold feet now? You’re afraid that I’ll beat you up in your games?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll take you on any time. But, you know that’s not what I’m talking about, right? What about Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hanging out with Asanagi like this was fun, and if I got to hang out with her more often, I would gladly welcome it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if she were to spend more time with me, it meant that she had to spend less time with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a common scene at school, whenever Asanagi turned down Amami-san’s invitation to hang out with her, Amami-san would have this sad look, like a puppy that was scolded by its owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san probably liked Asanagi a lot. I’m a loner, so I could only imagine it, but when you like someone, you would probably wish that you could be together with them all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Asanagi told me that she would hang out with me next week, I felt happy, but at the same time, the happier I felt, the sadder Amami-san would get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it like that, I couldn’t help but feel guilty about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Again with that loner mindset, huh, Maehara ~? Fine, I’ll decide after I talk it out with Yuu next week. Ah, but, reserve this place for me, will you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure, I’ll do that. By the way, will I receive a cancellation fee in advance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Then, as an advance payment, I’ll let you see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tried to open the buttons of her blouse again, but I stopped her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a joke</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, she said as she laughed at me… I can’t believe this is the same girl that got 5 confessions in the span of a couple of months.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ringtone SFX.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, your alarm’s going off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phone. Ringtone. That was my phone’s ringtone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen showed an incoming call from my mother, ‘Maehara Masaki’. I left my seat as I ignored Asanagi’s voice who said, ‘What, that was your phone?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Mom? What’s up? …Mmm… Huh…? Mmm… I got it. Be safe at work.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two, Three minutes passed, I finished the call and went back to where Asanagi was waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your mother called you? That’s unusual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… But anyway, Asanagi, sorry, I have something to tell you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Asanagi what my mother just told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, we can’t hang out here next week.”</span></p>
