<h3>Chapter 42 &#8211; Things Are Proceeding Normally?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent the rest of the weekend feeling restless and before I knew it, a new week started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to leave the house earlier than usual and headed for school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had completed the sketch during the weekend. All I had left to do was make enough copies for the rest of the class, then we could start work on the mosaic art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I borrowed the school’s copy machine and copied enough sketches for the whole class and immediately went to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expected that Asanagi would be absent today because of what happened last Friday, but contrary to my expectation, she was there, sitting on her seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Amami-san was by her side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s Maki-kun! Good morning!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Amami-san… And you too, Asanagi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. Morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was slightly nervous to talk with her after what happened last Friday, but she responded to me like normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I was worried for nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here’s the finished sketch. I’ve sent you the number of cans we’ll need for each color, so check it out later. If I made an error somewhere or you want to add something to it, make sure to let me know first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, amazing! This really looks like real art! I wonder how it will look when it’s finished? What do you think, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, the original picture is good enough, it won’t turn out bad at least unless we purposely mess it up. Ah, yeah, I’ll hand out the copies to everyone, you can leave them to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, I’m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled as she received the copies from me. It was her usual smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was acting like the mess on Friday had never happened. She acted normally even with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to ask whether they resolved everything properly or not, but there was no way I could ask something like that out in the open like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought of asking her over text, but just as I was about to do that, my phone vibrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked it up, expecting that Asanagi sent me something, but when I looked at the screen, that proved to be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw a cute rabbit profile picture and the name ‘Amami’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost yelled in surprise, but I managed to hold the urge back and looked up to see Amami-san looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. It wasn’t Asanagi who sent me a text, it was Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for Asanagi, she was busy preparing for the morning class, she wasn’t even looking at her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Sorry, Maki-kun, texting you so suddenly like this.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Don’t look at me, Amami-san. Everyone will notice us if you do that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Ah, sorry.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Okay, all is good.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: So, what’s up?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Ah, Uhm… It’s about Umi… Maki-kun, have you talked to her yet?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: No, I haven’t… What about you, Amami-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Me too. I couldn’t bring myself to talk to her over the weekend.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: But, she texted me and said that everything is fine now.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: I thought you said something to her.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: What did she say?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: ‘I’m sorry about last time. Let’s just forget about it and move on.’ That’s it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: I see…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, everything was just a farce. They haven’t properly made up yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a saying; ‘a word once spoken, cannot be recalled.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you told someone to forget about the things you’ve said, and that someone tried their hardest to forget about it, the smallest trigger would bring it back up again. You could never completely forget about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we were in that exact situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I need to have a proper conversation with Asanagi. Even if the damage couldn’t be undone, we could still try to come up with a solution where everyone could be happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d hate it if her relationship were to be ruined because of my selfish request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Amami-san, for the time being, can you leave this matter to me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Yeah, everything might turn for the worse if I were to talk to her, so please, Maki-kun. I’m counting on you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: All right. I’ll report to you after school.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped texting with Amami-san and immediately sent Asanagi a text.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Hey, Asanagi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Hey, earth to Asanagi?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Why are you ignoring me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She should’ve noticed my text by now, but no matter how long I waited, she never texted me back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, Asanagi seemed to be behaving normally, but for me and Amami-san, who knew what was going on, her behavior made us feel restless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She never texted me back, even after Homeroom was done and the morning classes started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, the first period–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s chemistry. We have practicals today, so we have to go to the lab quickly. Hurry up, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aye ~ Wait, stop hitting me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still responded normally to Amami-san and Nitta-san. She even made jokes while talking about trivial things with them, but she gave me the cold shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wasn’t this whole mess about Asanagi and Amami-san? So why was I the one receiving most of the damage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I do something to her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Maki-kun, is Umi ignoring you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: …Apparently, yeah…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: Oh my…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: As expected, I should be the one to talk to her…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Nah, it’s okay, I’ll try a little harder.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Amami: You sure? If she still ignores you, let me know, okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Okay.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she kept ignoring me, I’ll just have to confront her directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, we were both class representatives for the committee. It wouldn’t draw too much attention even if I were to drag her out of the class.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope it won&#8217;t come to that though… But, if there’s no other choice…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind and went up to Asanagi, who was currently sitting in the middle of Amami-san’s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm, sorry, Asanagi-san, I need to talk to you about our exhibit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, sorry, I need to do something in the staff room. Everyone should go on ahead, don’t wait for me, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi-san, wait–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you later, Maehara-kun. Talk to me about it later after school, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time I gathered the courage to confront Amami-san’s group, but as soon as I called out to her, she immediately walked out of the classroom. Clearly she was avoiding me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My, my, Mr. representative. It seems like you’ve been dumped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you trying to hit on her? Give it up. She may look friendly, but she is a tough nut to crack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nitta-san and Seki-kun clasped my shoulders while giving me a look of pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t trying to hit on her. Seriously, these guys pissed me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, that Umi! Even though Maki-kun did all this for her!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Where are you going, Yuuchin?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To the chemistry class… That Umi, she didn’t bring her chemistry textbook with her! That was her math textbook!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Dumbass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was obvious that you were trying to avoid me. You even got yourself into this mess while doing so. Seriously, you idiot…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, jeez… That dumbass, seriously…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Maki-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san, give that book to me, I have something to do outside, I’ll give it to her along the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who cares about the dumb secret anymore. That idiot made this mess, I’ll make her regret it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether she’ll receive this textbook or not, I’ll make sure she can’t run away from this conversation.</span></p>
