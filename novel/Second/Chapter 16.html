<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; A Pinch</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were saved since Asanagi was away at this time, but I never expected to run into Amami-san here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Yuu-chin, you know each other?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, Ninacchi! He’s our classmate! We even met with him the other day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;N-now that I think about it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe they were just messing with me, but apparently, other than Amami-san, my other classmates didn’t recognize me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, I was like air in class, even if I were to walk right in front of everyone, I was completely confident that they would never notice me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara-kun, do you come here often? It’s the first time we bumped into each other here, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh… Mhm… That’s true…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I casually fiddled with my phone, pretended that I was doing something with it, but in reality, I secretly called Asanagi, before quickly shoving my phone into my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My phone was cheap and it picked up a lot of the background noises, so if I did this, my phone should be able to convey the conversation between me and Amami-san to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, are you here with someone else? Right, of course! Playing alone in this place is boring after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-something like that, yeah. I’m a little bit tired right now, so I&#8217;m taking a break by myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? I noticed there are two drinks over there, so I assumed that you’re here with someone else…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Amami-san was really observant. Of course, she also observed everyone in the class closely, it wasn’t limited to me. Normally she was like an angel, spreading her kindness toward everyone in the class, but right now, she was more of a demon than anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, no matter how obscure Asanagi’s attire was, Amami-san, her best friend, would notice that it was her immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I need to make sure that they won’t find out that Asanagi is currently here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were still keeping our relationship a secret after all, letting Amami-san and the rest of the class know about it would be bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, I’m glad that Maehara-kun has friends you can hang out with. I was a little worried about you because you were alone all the time in class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see… But, I prefer to be by myself, so you don’t need to worry about me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Well, if you feel lonely, you can always reach out to me! I don’t mind you inviting me for lunch too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m thankful that Amami-san felt concerned about me, but, after seeing the faces of her cronies… Yeah, I won’t be calling out to her in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m quite perceptive if I may say so myself, I can read the air. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don’t get ahead of yourself, loner’, that’s what they are telling me with their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your kind words… I’ll gratefully keep them in mind. Well, I have to go now…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to leave the place immediately. But as I was about to leave, Amami-san grabbed my shoulders from behind, it seemed like she had something in her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I had a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, if you want to, you can hang out with us right now, Maehara-kun! Of course, you can bring your friend along too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so surprised that I let out a strange sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Yuu-chin! Wouldn’t that inconvenience Maehara-kun? Besides, Maehara-kun seemed to be occupied with something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she didn’t fancy the idea of me tagging along, Nitta-san immediately chimed in from the back. Well, me too, even if Amami-san went through the trouble of inviting me like this, I disliked the idea. Even if Asanagi was included in her group, I would still dislike it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nitta-san is right, Amami-san. Besides, if I were to join in, everyone would have to be considerate toward me and they wouldn’t be able to enjoy themselves to the fullest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really ~? I think it would be more fun with more people though&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were a more sociable person, I would be able to blend into the group without ruining the atmosphere, but unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. I’m bad at dealing with any kind of group activity with more than three people in it, and I’d prefer not to ruin the group’s fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Asanagi were here at Amami-san’s side, she could warn her about it because she was her best friend and all, but she wasn’t here right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it’ll be more fun if Maehara-kun joins in, no? Or maybe you dislike him, Ninacchi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? N-no, no way that’s the case, right…?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Out of everyone here, Nitta-san was probably the closest person to Amami-san, but, sadly she wasn’t Asanagi, she wasn’t close enough to Amami-san to act more assertively toward her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reining in the uncontrollable Amami-san while keeping up and guiding the other people such as Nitta-san… When I first heard that Asanagi was doing something like that, I could only vaguely imagine such a scene. Now that I’ve witnessed what she was really up to, there was only one thought that popped out in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was actually doing such a troublesome thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can see why she’s exhausted…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Maehara-kun, did you say something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no, nothing… Anyway, about the thing you said previously…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry but, I don’t want to hang out with you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words, the cheerful expression on Amami-san’s face immediately turned gloomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, of course, I’m glad that Amami-san invited me, but, you see, I’m not big-hearted enough to hang out with a group of people who clearly dislike me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘In other words, you lot’, I glared at her cronies, including Nitta-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both my attitude and words were clearly filled with hostility and it would definitely deteriorate the good atmosphere they previously had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I would just ignore them and retreat, but by the time I realized it, my feelings were already leaking out of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know why I felt this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, today is the day for me and my friend to hang out together. I’m sorry, but I don’t think neither my friend nor I, would like it if someone were to intrude on our time together like this… So, my bad, I can’t accept your invitation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Maehara-kun…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, see you later, Amami-san… I appreciate the invite.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I waved lightly and shook Amami-san’s hands off, and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I vaguely heard someone trying to tell me something, but the sound of the background music drowned out their voices. Not like I cared about what they had to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making sure that no one was following me, I pulled out my phone from my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you, Maehara. You saved me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome… Well, we’ve had enough fun for today, so let’s go home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Mmm…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to meet up again at the ticket gate. In the end, we managed to escape from the arcade without being discovered by Amami-san and her cronies.</span></p>
