<h3>Chapter 37 &#8211; Failed Draw</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although things were a little thorny during the representative selection, that didn’t stop our class from putting in effort for the Cultural Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to create an exhibit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there were opinions that said we should build a haunted house or a maid cafe, the Cultural Festival staples. But other classes had the same ideas, so we decided not to go with those. Having too many competitors wasn’t exactly a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, my opinion on the matter was to open a coffee shop. We gathered everyone’s ideas, wrote them on pieces of paper, then put them inside a box before drawing it like the previous lottery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, even though the odds were higher, my idea didn’t get picked. I may have hit that 5% chance before, but not this time… Curse you, desire sensor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boys were disappointed over the fact that they couldn’t see Asanagi, Amami-san, or Nitta-san in a maid outfit, but it simply couldn’t be helped. it was for the greater good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, you bunch of perverts! Stop sulking and work seriously! We need more ideas for our exhibit! How about this? If you put in more effort, we’ll consider cosplaying during the Cultural Festival… I’m sure Yuu and Nina wouldn’t mind, right?.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“EH?? Just me and Ninacchi? What about you, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m your producer, idol-sans. I’ll be the one who will take you two to the height of popularity! You’re with me, right, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… Don’t involve me in this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During our school’s Cultural Festival, there was an event where visitors would be able to vote on which class they liked the most. The school gave awards to the classes who were in the top three. Personally speaking, the awards weren’t worth the effort. They would probably give us something like a box of ballpoint pens or the like anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no need for us to spend that much effort on this. We only needed to do enough so that nothing major would happen on the D-day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, they need to stop talking about cosplays or whatnot. We have to decide on the theme of our exhibit first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, firstly, let’s discuss Maehara-kun’s suggestion, ‘mosaic art using empty cans’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other than mine, there were various other suggestions such as creating a device based on something that was seen on TV, building a classroom-wide domino, and so on. But our budget was limited and the overall evaluation for the rank was mostly decided by how good it would look in front of the camera. In the end, they decided to go with my suggestion after considering all the limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of that, I had to sketch the picture we would be making, but I could always ask mom for help, so I wasn’t too worried. As for the materials like the empty cans, we could just ask for them from the nearby convenience stores or restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I would work on the blueprints while the rest of the class would set it up, following our instructions. That was the conclusion of today’s discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I’m beat…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having finished my work for the day, I plopped down on my desk, exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had steeled myself to work hard when it was decided that I would be the representative, but I hadn’t expected that talking in front of people could exhaust me so. The meeting was led by Asanagi, and I was merely there to support her, but I still felt exhausted. Being a recluse made me this weak, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, good work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, it’s the first meeting and you’re already like this. You won’t die during the real thing, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to say I won’t, but I could see myself dying in the near future…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure we didn’t need to spend much of our budget on the mosaic art, but in turn, the workload was heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried my best to make a schedule that wouldn’t put too much of a burden on the class, however, we would be cutting it really close to the deadline, and that was worrying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no experience and they suddenly told me to create a schedule for a big project like this. I can see myself getting burnt out in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Man, I’m thankful that you’re my partner in this, Asanagi. If it was Nitta-san or any other girl, I don’t know what would happen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Asanagi was chosen as the girls’ representative, Amami-san and Nitta-san gave us their full cooperation from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I could barely hang in there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right? Thanks to my amazing luck you’re able to rest easy… Also, here, a gift.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi handed me a crumpled piece of blank paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My lottery draw.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? She didn’t actually hit the jackpot? What’s going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Maehara, my draw was a bust. Sensei knew about it, but I had to force my way in, you see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei probably kept quiet because the atmosphere at that time was bad. That was the reason why Asanagi forcefully volunteered like that, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was a work of fate that we both hit the jackpot. But it turned out that reality doesn’t work that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t believe you had the balls to do that in the middle of that mess… Jeez, you’re something else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you angry at me, Maehara? Sorry, I lied to you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, this just means that my luck is better than yours. Besides, no one’s complaining about it, so all is well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the other girls, hitting the jackpot not only meant that they had to do a bunch of unnecessary work, they also had to deal with me as their partner, so Asanagi forcing her way in would be a form of salvation for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no need for me to make a big deal out of it. In fact, I should be thankful to her since she went out of her way to take an L for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t be mad at you. If anything, I’m glad that you’re my partner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, overall, this situation was a win for me. I had no reason to complain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s Asanagi’s way of protecting someone dear to her. knowing that, there’s no way I would be angry at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Thank you, Maehara, I feel a little better now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Glad to hear that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Hehe ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi smiled in relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had to turn my gaze away. Why does she look so cute? It’s unfair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only she showed this side of her more often, she would probably be more popular than Amami-san. Of course, I wouldn’t say that to her face, she would get cocky if I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But anyway, I’m glad that we decided it by lottery this time. If Sensei were to force the role to a random person instead, what would happen to me, I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, in that case, I could volunteer instead of whoever would be chosen. You see, Maehara, your existence is like a ticking time bomb in the eyes of the other classmates. It won’t be long until they’re sick of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ticking time bomb, really? Well, it isn’t like I can’t see where they’re coming from…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I went and said that I hated them to their faces a while ago. Of course they would be very mindful of my presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone other than my friend, Asanagi, were to deal with me for a long time, it’s inevitable that they would be sick of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, whatever, that isn’t important. Let’s decide on what to draw quickly, Asanagi. Any ideas?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I got one, what about you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Me too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve been hanging out often lately, so I’m sure that both of us are on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wanna say it together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““Here goes…””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the beginning of our cultural festival.</span></p>
