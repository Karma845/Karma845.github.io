<h2>Chapter 22&#8211; Coffee Preferences</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned home with Asanagi and prepared the tea, cookies, and other things we just bought. Not long after that, the intercom rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Heya, Maehara-kun. Amami Yuu has arrived ~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the screen of the intercom was Amami-san with her cute smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably pushed herself a little when she ran, some of her bangs were sticking to her forehead because of her sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I’ll unlock the gate in a second… Okay, come on in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Roger ~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unlocked the auto-lock and waited for Amami-san to enter. The room was a little messy because this gathering was a little bit abrupt, but it wasn’t so messy that we couldn’t receive any guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being. I shoved the pile of clothes my mother left out into her room and cleaned up the table in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, where are the plates? The cookies are one thing since it’s inside a tin, but the other snacks should be placed on a plate, no?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right. Well, the plates for the guests should be at the top of the cupboard next to the fridge, also, there should be cups and saucers nearby, use those too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I divided the roles and made the minimum preparation for us to receive Amami-san as a guest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Asanagi was also a guest, it would be fine if she were to just sit on the sofa, but…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let me help.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said, so I let her help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me ~ …O-ohh… so this is a boy’s house…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry if it seems cramped, only my mother and I live here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… S-sorry, was I rude? I-it’s my first time visiting a boy’s house, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san turned over here with flushed cheeks. She looked so natural when she talked with the other boys in the class, but seeing her reaction now, she was more inexperienced than I previously thought. She probably never dated anyone either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it, Maehara-kun? Do you have something to say to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? N-nothing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was relaxing on the sofa while watching over us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, she also acted reserved like this the first time she came to my house, but now, she treated this place like her second home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, since this was supposed to be her first time coming here, she restrained herself from acting like usual. She guided Amami-san to the table in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, a cookie tin ~? I love these. They look kind of expensive though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? We’ve been saving them for guests to eat, so, feel free to eat them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really ~? Yay ~ Umi, too, don’t just sit there, eat together with me ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, but first, let’s wipe that sweat off your face first, okay? Here’s a handkerchief.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you ~ …Wait, don’t treat me like a kid!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“High school students are still technically kids ~ Also, don’t forget to wash your hands before eating, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Muu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Amami-san was distracted, Asanagi moved on to take care of her best friend like it was the natural thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They should be of the same age, but looking at them like this, they seem like a pair of sisters. Though this was a common sight even at school, it was their usual routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi taking care of the pouting Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help but admire the scene. It would be great if someone were to immortalize this in a painting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… Amami-san, what would you like to drink? Coffee or black tea…? Well, we also have some green tea if you prefer that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I think I’ll have a coffee ~ With a lot of sugar and milk, please!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, by the way, you said you like sweets?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Ah, do you remember what I said in my introduction?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… Yeah, well, your introduction was impactful after all…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned on the stove, put the kettle above it, and prepared the coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san asked for sugar and milk, so I put them inside. Asanagi preferred her coffee bitter, so I only put milk in her’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Umi, when did you ask for your coffee? It seemed like Maehara-kun was also preparing yours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Amami-san said that my body stiffened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I completely forgot that it was supposed to be Asanagi’s first time here and I was supposed to ask her preference for formality sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been doing this all the time, so my body just moved naturally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm? Ah, I asked for it before Yuu came here. Coffee, no sugar but with milk, right, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh… Y-yes, that’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was getting tense, Asanagi gave me her follow-up. Since we arrived first, there should be nothing strange with that answer. Nice one, Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, like planned, we’re going to talk about last week&#8217;s incident, but before that… Yuu, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm. What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, how exactly did you guys know each other&#8217;s phone numbers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““Ugh…””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi narrowed her eyes as she looked at us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was smiling, but that smile didn’t reach her eyes. It was really scary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Toward this Asanagi, Amami-san, and I immediately confessed and apologized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Well, I had a feeling it would be like this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Umi, I knew I shouldn’t have done that, but I was worried about you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too, sorry I didn’t mention any of this to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“? Maehara-kun, why are you also apologizing? You’re just involved in this because of me and Nina, you aren’t doing anything wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true, but I didn’t reprimand you two at the time, so, I’m just as guilty…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi already forgave me, but since I kept the matter of Amami-san’s phone number a secret from her, I thought that I should apologize for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously… Yuu, bring your face closer. You too, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and Amami-san brought our faces closer to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, I felt a sharp pain in my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It hurts!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s your punishment, Asanagi-style: Forehead Flick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like Asanagi did a forehead flick to me… But, it hurt so badly, it felt like she was stabbing my forehead with a needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The part that she hit still felt numb even after a while. Maybe I got internal bleeding from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not mad or anything, I’m just trying to make it even for the three of us. Also, this should clear your head a little, right, Yuu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes… Sorry about this, Maehara-kun, it’s because I did something strange that you got involved in this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-it’s okay, I always felt bad toward Asanagi-san too, it’s convenient for me if anything…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this is the power of Asanagi-style: Forehead Flick… I should never try to keep anything hidden from Asanagi in the future. Even if I have a thousand foreheads, I wouldn’t be able to endure her ridiculous power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s all for now. If you guys ever do something like this again, I’ll show you guys the true power of Asanagi-style: Forehead Flick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The true power…? So that wasn’t even her final form??</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… Amami-san… The thing Asanagi-san said…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to Amami-san, she turned her gaze at me as our eyes met. She gave me a silent nod with a pale face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Wanna try it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I politely refuse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How did you even come up with such a technique?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-style: Forehead Flick…How terrifying.</span></p>
