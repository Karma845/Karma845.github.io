<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Sleepy Asanagi</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, Asanagi has been coming to hang out with me every week lately. Is it really okay for her to not hang out with her other friends?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That thought suddenly crossed my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard my classmates mention that Fridays were the most popular day to hang out since Saturday was a day off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was just my loner self’s opinion but, I think hanging out with a lot of people during that day had a lot of advantages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether it was high school, college, or work… We were all bound to socialize with different people throughout our lifetime. That was why establishing communication with a lot of people beforehand would make it easier for you to socialize with new people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take school for example. Whenever you advanced to a  higher grade, the first thing people would do was to look for their old acquaintances that came from their previous schools. Only after that, would they slowly mingle with the rest of the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if they didn’t get along with that said acquaintance back in their previous school, they would try to make it work. It’s easier to stick with those you know, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, then again, I’m a loner, it’s not like I have much experience. Most things I knew on the subject are hearsay. But… I guess that still made me worry about Asanagi’s social life.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it okay for her to hang out with me so often? What about her other friends?’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> That kind of thought had been nagging at me for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I didn’t have any problem with it personally. In the first place, she was the reason why I tried my hardest to keep my schedule free on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mind hanging out with her. Being with her felt so fun and I wouldn’t mind if she came to hang out with me every week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm? What is it? You’ve been staring at me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my gaze, Asanagi tilted her head. With fries in her right hand and a controller in her left, she wasn’t exactly what you would consider a classy look. But, she’s still a beautiful girl, so it still ends up looking picturesque somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I get it. You’re starting to fall in love with me, aren’t you? Then, why don’t you go easy on me and–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My ass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, t-this jackass, you’re shooting me? Stop hiding and face me like a man, you coward!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up. Learn to hide better, I’m actually worried about your lack of skills.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t need to worry about me, I’m still physically stronger than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What does that have to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I decided to talk to Asanagi about the thing that had been bothering me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, in the end, what I wanted to ask was, ‘Shouldn’t you hang out with other people more?’, and as soon as she heard this question, her face instantly soured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Do you actually hate hanging out with me? You’ve had enough of me, is that it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, to me, Asanagi, you’re…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My true feelings almost leaked out, but I managed to stop myself. However, Asanagi had always been pretty sharp, so she noticed and started to tease me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I messed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm ~ Hmm ~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? No ~ thing? I was wondering what our dear Maehara had to say about me? ‘To me, Asanagi, you’re…’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? I am what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ora!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While she was distracted, I shot her in-game avatar mercilessly with my rifle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, hey! Doing that when I was distracted… You coward!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All is fair in love and war!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to derail our conversation and turned her focus back to the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though Asanagi was still weak, she’s improved a lot, compared to when she first started. When I asked her about it, she told me that her brother had the same game in his collection and she had been practicing on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that explains why she started using gamer lingo whenever we were chatting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was on her way to becoming a real gamer… Or rather, she probably had become one when I wasn’t looking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I know that you’re just worried about me, so thank you for that, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mmm. I feel like I’m worrying about something I shouldn’t… My bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s okay. It’s true that I’ve been coming a lot lately. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and being here feels comfortable. Well, I do still need to be careful next week since there is that matter with Yuu… Anyways, what should we get for next week? There’s this okonomiyaki place I’ve had my eyes on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, how did the conversation derail this far?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation veered far from the main topic, but this was Asanagi, I’m sure that was merely my needless worry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it’s her life, she’s free to do whatever she likes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Right! The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> you lent me before was good… You know, the one with amazing art and story, what was it again…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, ‘Saw-Man’? The last volume of that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> got released yesterday, I bought it already.” (T/N: Chainsaw Man ofc)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, really? Why didn’t you tell me? Where is it? Is it in your room? Let me read it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, but I haven’t even read it yet…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, read it with me! Forget about those soggy fries, c’mon, let’s go to your room!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were the one who ordered these fries…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, we stopped playing video games and went to my room to read some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom worked as an editor, that was why my bookshelf was filled with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">light novels, and various other books. Whenever I wasn’t in the mood to play games, I would lie down in my room and read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, let me sit next to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finding the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">we were looking for, we both sat down on my bed and started reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the final volume of a popular series and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> was in production as we speak. We enjoyed it quite a lot, so both of us took our time and read through it panel by panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah… I didn’t expect that ending… When I first started, I thought this series was just some kind of nonsense, but then I kept going and got addicted, it was sick! Whenever the boys in our class started talking about it, I had to forcefully restrain my urge to join them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right? You don’t know how many times I tried to restrain myself from joining them in the middle of their conversation.”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/R0Sg7w7/001155.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I were the type of people who loved to discuss our favorite works. We would look for the subtleties in the work, plot holes, and any other things that we found interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard from Asanagi that whenever she went with Amami-san and the other classmates to see a movie, they only ever talked about basic things like how the graphics looked cool, or how the music sounded amazing. The conversation never reached the depths of our usual conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was one of the reasons why Asanagi thought of me as her ‘kindred spirit’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… That was fun… I’m gonna read it from the beginning. Where’s the first volume, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not in that bookshelf, the other one… Well, I guess I’ll read the other one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, each of us laid down on the bed or leaned against the wall as we spent our time reading quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence wasn’t awkward for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we weren’t unfamiliar with this silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… It’s been a while since I read that much…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a short break after the long reading session, only to realize that more than two hours had flown by. Lately, I found myself losing track of the time whenever I played games or read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should make some coffee. Asanagi, you want some cof–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to call Asanagi out, who was laying down in my bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zzz…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Is she sleeping…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked closer into her face, I found out that she had indeed fallen asleep. Even her mouth was half-open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, she was snoring. Seriously, falling asleep like this is fine and all, but isn’t she too defenseless?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she even realize that she is still inside my room?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zzz…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, aren’t you a girl…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, somehow she still looked adorable. Is it a perk of being a beauty?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘God, I wish my face looked as good as her… Well, whatever…’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to stop thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yawn</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Looking at her makes me feel sleepy too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She usually went back home an hour from now, so it should be okay to let her sleep for a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled the blanket over her before setting an alarm and laid down on the floor. With the cushion as my pillow, I decided to take a short nap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maki, wake up.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was having a pleasant nap when I heard someone’s voice echoing through my hazy consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The alarm hadn’t gone off yet, so it couldn’t have been that long since I started napping… Maybe Asanagi woke up already? …In that case, I need to escort her to the front door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki. Maki, wake up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Asanagi, I also fell asleep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, so that girl’s name is Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes and turned around, I saw Asanagi still sleeping peacefully in my bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, she was still sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that’s the case, then the one who called me would be…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly turned my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got off work early for the first time in a while… And I see you brought a girl home, hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mom…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing in front of me was Maehara Masaki. The person who was supposed to be at work at this hour. My mom.</span></p>
