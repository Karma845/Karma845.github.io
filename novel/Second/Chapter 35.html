<h3>Chapter 45 &#8211; The Changes in Class</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I got closer to Amami-san, things at school had been changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This happened when I arrived at school with my usual loner atmosphere while blending with the crowd of students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oh, yo, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?! Eh? What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a boy classmate who called out to me as we both passed by each other. He was one of the more popular boys in the class, part of a group different from Amami-san and the others, the jocks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I recall correctly, his name was Seki-kun. He was a head taller than me and he had this typical jock look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the first time that a boy other than Ooyama-kun ever called out to me in the half a year I’ve been in this class. That was why I overreacted a little there, it was that surprising for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, what’s wrong? It’s just a greeting, and we’re classmates, no need to be so worked up like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right… Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ou.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m going to the bathroom, see you.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> He said as he walked out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was that…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Maehara-kun. You talked with Seki-kun just now, right? What’s up with him?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooyama-kun… Don’t ask me, I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Seki-kun said earlier, it’s not unnatural for classmates to greet each other like that, but that’s not the point here. He greeted me, acted like we’ve been friends for life when we’ve never even spoken a word to each other prior to this, it’s reasonable for me to be surprised, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, what’s going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s Maki-kun! Good morning, Maki-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Goo–oof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right before I was about to take my seat after exchanging a few words with Ooyama-kun, a pleasant-sounding voice entered my ears as a strong force pushed me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sorry! When I entered the classroom, I saw Maki-kun’s back, so I got excited and did it without thinking…. Please forgive me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san… No, it’s fine, I don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around to see Amami-san’s angel-like smile. I guess this is around the time she arrived as well, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ei!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyah! U-Umi! What’s with you all of a sudden?! You’re going to give me a heart attack!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m only mimicking you ~ Seriously, Yuu, running up whenever you see someone you recognize like that, what are you, a puppy? Wait, you are one, my cute puppy ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And of course, Asanagi was coming up from behind her, pulling her away from me after she jumped up on her. This right here is the cooler Asanagi, different from the one usually hanging out in my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Good morning, Asanagi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Morning. Okay, okay, Yuu-chan, let’s end our morning walk here and go home ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez! Stop treating me like a puppy! See you at lunch, Maki-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Yes&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san was dragged to her seat by Asanagi. Apparently, she’ll be coming again on lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure we can talk casually now because we’re pretty much friends at this point, but I hope she could restrain herself for a bit. If we look too chummy together out in the open like this, the other classmates will start gossiping about us again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">See, they’ve started talking–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was ready to be hurled by their insults like usual, but I noticed something strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing was actually happening. I felt some gazes on me, but that was it, no insult, no talking behind my back, nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell is going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took up my phone and sent a message to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: The class atmosphere is unusual, what’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Why are you asking me? I don’t know.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Did Amami-san do something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I doubt it. Yuu isn’t the kind of person to manipulate other people.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Then, did they find out that we three had been hanging out?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Guess so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: So, that’s why Seki-kun talked to me earlier, huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Seki? Ah, I see, that’s why.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: ? Do you know something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Ah, right, Maehara doesn’t know…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Hm?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: He’s trying to get closer to Yuu, so, he’s probably trying to gain her attention by talking to you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Ah, I see now…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi secretly exchanged texts with me while talking with both Amami-san and Nitta-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything made more sense now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess some of our classmates were aware that Amami-san and I were starting to get along better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of that, there would be a possibility that if they were to show their displeasure about me openly, it would bring forth Amami-san’s ire on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You see, Amami-san was one of the centers of the class, well-liked by both boys and girls, so antagonizing her would bring nothing but trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, they were merely amused by our interaction. I mean, the cutest girl in class and the gloomy loner? Of course, that combination is amusing to gossip about. But since they noticed that we actually got along, they couldn’t just treat our relationship like a fun pastime anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the reason why Seki-kun, who was secretly interested in Amami-san (though, Asanagi and the other girls noticed his feeling, so much for a secret), made the first move to show that he got along decently well with me even though it was just a farce. My other perceptive classmates also followed Seki-kun’s lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why the atmosphere in the class suddenly changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And soon, it became clear that their decision wasn’t wrong.</span></p>
