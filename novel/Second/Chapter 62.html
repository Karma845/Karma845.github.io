<h3>Chapter 62 &#8211; From Now On (3)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was during the winter of my third year of middle school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was around Christmas when my parents divorced. I remember that it was snowy when it happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for the divorce was that they had some kind of conflict with each other. It wasn’t an affair or anything, though I haven’t asked them the details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents didn’t get along badly, on the contrary, they got along really well. My dad was a busy man, he left early in the morning and came back late at night. He always treated mom well whenever he came back though, and he always took care of me whenever he had the time to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why even though I had no friends, I never felt lonely. Both my parents were there for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My parents always seemed happy and our house was filled with joy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, things changed when dad received a promotion and he got even busier than he already was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were times when he was so busy that he couldn’t return home. He was young and he got his promotion early, which was why he had to show his sincerity by working even harder than before, that I understood.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m going to work hard so the both of you can take it easy.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I remember his words as he patted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both me and my mom supported his decision. We couldn’t see him often, but we decided to be patient for his sake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, that was probably the first trigger for their divorce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stuck between his family and his job. At first, both of them were thinking that they were doing everything for the sake of each other, but because being apart for extended periods, the trust between them gradually disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before they knew it, their love for each other turned into something else entirely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last memory I had of my family was when both my parents were signing their divorce papers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, it isn’t much, but that’s my story. Both mom and I were devastated for a while, but we are doing better now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;And your father?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven’t seen him lately, but he still occasionally contacts me. Maybe I’ll see him again on New Year’s Eve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know the details about things like money and such, but my mom said that he sent some money to a bank account under my name for my tuition every month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, that’s why I don’t really want to use words like ‘I love you’ or ‘I will never betray you’ like that. Words are cheap. I might love you now, but who knows what the future holds? That feeling might change over time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve seen a living example of that after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that I’m an indecisive person. That’s why I can’t comfort her with sweet words like she expected me to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, if I could, I would have nailed myself a girlfriend or two already, or at least made some friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn’t, that’s why I’m like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why, instead of doing that, I’ll wait. You’re feeling anxious about being my lover, so I will do my best to treat you well as a friend and erase that anxiety of yours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think that’s my best option here…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed to the floor of my house and told her,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, next week, I’ll be waiting for you here, in this house. Of course, you’re free to do whatever you want, but if you need me, I’ll be here for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing to do the things that I’ve always done for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the best answer I could give to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Maki…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, you’re a troublesome man.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well of course. I’ve been a loner for all my life, there’s a reason for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, honestly… What the hell are you thinking…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, she let out a chuckle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression right now was the best I’ve ever seen from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, I get it. So the question of whether we should be lovers or not will be put on hold, alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. Like I said, I’ll wait for you, so take your time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, sorry for being such a pain in the ass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, that’s the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I know, I’m used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you suddenly calling me by my family name? Maki, that’s just too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, we’re just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">friends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not a reason to suddenly act distant. This is why you’re a loner, you keep distancing yourself from other people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who cares? I’m fine as long as you’re here with me, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s… W-well, I’m happy to hear that, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face suddenly turned red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what Amami-san would think if she were to see us right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our idiotic couple act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, jeez! Let’s stop talking about this! Who cares if we’re lovers or not? We should just do things at our own pace! That’s fine with you right, Maki?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ah… yeah, sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, it’s settled! That’s what we’ll do from now on! Anyway, let’s play another round! Turn the game on, Maki! I’m going to win today!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, sure…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we decided to go back to our routine, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s hard for me to play if you’re clinging to me like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like doing it, got a problem?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Nope…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stayed like that until she had to go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that this probably wasn’t the right thing to do and since we liked each other, we’ll have to step out of our comfort zone eventually so that we could officially become lovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for now, I think it’s fine for us to live our life happily like this for a while longer.</span></p>
