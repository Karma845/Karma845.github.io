<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Bumping Into Each Other</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The horse race thing worried me at first, but after that mess was over, I did enjoy the non-gambling-related games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, take care of that zombie for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? What are you saying so suddenly… Ugh, this guy… Oraoraoraora…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In consideration of me, Asanagi took me to play a shooter game with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a while for me to get used to it since I’ve never played it before, but once I got used to it, I managed to deal with the enemies without losing any of my lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shooting things with a gun like this is fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Second place, huh? I guess my mistakes at the start were impactful after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, it’s your first time playing and you got into the ranking list, that’s amazing enough already. Whenever I played this with our classmates, we always got done in before we could even clear it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Asanagi, once more?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Sure, fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally I planned to only play it for one round, but that one round felt more like a warm-up than anything, so I decided to go for another round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, we were only playing for fun, but I was quite a competitive person, so I had to take it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you having fun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I guess… you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi mimicked my tone while grinning from ear to ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mock me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not, I’m just telling you the truth. Hey, focus, the enemy is coming.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said as she held up her gun and aimed it toward the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urk…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was just going along with whatever Asanagi wanted, but now, I feel like I’m the one who’s pulling her around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before coming here, I always thought that this place was just an idiotic, noisy place, but now that I’m here with Asanagi, I find myself enjoying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guess you gotta experience it by yourself before you could judge it, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ORA!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clank!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we were done with the shooting game, we went to the batting cage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi decided to show me the ropes, so we went to the 120km/h speed pitching machine. That speed should be quite difficult for a girl to handle, but Asanagi proved me wrong and was able to hit the ball with amazing accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You weren’t lying when you said you’re good at physical activities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! I’ve been hanging out with Yuu since I was little. Besides, I need to get some exercise every once in a while.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi, her sweat trickling down her forehead, came over with a satisfied look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was still wearing her oversized hoodie and jeans, but I could tell from her figure that she was in good shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she slacked off occasionally, she probably did enough to stay fit. No wonder she could accompany Amami-san as the center of the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since I hit a home run, I got a bonus round, so, here, Maehara, your turn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi held the bat out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. You have to exercise once in a while too, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I’ve never even held a baseball bat before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only have I never played baseball, I’m also bad at sports in general. Hitting the ball with this bat might be a pipe dream for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, no need to be embarrassed if you can’t hit it, I won’t laugh at you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There you go with your ‘I won’t laugh at you’ again. Stop saying words that you didn’t mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, just do your best. If you hit it, I will buy you juice, okay? …Ah, bunting is a no go, got it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, like she said, I’ll just treat it as exercise and be done with it. There are no other people around, so all is good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the bat and helmet from Asanagi and stepped into the batter box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pitch’s speed would be 120km/h, the same as Asanagi’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi told me that I could lower it, but since Asanagi did it at this speed, I should be able to do it too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoosh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t look this fast from outside, but when I got into the batter’s box, the speed of the ball surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So 120km/h was this fast…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, Maehara, you scaredy-cat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m not scared, shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmed my mind and took on the second pitch… This time I swung my bat, but it missed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoosh, the bat caught nothing but air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, watch the ball carefully first. Aim carefully, predict the ball’s trajectory, and intercept it with the bat. Don’t think about doing something ridiculous like getting a home run, just think about hitting it first!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swung the bat on the third and fourth pitches following Asanagi’s advice, but I failed them both and got a strikeout instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While everyone else in other boxes was hitting the ball, I got strike after strike instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, it’s okay. Your aim is getting better and better with each pitch, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for the encouragement, but can you stop rubbing salt on my wound? Isn’t this just a game?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I mean, Maehara, you look so pathetic right now, I figured I’d give you a word of encouragement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such a dick…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, leave it at that and just do your best! There are still three pitches left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed Asanagi’s advice and only thought about hitting the ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aim carefully… and intercept the ball’s trajectory with the bat…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clink!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I hit it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh! The ball’s direction is wrong, but good job!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rubbed the bat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, I got this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clink!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh! That was close!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hit it and the ball went down, but I felt like I could hit it properly next time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just needed a little bit more power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the last pitch, Maehara!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last pitch, the conditions were the same as the previous pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aim carefully… and swing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Asanagi’s advice in the back of my head and her cheering behind me, I swung the bat and hit the ball as hard as I could…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you go, good work out there ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After using up all the tokens, Asanagi and I were sitting on the couch in the resting area while drinking juice that Asanagi bought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The batting result was, well, the ball went forward, but my swing was weak, it didn’t even reach the machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next time, I’ll hit a home run.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, someone’s fired up. Sure, I’ll look forward to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a while since I’ve moved my body like this, so I was struggling to catch my breath. But strangely, it didn’t feel unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know if it’s because of the games or the fact that I’m with Asanagi, but everything feels fun. I enjoyed myself enough that I would love to come back here again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe next time, I will come here alone… Well, if the place is less crowded, that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s almost time to go home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right… Ah, I need to go to the toilet first, hold this for me and wait for me outside, okay, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi left her bag with me and went to the toilet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it okay to leave this to me? Isn’t the content of this bag important to her? Well, I’m glad that she trusts me enough to have me hold on to her bag, but still…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thinking back, I never expected that I would get along with Asanagi so well…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself I stared blankly at the group who was playing a game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The loner me and one of the centers of the class, Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we were living our lives normally, we would never have gotten along, but now, we were connected with a strong bond of friendship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a while since I first introduced myself to the class, the introduction that I thought went horribly wrong, but because of that introduction, the ‘second cutest girl in class’ came into my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She taught me how to be brave and how to not feel embarrassed at my own failure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people called ‘loners’ were originally the people who were sensitive toward other people’s impressions of them. They didn’t want to be ridiculed by people, they couldn’t stand the embarrassment, that was why they tried so hard not to fail. But because of that, they became hesitant to take a step forward when the opportunity presented itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my case, even when there was someone I wanted to be friends with or someone that I liked, the fear of failure prevented me from taking action. That was why I’ve always been alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, thanks to that failure, I was able to befriend Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I previously failed, that didn’t mean it was the end of the road. Rather, it would open up another path that I couldn’t previously walk… I think Asanagi taught me that…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now… it should be about time for Asanagi to be done with her business… Let’s get outta here…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I stood up from the bench while carrying Asanagi’s bag on my shoulder…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Is that you, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it’s really Maehara-kun! Hey ~ Maehara-kun ~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the girls from that group I was looking at approached me while waving cheerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a familiar uniform. I could recognize her even in this dimly lit place. She was the last person I wished to meet today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Amami-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it’s your classmate, Amami ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her angelic smile, Amami-san stood right in front of me.</span></p>
