<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; Our Parents Found Out</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my fault for being careless, but I never would’ve thought that my mom would find out about our relationship before Amami-san did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Asanagi. I was planning to wake you up earlier…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… It’s fine ~ I mean, we were both knocked out, so, we’re both equally guilty. If your mom didn’t wake us up, we probably would’ve slept until morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was right. By the time my mom woke me up, it was way past midnight. Asanagi’s house didn’t have a curfew, but she always called ahead to let her parents know if she were to come back late, and since she didn’t, her parents must be very worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it seemed like those two fell asleep while reading manga… We’re sorry for the inconvenience… Yes… Yes? No, no… My son is also guilty–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Asanagi and I were sitting on the floor, my mom was contacting Asanagi’s parents. She was bowing with an apologetic expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of this incident, both our parents now knew that their children got along well with a classmate of the opposite gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did plan to introduce Asanagi to my mom later, but… Not like this… This is literally the worst way for her to learn about Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for the wait, Umi-chan. Since it’s already this late, your mother is letting you stay over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-ehh? W-wouldn’t I become a bother then? Besides, Mae… no, Maki-kun is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. No matter how well we got along, we were still of the opposite genders. It was normal for us to worry about this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Even if your house is close by, we can’t let a girl walk home alone in the middle of the night. I think we both know that my son over here is a little bit unreliable in that regard too, right? Of course, I’ll make sure that he won&#8217;t lay a finger on you tonight, so you don’t need to worry, Umi-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t touch her. I mean, even when we fell asleep, she was sleeping on the bed while I laid down on the floor by myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You say that, but didn’t you take a peek at her sleeping face and touch her cheeks?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way in hell I did that. We aren’t in that kind of relationship… C’mon mom, have a little faith in your son.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though her speculation was kind of correct. I didn’t touch her cheeks, but I did take a peek at her face. Of course, I regretted nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, to think that Maki is bringing a cute girl home… Even though he only ever holed up inside the house and played video games. Maki, since when have you been getting along with Umi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you badmouthing me like that? &#8230;Uh, well… It&#8217;s been about two months now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technically I hadn&#8217;t brought anyone home. She initially came uninvited. But, I’m a gentleman, so I’ll bear with it and take the L here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. So that’s why the house smells like deodorant lately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My previous excuse was to erase the garlic smell from the pizza I ordered, but in truth, it was to camouflage Asanagi’s presence in the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if it was her perfume or make-up, but whenever she left, there was always a faint sweet smell that lingered inside the house, and since mom’s nose was fairly sensitive, I tried my best to hide it from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in the end, all that effort became meaningless because of this incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, since your mother already gave her permission, you should stay over tonight, Umi-chan. But make sure to go home tomorrow morning and apologize to your mother properly, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, don’t worry too much about it, okay? You’re not a bother and I won’t do anything to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also have to go to her house and apologize to her parents tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… you really won’t do anything to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, what kind of jerk do you think I am?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Well, if you had the balls to actually do that, we would’ve never been friends to begin with… Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was reluctant at first, but it seemed like we managed to convince her as she nodded her head a few times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright then. I’ll be in your care for the night…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t mind it, Umi-chan. Anyway, you should use my nightwear so your uniform won’t get wrinkled… Ah, right, what about taking a bath first? After that, we can have a little talk… Maki, go to your room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got it, jeez.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew she was angry at me, but she could still act sweetly in front of Asanagi. Actually, she looked really excited for some reason, it was unthinkable seeing as she just got back from overtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, this was the first time I ever brought a friend home, so she was probably curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, her excitement could also be from the fact that Asanagi was a beautiful girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that she had always wanted a daughter of her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, before I go back to my room, where would Asanagi sleep? There’s no way that we’ll be letting her sleep on the couch, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We didn’t have a guest room, so the only other place to sleep would be in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? I don’t mind sleeping on the couch…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Umi-chan. You won’t be able to sleep well there and you’ll wake up with back pain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, the only place left would be…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi glanced at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were only two rooms in this house, mine and my mom’s. Since mom would sleep in her room, then the only other place she could sleep in would be my room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I’ll take the couch tonight, and you take my bed. After you’re done bathing, just give my room a knock, got it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, Maehara, you–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t sweat it, I could sleep on the floor just fine, so sleeping on the couch should be no problem for me. Don’t worry about it and just make yourself at home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… Are you sure…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Also, I replaced the bedding recently, so it shouldn’t be dirty, so you don’t need to worry about hygiene.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She already slept on my bed not too long ago, why the hell is she making a fuss now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See, Maki gave his consent, no need to hold back, okay, Umi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, our time together will continue for a while longer.</span></p>
