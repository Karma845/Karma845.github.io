<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; The Talented Amami-san</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told both of them to stop playing and eat the pancakes while they were still hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was quite proud of these particular pancakes since they were my best creations so far. They were freshly made and fluffy, it was worth spending the time carefully whisking the eggs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I divided the pancakes equally into three portions before I told the two girls to taste them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah… It’s so fluffy! It isn’t as sweet as normal pancakes because of the banana, but the taste of bananas made up for it! And more importantly, it’s tasty!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mhm. Seriously, this is something…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This particular recipe is diet friendly, so you don’t need to worry about your caloric intake even if you add more butter and syrup… Speaking of which, do you two want more butter and syrup?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, just a bit…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They enjoyed the pancake, huh? I’m glad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san cheerfully ate the pancake while Asanagi groaned in resignation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was amusing how different their expressions were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I need to thank Asanagi. Because of her efforts, we could enjoy our time together like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki-kun… Uhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san fidgeted. It seemed like she had already finished her portion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… I only made enough for three people, but there’s still some batter left, I can make more if you want it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then I want more, please!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger… What about you, Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aaah… Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, she had just licked her plate clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Pardon me, may I have some too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Maki-kun, can I watch you while you’re making it? I want to make it at home too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can just ask your mom to make it for you, right? I mean, you’ll just end up making black disks if you try anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu! I’m sure I can make it if Maki-kun teaches me everything properly! I’ll be in your care, Maki-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, as long as you are mindful of the timing of each step, I’m sure you’ll be alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, can I join in…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I was sandwiched between Asanagi and Amami-san as they watched me making the pancake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After you make the batter, just pour it into the frying pan, cover it, and let it cook for five minutes or so. You can judge whether it’s done or not by the look of the pancake. If it looks fluffy enough, then it’s ready.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh! It looks so easy!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you aren’t sure, you can always look up recipes on the internet. All you need to pay attention to is the timing. Timing is everything here. If you do it right, you’ll be able to avoid something like accidentally burning the pancake…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? You want to diss me because I could only make dark matter and charcoal? Sure, go ahead, say it to my face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, stop assuming things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking advantage of Amami-san’s blindspot, Asanagi pinched my side. She was showing her mercy because Amami-san was here since it didn’t really hurt. I guess I unintentionally hurt her pride there, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we ate everything and went back to play the game they previously paused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, watch me, Umi! With Maki-kun’s help, I’m now stronger than ever! I’ll beat you down this time!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“With that unpractical-looking avatar? Hah! Look at my avatar, it’s filled with practical equipment and first-class weapons! Beating me? In your dreams!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this mode they were playing, they could customize their avatar as much as they liked. Amami-san made her avatar look cute while Asanagi just copied mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of this, Amami-san was at a disadvantage whether it was in terms of experience or raw stats, she needed to compensate for this with her raw skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s see… The most important thing for you to take note of is to not panic and aim properly whenever you spot an enemy. always try to look for high ground or any place that could give you a terrain advantage…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat next to Amami-san while giving her advice occasionally while she was playing against Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of it immediately showed itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay calm… Aim carefully… There!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! Yay! First blood!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took her only ten minutes to apply every piece of advice that I gave her. She executed everything perfectly and managed to gain a huge momentum against Asanagi who had been in the lead ever since they started playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi had been practicing at her home and with me so she was by no means a pushover, but the move that Amami-san managed to execute was brilliant. The way she executed it was better than any attempts I’ve ever made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She said she rarely played this kind of game. I guess she is just talented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sigh… Well, I was careless, that won’t happen again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe ~ Then, bring it on, Umi! Use your serious mode!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I no longer had any advice to give her after that, I decided to just watch the two of them play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-this is!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, here! I’m here, Umi-chan! Eat this ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This guy… I’ll kill you!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle was unexpectedly heated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We played for another hour before stopping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t the usual time when Asanagi and I stopped playing, but since Amami-san was also with us, we decided it was better for us to stop earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially since the previous incident was still fresh in our minds, we couldn’t let our guard down just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu… I only managed to win three times after that… Agh! So frustrating!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m surprised you could snatch a win at all. You’re a complete beginner not too long ago, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Asanagi said, it was surprising that she could win a few games against her since experience and raw skill were the most important thing in this game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure I gave her some advice, but Amami-san was still a beginner, and she hadn&#8217;t even touched the controller prior to this. But she still managed to snatch a few games from Asanagi, who was pretty much addicted to this game ever since she got beaten by me months ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, Maki-kun, see you later ~ Let’s play together again sometime!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sure, see you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before this, I always hoped that this would be the last time I had to deal with her, but now, I couldn’t say I hate this. Hanging out with those two was fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, since we had something in common now, it would be less awkward for us to converse with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What’s wrong, Umi? Let’s go back already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry… Uhm, I forgot something… You should go ahead, Yuu, I’ll catch up with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? I don’t mind waiting… I can accompany you even.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, it’s fine. Besides, you already wore your shoes, no? It would be a pain to take it off, so, just go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Well, I’m going ahead then!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi pushed Amami-san out of the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, we both were alone inside this house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously, that girl. She could do anything if she put her mind to it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re talking about the game? Yeah, she is pretty good, but it isn’t that hard to get to that level if you put in some effort.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah sure, that’s all she could do today because she just started playing, but give her time and she’ll get better and better. She absorbs everything like a sponge, and before you know it, she’ll surpass you and leave you behind…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m sorry for venting out of the blue like that… It’s just, well, I just think that girl is amazing in a lot of ways…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see… Well, I know where you’re coming from.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People like Amami-san do exist in this world. Talented people who would be able to do everything well after only a brief introduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of being talented, Amami-san herself was well-liked by everyone. As her best friend who always stayed by her side, it wouldn’t be strange for Asanagi to feel a bit of envy toward her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, at least you understand… See you, Maehara… Today was fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, it was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bye.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi left through the door while waving her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you thought today was fun, why did you look so gloomy, idiot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her back when she was leaving looked gloomy.</span></p>
