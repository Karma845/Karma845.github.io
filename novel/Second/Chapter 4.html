<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Keeping Secret </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was another Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s it for today. Remember, don’t play too much just because it’s the weekend! Midterm exams are coming up soon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell rang, signaling the end of the class, and my classmates began to move in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some went home immediately, some went to their club activities and some stayed in the classroom to discuss their plans for fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you next week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying goodbye to Ooyama, I immediately left my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I didn’t have anything else to do at school, of course, I would go back home immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before I passed through the door, I glanced at the group that Asanagi-san was in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe ~ Hey, hey, Umi ~ Let’s go somewhere today ~ Everyone said they want to do karaoke with the rest of the class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Sorry, Yuu, I have something to do today, so I have to go back home right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, again?? Why is it so hard to hang out with you lately? Boo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m only busy on Fridays, not the whole weekend. Besides, aren’t we practically inseparable every other day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true, but I want to be with Umi every single day!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-san was spoiling Amami-san as if she was a puppy. In other words, their usual antics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They started doing this ever since Asanagi-san started hanging out with me on Fridays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since today was Friday, we promised to hang out at my place like usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, we would play games together, but today we were planning to watch a movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for what kind of movie, Asanagi-san would be picking it, so I’ll have to wait to find out what we’re watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyways, I’m busy today so I’ll hang out with you tomorrow and the day after, so just be patient, alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo… I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever she had plans to hang out with me, she would always try to refuse Amami-san’s invitation like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that Asanagi-san and I should keep our friendship a secret from the rest of the class. I proposed this to Asanagi-san and she agreed to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as we were concerned, Asanagi-san and I were just friends, but other people might think otherwise. There were those that loved to “ship” certain couples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, even though Amami-san overshadowed her, Asanagi-san was still quite cute. If someone were to find out that we got along this well, they might start some unnecessary trouble. And I’d rather not deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: Sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: I might be late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara]: It’s fine, don’t worry about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: So…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: What’s for dinner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara]: Fried chicken, hamburger, fries. No salad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: Neat ~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After exchanging messages with her in secret, I tried to leave the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there’s no smoke, there won’t be a fire. But in my case, I&#8217;m holding quite a strong spark, so I need to be careful, else I start a fire that I’d have no chance of extinguishing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, so… What should I get for today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier this morning, I took the 2000 yen that mom left on the table and put it in my pocket, wondering what I should eat with Asanagi-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself actually enjoying this, which was kind of out of character for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: Ah…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: Right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara]: What’s up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: I haven’t told you the genre of today’s movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara]: Mmm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi-san]: Shark movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara]: Shark movie?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why shark movie? When talking about shark movies, I could only imagine man-eating sharks randomly attacking people swimming in the ocean, blood spraying everywhere… Does she love that kind of B-movie?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi… The thing you have to do… Is it a family matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, what about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing ~ It’s just that I smell something fishy from you ~ Why does your voice sound bouncy I wonder~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-san and I had never talked with each other in class before, so we shouldn’t have roused Amami-san’s suspicion, but she’s surprisingly sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Does it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Asanagi-san didn’t fall for it and instead replied to her calmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Yuu, do you actually want to go to my home and say hello to my brother? Well, I’ll notify him then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah yeah, I wonder how long has it been since the last time Yuu met my brother? Since 1st year of middle school? I’m sure that he’ll be happy if he knows that you’re coming ~ Who knows, maybe he’ll even crawl up to you ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uee…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know that Asanagi-san had an older brother, but it seemed like he had quite the personality. It was to the point that Amami-san was wincing like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So? What will you do? Come over to my house, or just call it quits for today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’ll call it quits…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Too bad ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugghh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Asanagi-san. Not only did she deal with the situation calmly, she even pulled out the uno reverse card on Amami-san. Also, it was refreshing seeing her telling such a brazen lie with a straight face like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomorrow then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, I promise I’ll make up for it properly, okay, Princess Yuu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we previously agreed to not tell anyone about our friendship, I think it would be fine if Asanagi-san just told Amami-san the truth, but well, I’ll leave it to her judgment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Asanagi-san seemed to be in a good mood.</span></p>
