<h3>Chapter 53 &#8211; Different Than Normal</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cultural festival ended a few days ago. Since then, the temperature had dropped significantly. Mornings became noticeably colder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few days ago, the weather was warm enough for us to wear light clothes, but that isn’t the case anymore. The weather forecast had been showing us the first signs of winter and according to them, the temperature would drop even further as the days passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maki, the AC stopped working. What should we do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was early in the morning after I washed my face and entered the living room. There, my mom greeted me, wrapped in a blanket like a caterpillar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the heater? Isn’t it in your closet, mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I tried turning it on last night, but apparently that one is broken too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What perfect timing. Of course things broke down when we needed it the most, it was the law of nature at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes, I wondered why these things happened, but I realized that such questions were pointless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, my mother and I decided to send the AC away to be repaired later. I went to the school quickly afterwards. No point in loitering around the house when I could just do that at school where it would be way warmer. The AC at school should be perfectly functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki, here’s your money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was Friday, she gave me money for dinner as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh, three thousand yen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me an extra thousand for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Aren’t you going to bring Umi-chan home again today? You’ll need at least that much, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not something a parent should say– Whatever, two thousand is enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Both of you eat a lot, right? Two thousand isn’t enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I still don’t need it, she won’t be coming today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Did something happen? Did you two break up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What? …No, we didn’t. We aren’t fighting either, we’re still talking with each other normally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Circumstances…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sound so cheeky.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly left out the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As cheeky as it would sound, this was the decision of both Asanagi and I.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I had to do my part and follow through with it properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, good morning, Maehara-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? G-good morning, sensei.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to quietly walk past the school gate as usual, but suddenly the teacher in charge of greeting the student called me by my name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised because my name was called so suddenly, but considering what happened back at the festival, of course the teacher would remember my name and face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, ‘Main Character’. You’re earlier than usual today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was too cold at home… Wait, stop calling me that. I was about to forget about it, but you just had to bring it up, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to enter the classroom, Seki-kun approached me. Apparently he had to practice this early in the morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Maehara. Do you have the pictures we took the other day? Nitta gave them to me, but I accidentally deleted them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah I do… Here you go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled out my phone and sent him the pictures that he was looking for. We exchanged contacts when we were cleaning up after the festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the images I sent was taken on the morning of the festival, the one with the mosaic in the background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This one was fine, but the other picture I sent was a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha Maehara, you look so tense in this one, it’s funny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me a break, it was my first time going through all that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a picture of me wearing the ‘Main Character’ sash while receiving a certificate and a commemorative gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of the festival was, our exhibit took first place, beating out other classes’ projects. The art itself was good, but the main reason why we got as many votes as we got was because of a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">publisher. I previously sent them an email to notify them of our project and to our surprise, they went out of their way to share it over their official social media account. It was a pleasant surprise for all of us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though because of that, the rest of the class pushed me to the stage as the representative and made me receive our awards and stuff while wearing that goofy sash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Seriously, I wanted to bury myself in a hole somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, ever since I embarrassed myself out in the open like that, the environment inside the class had begun to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Good morning, Maki-kun! The weather is getting colder, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Mr. Representative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Amami-san, Nitta-san. Also, stop calling me that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, don’t sweat the small stuff~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since that day, my image as the ‘gloomy loner’ was gone and my classmates started trying to communicate with me actively. Compared to the unpleasant time back then when we were doing the lottery, I could say I prefer this kind of environment more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Where’s Asanagi? She didn’t come with you guys?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She overslept this morning, so I went ahead. She should be here soon though… Ah, there she is! Hey, Umi~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw Asanagi running toward us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… I made it in time… How much time is left?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Five minutes before class started, still quite some time left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever, the important thing is that I made it in time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She showed us a smug smile for some reason. Her uniform and the likes looked messy though, a clear sign that she was rushing to come here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Asanagi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, Asanagi and I greeted each other. Since we were paired up as the class representative for the committee, we decided to stop acting like a total stranger to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we still kept our friendship a secret from everyone except Amami-san though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, Umi, you got bed hair…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Really? I tidied up before I left my house though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe because you ran here, the wind messed up your hair, right, Maki-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… It does seem messy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san walked up to her and touched her disorderly bangs. Having to take care of your hair like this seemed like a pain in the ass. Thankfully my hair was short enough so that I didn’t need to go through this hurdle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll fix your hair, I got some hair conditioner with me. Ninacchi, help me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger~ Let’s go back to our seats then~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, you two…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three girls went to their seats while I walked toward mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Maehara-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Ooyama-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of things happened during the festival but Ooyama-kun still treated me like usual. He wasn’t trying to ignore me or anything, rather this was how our relationship worked, we maintained a proper distance from each other. It was Seki-kun and the others who were too touchy-feely with me for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, some things changed and some things stayed the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became a member of the committee for about a month. While I had my share of hardships and I ended up embarrassing myself publicly, I could say that overall, everything ended on a positive note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for one thing. I had to spend my weekends without Asanagi.</span></p>
