<h3>Chapter 41 &#8211; Weekend +1 (2)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um, sorry, can you give me a second?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the intercom and quickly went to Asanagi’s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yuu is here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. She’s still at the entrance though… By the way, when you left the house today did she, by any chance, see you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. No way I would get careless like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Amami-san’s house and Asanagi’s house were quite a distance away from each other, so it would be unlikely that she saw Asanagi leave her house by chance unless she camped somewhere nearby. But there was no way Amami-san would do that, she had no reason to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, she came here because she was convinced that Asanagi would be at my house today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This exact day, during this exact hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, have you told Amami-san about our relationship?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you haven’t?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry. There wasn’t a good enough time to bring the topic up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I were to blame her, it was too late already. Besides, she hadn’t really done anything wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, if Asanagi hadn’t told Amami-san about this, that meant at some point she noticed that we were unusually close with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to play dumb and try to fool her… No, that wouldn’t work. Knowing Amami-san, she would probably have double-checked it with Asanagi’s house before she even came here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess we had no other choice, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara… That… I’m sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I told you to hide it because I didn’t want to deal with the noise that other classmates would make. If we explain this properly to Amami-san, I’m sure she’ll understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she found out about our relationship, the best thing we could do is to explain properly. That way no one would be hurt more than they already were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you fine with this, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let Asanagi sit by the table and invited Amami-san in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air inside the house felt stifling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi could only turn her gaze away from Amami-san’s sharp gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their position was now reversed. Amami-san was now dominating Asanagi, who had a pitiful look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san, care for a drink?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, I’m going home after this. I don’t want to interrupt your precious time together any more than this… I’m sure you’d prefer it that way. Right, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, let me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I let the two of them talk in this kind of mood, the atmosphere would get worse than it already was. I had to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san, when did you notice?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just recently. But I had my suspicions for a few months now. I mean, Umi kept refusing my invitations and she kept using the same excuse, of course I would get suspicious from that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That early, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That should be around the time when we first befriended each other. I thought we were being extremely careful during that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guess we underestimated Amami-san a little too much, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know… Everyone in the class might disregard you both and keep their attention on me, but… I’ve always paid the closest attention to my best friend, Umi…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I got to know each other behind the other classmates’ backs. We used Amami-san’s reputation as the cutest girl in class as a cover because she was the only one that everyone paid attention to. After we got to know each other, we surprisingly hit it off pretty well. Since then, we started hanging out with each other every week. She even stayed over at my house once, and our parents even got acquainted with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi kept turning down Amami-san’s invitation, using ‘having work to do at home’ as an excuse. But in truth, she was hanging out with a classmate. I guess Amami-san felt left out because of this…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, why haven’t you told me anything about Maki-kun? I’ve been waiting, you know? I’ve been waiting for you to tell me, but you never did…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, Amami-san, I was the one who told her to not tell anyone. I didn’t  want the people in class to make a fuss about us, right, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, mhm… We wanted to keep it a secret for the time being…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no doubt that this mess started because of me. I was the one who told her to not tell anyone about our relationship. But why did Asanagi look so down?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my fault, why was she acting like it was her fault?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that she was actually enjoying keeping our relationship a secret? And now she felt guilty because of it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, is that true? Is Maki-kun telling me the truth?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a lie, Asanagi, why didn’t you answer her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, why aren’t you saying anything? Don’t you trust me? Is our relationship actually only one-sided? You’ve stopped thinking of me as your best friend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I still think of you as my best friend… even though I kept my relationship with Maehara a secret, you’re still my best friend, Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why didn’t you tell me about this right away? If you wanted to keep your relationship a secret from the rest of the class, I could keep my mouth shut, you just needed to ask…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">True. Also, we already decided that we should tell her about our relationship back when Asanagi stayed over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in the end, Asanagi didn’t tell her anything about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re right… If it’s you, you’d be able to keep a secret and prevent anyone from meddling with us…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why didn’t you?…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I can’t tell you why… I don’t want to tell you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi squeezed the hem of my shirt tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been wondering why she hadn&#8217;t told Amami-san about our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she had her own reason for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Maehara. It’s late already. Mom will be worried if I stay here any longer, so I’m going home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Umi, if you’re leaving, I’m going–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, you just arrived, so you should stay. Have some coffee first and relax or something. Sorry, I need some time alone… Also… I can’t bring myself to face you right now… Sorry&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a clear rejection from Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time that I’d seen a crack in the relationship between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Yuu… I’m the worst, aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Umi–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you later, Maehara. Thanks for inviting me today… It was a lot of fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi made a lonely smile before she stormed out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maki-kun… What should I do…? I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should we chase after her? Or should we leave her alone for now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know. I just don’t know…</span></p>
