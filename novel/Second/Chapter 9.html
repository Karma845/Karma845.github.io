<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; A Loner’s View on Relationships</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all that, I was fortunate enough to have another weekly gathering with Asanagi-san, so… I decided to apologize to her for eavesdropping on her confession the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that happened, huh? It’s fine, don’t worry about it. You just happened to be there and didn’t actually tail me, right? In that case, it was completely on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought her mood would worsen if I brought that up, but instead, she just dismissed it lightly as she ate the pudding she bought at the convenience store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t mind being asked out. The reason why I snuck out instead of announcing it to everyone was out of consideration for the other person… After all, someone might start unpleasant rumors between both of us, like Nitta from our class, she would do something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nitta would be… that girl you usually hang around with, right, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Well, I don’t know if she would gossip about me, but she did gossip about other people, as you could expect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I promised, I decided to hide the fact that I had run into Amami-san and Nitta-san there. It’s completely on them to decide what they would do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I also hid the fact that I got Amami-san’s phone number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, it’s Asanagi-san we are talking about, she would notice Amami-san’s antics easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if I should ask you this, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi… aren’t you rather popular?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… Well, not really? I’m not as popular as Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If getting confessed by five people in less than half a year was an average number (according to Nitta-san), then how many confessions did Amami-san get?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong? Are you jealous, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really… Well, I just thought that being popular sounds troublesome…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe it’s because I’m a loner?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if she asked me why I couldn’t really answer her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my case, I was bad enough at socializing that it was hard for me to ask my classmate to befriend me. I don’t think someone like me should shamelessly talk about matters concerning love and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try to explain it. Don’t worry, I’m not going to laugh at you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s the ‘I’m not going to laugh at you’ line&#8230; If anything, you’re just raising the hurdle for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, it’s fine, it’s fine. Just tell me what’s on your mind, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, even if she’s going to laugh at me, Asanagi’s the only one here, so it should be fine, I guess…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, to me, I can’t understand it, being popular and stuff. I mean, people will look up to you when you’re popular, right? They would try to get to know you better and somehow form a special relationship with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, that’s true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, being popular isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It proves that you have a special charm that attracts people, it’s better than attracting malice at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, being popular isn’t all sunshine and rainbows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Case and point, the boy who confessed to Asanagi-san the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are all kinds of people around you, including those you have no interest in and those you secretly hate… Dealing with those people would be troublesome, no? They don’t even care about you, so why must you be mindful of them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Asanagi-san had to be careful back then when she replied to that boy’s confession. Sure, they might be people who would straight up say, ‘I don’t like you’ or ‘You’re gross’ and dismiss such confessions outright, but Asanagi-san wasn’t one of them. Besides, it would create an unnecessary grudge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People’s emotions, their likes, and dislikes were tricky to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I think about it, I feel glad that I’m not popular. Sure, it’s hard to be a loner, but that means I don’t have to worry about such things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s quite a lonely thought.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Well, I guess that’s why I’m a loner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless I change this way of thinking, I will probably keep on leading this boring lifestyle for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been trying to find the courage to take a step forward but I always fell short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There, a loner’s perspective on relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. That sounds like what a virgin would say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oof.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That actually hurts. But she’s not wrong, so I can&#8217;t refute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t hate the loner Maehara, on the contrary, I like him. Of course, only as a ‘friend’, don’t misunderstand that, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. Me too, I like Asanagi, but, only as a ‘friend’, you shouldn’t misunderstand that either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? You’re saying something like that now? Acting cocky even though you are a virgin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You wanna go? Sure, I won’t hold back today, I’ll give you ten, no, a hundred rounds for you to beat me. I’ll make sure to turn you into swiss cheese.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m ready whenever. You’ll fall to my godly aim anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So cocky even though you just barely know how to play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I put an end to our relationship talk as we turned our gaze toward the game screen once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think this is more suitable for me than complicated things like other people’s likes and dislikes.</span></p>
