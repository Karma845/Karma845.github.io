<h3>Chapter 40 &#8211; Weekend +1 </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty minutes later, Asanagi came in wearing a hoodie, hat, jeans, and sneakers, the same outfit she wore back when we went to the arcade the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the second time I’d seen her dressed this way, but this girl really looked good in everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, welcome. I’ve ordered more food for you, you don’t mind the usual right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, thanks. Oh, right, your mom called me a while ago. She gave me the okay to beat you senseless if you try to lay your hands on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said that? And she called herself my mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I wouldn’t make the same mistake this time, so everything would be alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called her here when she was sleepy, so she might just fall asleep here again, but this time I’ll make sure to wake her up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Of course I won’t try to do anything weird when she’s sleeping. Not like I have the guts to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? What’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No~thing. I just got the urge to call your name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I let her in, Asanagi had been looking at me while grinning suspiciously. She did nothing more than that, but this was her way of teasing me. That phone call I made earlier really riled her up, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, she might keep doing this for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn, I knew I shouldn’t have called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My cheeks grew hotter by the second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm hmmm ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my feelings, Asanagi was humming while preparing dishes and glasses that she would use. She was in a good mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what made her so happy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s start working. Have you converted the image to mosaic art?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah, I only converted it though, I haven’t made any adjustments to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brought a chair from the living room and we started working side by side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, scoot over a little…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? A-ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The space was small, so we had to huddle up close to each other. Her face was so close to mine, but this wasn’t the time to be mindful about that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hey, Asanagi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know this place is cramped but, do you really have to cling to me like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? I’m not clinging to you, stop imagining things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why are you hugging my arm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you fussing so much when I’m giving you a little bit of service?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t need it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then, give me three thousands for the hug, also for breaking my heart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a ripoff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she chose physical contact as a viable way of teasing me today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her to stop hugging my arm because it got in the way of our work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, what color should we use for this part over here? Black? Red?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Black is too dark to put in there… Red is too bright… Maybe a darker shade of red or even purple would fit…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would Dr. Pepper color fit? No one’s selling Dr. Pepper around here though… Maybe we should order it online and ask Yagisawa-sensei to pay for it… Yeah, let’s do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Do it then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you making me do it, hm, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who else should do it? Anyway, we should refrain from buying anything unless we have no other choice. Well, I know a way to get more cans, so don’t worry about not having enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A way only Maehara, the loner, knows… No way! Is it through the black market?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Black market my butt. Anyway, it should be here soon…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even someone like me had a few connections you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time to prove my worth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The intercom rang at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pizza Rocket</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> here ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, here’s the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your patronage ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who came was the part-timer delivery lady who came to deliver our pizza. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know her name, but she was the person who always delivered my orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, excuse me, may I ask about something else? It’s unrelated to my order though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I negotiated with the delivery lady to let me pick up a few dozen empty cans from the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though the pizza shop was a chain store, they had a wider variety of drinks and side dishes than normal stores, so I was sure that there would be empty cans with the color that we needed. And that hunch of mine was correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nom… I guess that solved the empty cans problem. Ah, lemme have that chicken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi! You! Well, anyway, we still need to go to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Home Center</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and get the other things we need. I’m taking that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hash Brown</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! Didn’t your mom teach you to not take other people’s possession?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t your mom teach YOU to not take other people’s possession?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you on about? Are you implying that I took someone else’s possession?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not a politician, stop playing dumb.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I ate our food while stealing each other’s side dishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course this would normally be considered bad manners, but we stopped caring about manners a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might just be me, but the food always tasted better whenever we did this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for the food ~ Well, now that we’ve filled our stomachs…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We continue our work?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope. It’s time to play a game.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not the answer I expected, but sure, let’s do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were still some things that we needed to work on, but I could handle them by myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I felt glad that Asanagi came today… I hated to admit it, but embarrassing myself over the phone was well worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There! An opening!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha?! Oh no!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to beat the living hell out of her like usual, but she managed to snatch a win from me because of my carelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s go! I beat Maehara in his serious mode!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get cocky! You were just lucky!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I let my guard down, Asanagi made short work of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, rematch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? Hehehe… Fine, I’ll let you meet your maker once again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re getting carried away… I’ll beat you next time, just you wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah! I’ll be the one who wins next time! Two wins in a row, let’s do this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I managed to keep my dignity after that. I didn’t let her win a single time. But this girl had gotten even better than the last time she played with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she had been practicing really hard since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t have Amami-san’s monstrous talent, but she had the tenacity to make up for that through pure effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the virtue of the girl named Asanagi Umi, always working hard on everything she set her mind on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… Today was pretty fun… We have some time left, what do you want to do, Asanagi? Play another round or maybe watch a movie? It had been a while since we did that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah? …Mmm ~ Right…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my gaze toward her, she leaned on my shoulder, controller in hand. She looked sleepy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Near the end of our matches, she had been stumbling, I thought she was just distracted by something, but apparently she just had reached her limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to sleep?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah… I’m feeling kinda tired right now…” *</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yawn*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay then, take it easy and take the couch. I’ll wake you up later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… Lend me your blanket…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my blanket and put it on Asanagi, who was lying on the couch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe… This blanket feels warm… It’s chilly, the warmth feels perfect…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wrapped in the blanket from her neck to her toes, only her face was exposed. She looked like a bagworm. Also, the blanket was a cheap one. I didn’t understand why she looked so happy covering herself with that blanket, but whatever, as long as she’s happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll wake you up in thirty minutes. I’m gonna work–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, wait a second.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to get up from the couch to finish my work, but Asanagi grabbed the hem of my shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn’t she supposed to be sleepy? Why is her grip so strong?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let go of me and sleep…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stay here with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And why should I do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just stay here”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave up and sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I was the one who made her come here today, so I guess I should take responsibility and spoil her a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe… Thank you, Maehara… You’re so sweet today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it all of the sudden? I’m not giving you a single yen even if you flatter me like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t need your money, being with you like this… is enough for me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t understand what you are talking about, but sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hold my hand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three thousand yen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a ripoff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just used your card against you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jerk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our conversation went like this, but in the end, I still held her hands tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know why I’m doing this. Loneliness? Maybe I just want someone’s warmth? I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this even something that normal friends do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I questioned it, but when I saw her face, I stopped thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A warm feeling enveloped my chest. I wondered what it was?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the intercom rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Maehara, you got a guest?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah. I don’t know who it is… Maybe the delivery lady forgot something? I’ll check it out, wait a second.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let go of her hand, walked toward the intercom, and pressed the button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Living in an apartment like this, sometimes someone got the wrong address or a suspicious person just rang the intercom randomly. That was why if the one who rang it was a random person, it would be okay for me to ignore them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good evening, Maki-kun! Sorry to bother you this late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw her through the camera, my mind went blank for a second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she come here? Her timing couldn’t be worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Maki-kun… Umi is also here, right?”</span></p>
