<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Be My Friend</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing our apologies to Asanagi, we finally moved on to talk about last week’s incident. Before that though, we grubbed out on the tea and cookies that I had prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, these cookies are yummy ~ Umi, look, this one’s got chocolates on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Yeah, they taste good. Oh, try to eat them with these lightly salted potato chips. You’ll get that perfect mix between sweet and salty when you eat them together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? …Mmm, no, too many calories…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them were feeding each other sweets in a friendly manner as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was rare to see two people that got along </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> well, even among best friends and childhood friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? Ah, sorry. We unintentionally left you out… Okay, Maehara-kun, have  some cookies ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Yeah, thanks…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached out to accept the cookie Amami-san offered, but she pulled back before I could take it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, not like that, Maehara-kun. Say ahh ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to feed you. C’mon, open wide ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was confused for a second there, but I guess only one kind of ‘ahh’ was applicable in this kind of situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the matter, Maehara-kun? Don’t be shy ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhh… T-then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a sharp gaze coming from a certain someone, but it didn’t seem like she was going to say anything. Besides, if I were to refuse this, Amami-san would sulk again. I couldn’t let that happen, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it? Yummy, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, well, I was the one who picked them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The combination of both the aroma of the butter and the slight bitterness of the chocolate perfectly accented the sweetness of the cookie. If I were to score it, a chef kiss wouldn’t be an exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Jeez, I’ve told you over and over again, Yuu. You need to stop doing this or else the boys will misunderstand you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right. Sorry, Umi… It’s just, Maehara-kun looks so cute when he is eating these cookies! He looks like a little bunny ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bu—”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s the first time someone ever said such a thing to my face. I hated opening my mouth wide, especially when I was eating. I also ate a lot slower than most people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I imagined myself as a rabbit, but I immediately erased the creepy image from my mind. Seriously, that kind of abomination should not exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, I think I understand why Amami-san is so popular with the boys in our class. She is always able to treat everyone equally kindly, regardless of gender or popularity. She treats everyone as if they are her best friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If such a cute girl tried to feed a boy like that, obviously they would misunderstand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is like a temptress in a sense, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, stop eating for a second and move on to the main topic. You know, the reason why we&#8217;re even here in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right… Maehara-kun, sorry about last week. You were hanging out with your friend, right? I thoughtlessly tried to disturb you, I couldn’t read the room, sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…  Mmm. Me too, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head and started to explain to Amami-san the reason why I acted so hostile last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her honestly how I felt at that time. That I would be too self-conscious to enjoy myself in a group with more than three people. That I really cherished the time I had with my friend and how I didn’t want anyone to disturb it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san didn’t say anything. She just listened intently to what I had to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I really enjoyed the time I spent with my friend. After all, it was rare for me to play around with a student my age like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I kept some details to myself. If I told her everything, she would realize that my friend was Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see. You love your friend that much, don’t you, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-love…?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What’s wrong, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-nothing… Well, I guess you could look at it that way… But, that person is just a friend… I don’t know if I ‘love’ them or not…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was the only ‘friend’ I had. Of course, she was important to me, but saying that I love her right in front of her like this would be a no-no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This talk is so embarrassing, I can’t even look in Asanagi’s direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder what kind of face she was making right now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, please forgive me for last week. Also, I’m not angry anymore, so let’s forget about this and move on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you say so, Maehara-kun… Then, handshake?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her stretched hand and shook it firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good for you, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm ~ Thank you, Umi. Thanks to you, I’m able to make up with Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was worried about what was going to happen from here on, but at least last week’s matter was settled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the next few days, there would be rumors going on about Amami-san and I, but if we ignored them, they would eventually go away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most popular girl in class and a loner. We lived in different worlds to begin with, and now we could proceed to live in our separate worlds without having anything to do with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, now that we’re done talking, let’s go home quickly. We don’t want to be a bother to Maehara-kun, right? Huh, Yuu, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, mmm… There’s something I want to ask, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As they were about to go home, Amami-san suddenly turned back and approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what Amami-san wanted to ask…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Maehara-kun, if you don’t like it, you can be honest with me and say so, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… You see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san continued as her body slightly tensed up…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara-kun, if you don’t mind… I want to be your friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Goodbye, my peaceful life.</span></p>
