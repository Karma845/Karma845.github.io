<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Second Cutest Girl in My Class</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes, I wonder what exactly makes a friend, a ‘friend’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could two people who were in the same class and talked with each other often be called friends? Or maybe, two people who went to the school cafeteria together and had lunch together often?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, right? Wouldn’t that make them classmates? Acquaintances at most. I was still a student, so I might just be reaching by saying this, but I don’t think those cases would be different from talking or having lunch with your colleagues at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With colleagues, while you might call them ‘acquaintances’, you would never call them ‘friends’ nor ‘buddies’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Personally, I think you need to have a more personal relationship with someone before you could call them a ‘friend’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like hanging out somewhere after school or planning to meet up during our days off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only after crossing that line could an ‘acquaintance’ become a ‘friend’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that thought in mind, the number of people that I, Maehara Maki, could call a ‘friend’ or ‘buddy’ was close to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, considering I was that kind of guy who would think about those things from the wee hours… From back when I was still in grade school until now, when I’ve already entered high school, every day I would go straight back home after school and would spend my days off playing video games at home unless I had something else to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, this rule also applied to my seatmate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, good morning, Ooyama-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did have a classmate who would talk to me like this. My seatmate, Ooyama-kun, we often made small talk like this because our hobbies matched. But, he had a friend from his middle school whom he had been hanging out with for lunch, so we never hung out during that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well actually, he had asked me to do exactly that once or twice before this, but as you could see, I wasn’t the most sociable guy, so I just made the atmosphere awkward for everyone. Since then, I’ve mostly eaten my lunch alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve been classmates for a while now, but we still called each other with our surnames and ‘-kun’ attached to it, that should give you a rough picture of our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… I’m tired… I hope Saturday comes soon. You’re with me right, Maehara-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You act like this all week long… Well, it isn’t like I disagree with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that, but it wasn’t like I would do anything special on the weekends. On weekdays, I would go to school, immediately go back home after it was over, then, I would play games or read manga until I fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On weekends, just erase the whole ‘go to school’ part and that was how my days went. That was why I’ve never looked forward to weekends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, that was how I used to think…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, good morning ~ ! Everyone is tired of Monday because the weekend just ended, but still, let’s do our best together this week too ~ !”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As everyone languidly walked into the classroom one after another, a single cheerful voice echoed throughout the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Good morning, Amami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, Amami.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amamin, morning ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she walked into the classroom, the previously quiet atmosphere inside the classroom changed and became more cheerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm! Everyone, good morning! Ehehe ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the girl who blew away the quiet atmosphere of the class with her smile was Amami Yuu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her grandmother was a foreigner, so she was a quarter-blood, though her foreign blood seemed thicker. While her face looked Japanese, her blond hair and blue eyes made her look like she came out straight from an anime or manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As usual, our </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">number one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Ooyama-kun said, Amami-san was called ‘the cutest girl in class’ by the boys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, in her case, she could easily be the number one or two in the whole school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both her appearance and personality were almost perfect— That was why a lot of people flocked to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, it’s still early in the morning, while it’s good that you’re energetic at this hour, you need to turn down your volume a little bit, I could hear you from the hallway, you know? You don’t want to be a nuisance to the other class, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Umi! It’s a beautiful morning today, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, yeah, good morning. But that’s the third time you greeted me like that this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, isn’t it fine? You’re my best friend after all~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even best friends only need to greet each other once in the morning!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo, Umi is so cold!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of girls surrounding Amami-san, among them, a girl with a cool look caught my eyes. She was the one who had been having a friendly conversation with Amami-san for a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name was Asanagi Umi, also known as ‘the class’ second cutest girl’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, homeroom is about to begin! Everyone, take your seats quickly! Amami-san, that isn’t your seat!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell rang as our homeroom teacher entered the classroom. This was the signal for the whole class to return to their seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uee~ Umi~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, I’ll spoil you more later, okay? For now, just hang in there, Yuu-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What am I, a dog?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Asanagi-san teased Amami-san like that, everyone burst into laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the usual morning scene that unfolded every day in our class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I’ll take your attendance… Number one, Asanagi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Number two, Amami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was still on the way to her seat as she cheerfully raised her hand when her name got called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the eyes of almost everyone in the class were focused on Amami-san, she was like the class’ mascot at this point, there were two pairs of eyes that were focusing on something else.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Good morning.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…Mm.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the whole class was focused on Amami-san, Asanagi-san turned her gaze toward me, who was seated a bit further away from her seat and secretly waved her hand to greet me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Did Asanagi-san just look over here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s probably just your imagination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While deceiving Ooyama-kun, I secretly pulled out my phone from my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Asanagi-san): Hey, Maehara, can I come over after school this Friday? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to say something about our relationship, whether we were ‘mere classmates’ or ‘friends’ based on the standard I stated earlier…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi Umi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was ‘the class’ second prettiest girl’ and also the first person I could consider a ‘friend.’</span></p>
