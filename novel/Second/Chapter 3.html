<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; A Chance Meeting (2)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m familiar with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Name: Asanagi Umi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Previous Middle School: Tachibana All-Girl Junior High School</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hobbies: Outdoor activities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likes: Coffee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the information I received back when she introduced herself. Other than that… I knew that Amami-san and her were childhood friends. That was what Amami-san said when she introduced herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a boyish hairstyle and slender legs. Amami-san’s conspicuousness overshadowed her, but she was also quite popular among some of the boys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was known as ‘the class’ second cutest girl’ which was kinda rude of a nickname, but that was what the boys in the class called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… well, please, come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right… pardon me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I couldn’t just kick her out since she was still my classmate, so I decided to invite her into the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-san, or rather, a girl from my class, actually entered my room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve never really talked before, so how did we end up in this situation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, what the hell is going on here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll leave the pizza and the Coke here for now, is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pizza Asanagi-san bought was L-sized, the largest one available, while the one I just ordered was M-sized with some side dishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was only one L-sized pizza, the two of us should be able to finish it, but this… Well, it&#8217;s too late to cancel the order now, guess I’ll try to eat them, lest it be a waste of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, your room looked surprisingly clean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, my mother is a clean freak… By the way, where would you like to eat? At the dining table, or in front of the TV?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about Maehara-kun? Where do you usually eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just sit on the floor and place the pizza in front of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s pretty bad mannered ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m aware.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother was quite strict. On any day except on Fridays, I had to eat her cooking, so I pretty much had to properly follow the table manners. On Friday nights though, she would leave 2000 Yen for me to buy dinner for myself. Whatever is left over would become my allowance, so essentially, I could just spend that money however I liked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m fine with doing the same thing as Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t sitting on the sofa be better? You wouldn’t hurt your back that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you, an old man? …Well, if it starts to hurt, I’ll move to the sofa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we decided to place the pizza, the Coke, and the cups on the carpet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, sit on this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way I could just let her sit on the carpet, so I gave her a cushion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They called her the second cutest girl or whatever, but, honestly, I think Asanagi-san was quite cute, nay, beautiful would be a more apt description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I don’t understand why she came to my house?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah… so you really play games, huh? What kind of game is this one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That one is an FPS… but… ‘really’? Did you actually remember my introduction, Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. I mean, compared to the other kids, Maehara-kun’s introduction kinda stood out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a bad way, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I remembered everyone’s relieved face after the atmosphere I previously set up died down. They worked their hardest in trying to gather the others’ attention by acting cheerful or something like that. Then, 60 minutes passed in a more gentle atmosphere as everyone had their share of fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, except for me, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, thanks to that, I found a kindred spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A kindred spirit. Someone who shared the same ideals, goals, principles, and views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be, you like this kind of thing too, Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something like that… Well, I don’t know much about games, but on days like this, I love to slack off and do nothing ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Color me surprised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought someone like Asanagi-san would prefer to hang out in crowded places… but, I guess I just assumed things huh? Still, even though it was a surprising fact, it was rude of me to generalize things like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, what about Amami-san? Don’t you two hang out together? She’s your best friend… right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are best friends, of course we hang out occasionally. But, compared to me, Yuu is… well… popular, you know? Everyone wants to hang out with her, so she can’t just hang out with me all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that Amami-san would be hanging out with her classmate from her middle school… Could they also be Asanagi-san’s classmates?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s not like her friends are my friends too, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She heavily implied that she was not on good terms with that classmate of hers. Well, I guess that kind of thing happens. I’ve never really had friends, so I have not experienced those kinds of relationship problems before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, that’s why I decided to slack off for today… Then I suddenly remembered Maehara-kun’s introduction, so I followed you out of curiosity and found out that your house was surprisingly close to mine… Ah, right, sorry for tailing you like that, that was rude of me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s okay…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I couldn’t just slack off like usual since Asanagi-san was here, it felt good to have a conversation partner once in a while, after all, I did feel lonely sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, being able to speak frankly with Asanagi-san like this felt really nice, even though we never had a proper chat before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably because we were at my home that I could talk like this. After all, if this was at school, I would be too tense. Also, Asanagi-san carried this easygoing atmosphere that made her easy to talk to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Asanagi-san, the pizza you brought… what toppings does it have?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh? You’re asking that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my question, Asanagi-san grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ura Angel and demon’s garlic with cheese and teriyaki. Double cheese and mayonnaise, triple garlic! Half-price!] (T/N: Domino ad if you are wondering. If you don’t know Domino, it’s a pizza chain.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That sounds pretty good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. She is indeed a ‘kindred spirit’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, Asanagi-san and I poured a large amount of tabasco on the garlic pizza, and we ate it with gusto while chugging the Coke. Of course, I ate up all my orders as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the beginning of our weekend relationship.</span></p>
