<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Daytime Confession</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noon. Lunchtime finally arrived. My classmates, tired from morning classes, showed their relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of them immediately went to the cafeteria with their friends while the others gathered around their desks to eat their lunch together. To each their own, but for loners like me, sometimes, lunchtime could be a pain, today especially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, Maehara-kun, you didn’t bring a lunch today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, my mom only gave me this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed Ooyama-kun my shiny 500 yen coin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, my mother would wake up early to make a lunch box for me, but, if she got too tired because of her work, she would just give me money like this instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ooyama-kun, wanna go eat together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Well, my friends are waiting for me, so I gotta go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… Have fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that this would happen, there’s no way that he would eat together with me. After seeing him off, I also moved away from my desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi ~ Let’s have lunch together ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’ll join ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san and Nitta-san gathered at Asanagi-san’s desk. During lunchtime, those three would usually gather around like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry, I have to go out to buy something first, start without me, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Asanagi-san. This was rare, she didn’t usually try to break off from her group like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? But Umi, you brought your lunch, right? Do you still need to buy more food?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I’m not going to buy more food… Well, guess I’ll buy something to drink…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh sorry, but can you let me go by myself today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another unusual occurrence. Asanagi-san usually would bring Amami-san with her everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you are wondering, no, we don’t have any plans to eat lunch together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fine, but come back as soon as you can! Or else, I’ll eat your lunch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, a grudge over food is something reaaally scary, you know? …Well, actually, you can eat some of it if you want to… Well, I’m off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waving toward everyone, Asanagi-san hurriedly walked outside the classroom and bumped into me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-san just sent me a look before she passed me by and left the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed that she was staring at her phone the whole time, her face looked slightly unhappy. Well, that didn’t have anything to do with me, I shouldn’t pry about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though when our eyes met just now, it seemed like she had something to tell me.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, I’d better get going too.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to push Asanagi-san’s matter to the back of my mind and went to the store next to the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The store, which was located inside the cafeteria, was crowded with students looking to buy lunch tickets and bread. They neatly lined up in front of the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, since I came here later, popular food like stuffed buns had been sold out. All that was left were lighter foods like sweet buns or just plain bread. I went to the cafeteria and there was no seat available left for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, all I could get was a small </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anpan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and milk even though I didn’t particularly like them and wandered around to look for somewhere to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now… Where could I find a quiet place for today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether I brought my own lunch box or bought something for lunch, I would always look for a quiet place to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I could just go back to class, but I felt like the others were secretly ridiculing me whenever I ate alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this were a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">gyudon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ramen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> shop, no one would give a crap about me eating alone, but it was the classroom, it just felt wrong if I were to sit there and eat by my lonesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You might say that I’m overthinking things, but the fact that I’m always overthinking these things is the reason why I’m a loner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The courtyard… is crowded today… Well, let’s go over there then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A loner always prepared several places where he could be alone. Like the bench in the courtyard… right below the tree shade, the rooftop which was normally off-limits, the teacher’s parking lot, and the bicycle parking lot</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a nice day and I was in the mood to eat outside, so I went to the bicycle parking lot. There were a lot of shady spots, so I figured I could spend some time there without standing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;ease… go… with me…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard the voice of a boy that I didn’t recognize coming from some distance away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t make out what he was saying, but he was probably confessing. Well, this scene happens once or twice a month in places like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, youth…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t care less whether he got accepted or not, but getting too close to them wouldn’t be a good idea. I snuck around and blended into the shadow of the bikes, opened my bag of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anpan,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and proceeded to listen to the rest of the confession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Um… Sorry. I’m not interested in dating anyone right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said the girl, her voice sounded familiar to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that the one who got confessed to was Asanagi-san.</span></p>
