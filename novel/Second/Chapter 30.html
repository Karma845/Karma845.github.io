<h3>Chapter 30 &#8211; Breakfast with Asanagi</h3>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Earth to Maehara ~ You still sleeping?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The couch was unexpectedly uncomfortable. It took me an hour before I managed to finally fall asleep. The next thing I knew, a sweet voice managed to rouse my consciousness back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up feeling extremely groggy, probably because I only got a light sleep last night. I would love to go back to sleep, but I felt like I&#8217;d get cramps if I were to sleep any longer, so I chose to get up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… Morning, Asanagi… What time is it now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Maehara, it’s not seven yet, I think.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like Asanagi woke up earlier than me. She had already changed back into her uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She dressed like an honor student. Her uniform was fully buttoned up, and her skirt was of the appropriate length. It’s too bad her personality didn’t match her appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you sleep well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, thanks to you… You didn’t seem to be enjoying your sleep though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I learned the hard way that even though the couch is great for napping, it doesn’t come close to a real bed when it comes to sleeping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha. Well, if you’re still sleepy, just go back to your bed. I just woke up, so my scent, warmth, and everything should still be there for you to enjoy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Has anyone ever told you that you’re a creep?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…If anything, it would be harder for me to sleep in that kind of situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, where’s my mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was still sleeping when I walked past her room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, let her be then… Anyway, have you eaten? If you haven’t, I’ll make something for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? It’s fine, I don’t want to bother you any more than this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m making breakfast for my mom anyway, so making an extra portion isn’t really a bother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you insist…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Asanagi sat down, I went to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want bread or rice?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rice, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the fridge and took out the ingredients that I needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I help? I can’t help you cook, but I can help with the side dishes and cleaning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, leave the cooking to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We proceeded to make our breakfasts, I did the cooking and Asanagi did the rest. Since we were using leftover rice, the only things I had to cook were fried eggs and grilled salmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, I’m done here– Wait, are you going to make miso too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, yeah, I prepared the stock yesterday, so I only need to add the tofu and the dried seaweed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stock was sloppily made, I just threw some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">iriko</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> into the pot and let it boil for a few hours. It’s simple, but I got a good amount of it, so who cares. (T/N: I don’t know, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">iriko</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> means a lot of different ingredients, including and not limited to rice flour and dried sardine, the author wrote this one in katakana so I don’t know which one he referred to.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the miso soup was simmering, I cooked an egg on the other stove and grilled the salmon. Everything should be done in around ten minutes if I multitask like so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;And done. How much rice do you want, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally I eat a lot in the morning, but I’ll hold back, so just give me a bowl, chef. If I’m still hungry, I can just ask for more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you implying that I’m gonna give you a refill? This isn’t a family restaurant, you know? Well, I made a lot of rice, so just eat as much as you’d like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I set the table and dug right in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Woah, the omelet tastes better than your egg rolls from the other day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well the egg rolls were cold. Nothing beats a freshly cooked egg. Glad you enjoyed it though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Seconds, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You finished it that quickly?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, not that I mind. She must have liked the food to have inhaled it that quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to have another serving too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was used to eating alone, but now that I was eating with someone else, I found it quite enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… Thanks for the food! Sorry, Maehara, I ended up eating a lot.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s alright. I should be the one apologizing, I only made you simple dishes like these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, don’t apologize. They were delicious, so thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, we ate half of the rice that I previously cooked. Sure, we are high school students and still in our growth period, but I think we might have eaten a little too much for breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I think it’s about time for me to go home… I’ll help you clean up first though. Also, I’ll call you later, but can you deliver my gratitude to your mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, but… Didn’t my mom give her phone number to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. She said, ‘if Maki bullies you, I’ll beat him up for you.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why though?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, she would be the one who bullies me… But, I wonder what kind of talk they had last night?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m curious, but I can’t just ask her about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, do you want some coffee? It wouldn’t be enough to thank you for your cooking, but I’ll do my best for you. You like your coffee with sugar, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, leave it to me– Ah wait, that’s my phone, maybe it’s my mom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched Asanagi’s back as she left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wore an apron over her uniform. I’d never imagined that I would see her dressed like this outside of Home Economics class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I never would’ve expected that this girl would slowly become an indispensable part of my life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really cherish what we have, not because she’s my first friend, but just because she is who she is. I guess the best way to put it would be that I cherish this friend named Asanagi Umi. I haven’t understood the nature of that weird feeling from last night, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m back…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back… You took your time, did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Uh… I tried my best to stop this, but it didn’t work…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi returned with a complicated expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got a bad feeling about this…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… what happened?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… That’s… Uhh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi glanced at my face, looking apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mom told me to bring you to my home… right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, God.</span></p>
