<h3>Chapter 45 &#8211; Wait A Little Bit Longer</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, this might be the first time we’ve ever been this close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Skinship wasn’t a new thing for either of us. I mean, she patted my head a few times and we’ve even held hands before, but this was on another level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel the warmth of her body, also certain parts of her body through her uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart rate quickened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot… Idiot! Why are you being nice to me? I know it’s one of your good points, but why are you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> nice to someone like me? If you keep acting like this, I’ll definitely take advantage of your kindness, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Asanagi…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No… Don’t turn around, please. I don’t want you to look at me when I’m like this… If you dare turn your head around, I’ll give you a head flick…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew she wasn’t crying, but I could hear her sniffles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood her feelings because I wouldn’t want anyone to see me in that state either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry for today… Also, thank you for the textbook…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, yeah, make sure to appreciate me properly. You have no idea what I went through for your dumb textbook.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost burned that textbook out of rage, but I managed to restrain myself. Then again, I didn’t want to become a criminal just yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara… were you angry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha… Of course you were, huh? I mean, you didn’t do anything, yet I made you go through all that because of my selfishness…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tightened her embrace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel her heartbeat through my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why did you do that in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to tell ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, isn’t this the part where you should start telling me everything like in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">mangas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">? Why are you breaking that cliche now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just think of me as a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tsundere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suuure you are</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for being a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tsundere ~”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, seriously…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to tell her that she was really cute right now, but I stopped myself. Seriously, why did this cute girl even try to associate with a loner like me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I were to tell you everything, would you listen to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I mean, that’s part of the reason why we’re here, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Even if it’s gonna be a long story?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everything started back when I was in middle school… maybe even earlier…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that something might have happened to her back when she was in middle school. After all, she came from a prestigious all-girls middle school. There should be a reason why she decided to come to co-ed school like this instead of just continuing her studies there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if she was willing to tell me about her problems, I would be more than glad to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was well aware that her problem this time would be something really heavy, and since her best friend, Amami-san was clueless about it, it probably had something to do with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A piece of Asanagi Umi, that even Amami-san doesn’t know about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the problem might just be something trivial, since Asanagi was the type of person to fret over the smallest things, but even if that was the case, I would be glad to listen to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I were friends. I may not be as close to her as Amami-san, but she trusted me enough to confide in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I had to respond properly toward that trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I’m really soft on her, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… since you agreed to listen to me, can you wait until the festival?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, but do I really have to wait that long?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I could talk about it right now if you want me to, but I just think it will be easier for you to understand if you give me some time to gather my thoughts…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if that was her decision, what else could I say?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I’ll wait.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I promise I’ll tell you everything later…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let’s get back to work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, we went back to our work. It took longer than expected because of her suddenly hugging me, but it should be fine. We could make excuses like; we were cleaning the cans, or there were more cans than we expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? ‘Sup? C’mon, we gotta go quickly, we wasted enough time already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to Asanagi, who was counting the cans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you counting the cans from my bag? Go back to yours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who cares~ Whether I’m counting from yours or from mine, our work efficiency won&#8217;t change. If anything… Umm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi stopped embracing me, but she didn’t increase the distance between us. Instead, she worked right beside me, our shoulders were even touching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that nonsense about efficiency or whatnot, it was clear that doing it this way would be more inefficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I knew that even if I told her off, this dumbass wouldn’t listen to me. What a brat. Seriously, such a pain in the butt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, whatever, let’s do this together if you so insist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Took you long enough to say that. Seriously, you’re such a pain in the butt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look in the mirror.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did, I found a cute girl there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sheesh, just shut your mouth and work, idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What did you just call me, idiot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just shut up, idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And before I realized it, we started our usual childish banter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We still had a lot of things to take care of, especially the thing with Amami-san. For now though, we could put the little drama between us to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything will be fine from now on, yep. This Asanagi, who got a buff from this amazing me, should be able to confront Amami-san whenever she wanted to.</span></p>
