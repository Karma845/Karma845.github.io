<h3>Chapter 58 &#8211; In Exchange of that ‘Agreement’</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Weekends were supposed to feel relaxing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Weekends were the days when you could get your well-earned rest after a gruesome work or school week. It was the time we always looked forward to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Sure, there were weekends when you would brood over trouble at work or something, but this… I wasted the whole weekend brooding over this…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I love you…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words that Umi whispered to me when we parted last time. A lot of things happened during that day. This and that led to that moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, jeez, Umi… What’s with that timing?… Because of that I can’t spend my weekend in peace…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words convinced me that our feelings were mutual. After all, the timing, the atmosphere, the gesture she made, she didn’t seem to be teasing me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was a confession, right? …I’m not deluding myself, right? …She did say ‘I love you’ to me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mulled over it again and again, trying to convince myself that it was indeed a confession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was ninety-nine percent sure that it was a genuine confession. That meant if I were to accept it, from now on we wouldn’t just be friends anymore, but something more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s really the case… Yeah, of course I’m happy. The girl that I love told me to my face that she actually loves me, f*ck yes, I’m happy about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But how should I reply?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m happy, but what should I do now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me that she loved me, but I hadn’t given her a response. It’s Monday now, and we haven’t called or texted each other since that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It’s embarrassing, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it shouldn’t be that hard to reply. Type ‘I love you too’, send it, and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can’t do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Maki. I have a meeting today, so I’ll be leaving first… Huh, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Nothing, really…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure? You’ve been like this for a few days now. I’ve been refraining from asking you, but… Did something happen with Umi-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So mom had been watching me. I’ve spent my weekend brooding over Umi’s confession. I didn’t notice it at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm~ Well, if you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. Anyway, if you’re gonna bring her home on Friday like usual, make sure to tell me. I’ll give you extra money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, mom. Have a good day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing her off, I started my morning routine. I didn’t get much sleep because of the confession thing, so I looked like a mess right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark circles under my eyes seemed more pronounced than usual. I don’t want Umi to worry about me over this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve had rough Monday mornings like this before, but today was special. I didn’t lose sleep because I stayed up gaming, but because of a confession from a girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still couldn’t believe that it happened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Still, a girl falling in love with someone like me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my reflection on the reflective surface of the kettle. I looked really gloomy and my eyes looked like that of a dead fish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi might be the only one who would love someone like me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I must not let her go. Umi might not realize it, but she is better than Amami Yuu in every way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only one who knew that was me, but it wouldn’t take long for others to realize as well. And chances are, that someone would be better than I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would easily lose to that person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I currently hold the advantage, so I must strike while the iron is still hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That cute smile of hers, I don’t want it to be directed toward someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mhm. I’ve decided.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind after brooding over it a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m going to tell her how I feel today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sooner I do this, the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sipped my coffee, the doorbell rang, announcing the arrival of a visitor, a rare occurrence in our household.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Ehehe, good morning, Maki-kun!}</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{&#8230;G-good morning, Maki.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the screen, I saw the same faces I saw last Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san with her angelic smile and Umi with her awkward expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let them enter the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry for barging in so suddenly, Maki-kun!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, I’ve done my morning preparations… Anyway, what’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Well, I heard everything from Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that might be the case. So Umi decided to tell Amami-san everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, if my eyes aren&#8217;t deceiving me, I saw dark circles under Umi’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Was she also brooding over her confession over the weekend?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, why are we both like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s that, but why are you two here so early in the morning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, well I want you two to do something for me. You know, in exchange for our ‘agreement’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like, right now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! I’ll tell you the details later though~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here it comes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, fine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I accepted Amami-san’s words without thinking any further, but Umi gave me an uneasy look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure you’re gonna accept this? Yuu hasn’t told you anything about what she’s going to ask you though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. I mean, I’m kinda scared, but you gotta do what you gotta do, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, this is Amami-san, she wouldn’t go out of her way to harm me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, her request might be a little bit troublesome, but that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… Also, Umi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san is in front of us right now, but who cares. If I don’t do it now, I might be too embarrassed to do it later. I should do it while I can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m going to tell you now… I feel the same way as you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… M-mhm… got it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face turned red as she quickly turned her face away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She muttered ‘idiot’ when she did, but it sounded like music to my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe… Well, that’s what he said, Umi. What are you gonna do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Uhm… F-fine. If Maki said he’s gonna do it, then I’m gonna do it too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, it’s decided!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve made up my mind already so I’m currently ready for anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san’s evil-looking smile worried me a little though.</span></p>
