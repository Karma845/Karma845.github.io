<h3>Chapter 38 &#8211; It Was Supposed to be Us Two</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to use a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shounen manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> MC as our model for the mosaic art. With him as our model, we started discussing our sketch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First things first, what kind of picture should we make, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously the picture where he could shine the most. Him with his chainsaws, surrounded by the blood and guts of his enemies!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we’ll need a lot of black and red cans for this. Hmm, we can use the coke cans. They shouldn’t be too hard to gather since we drank a lot of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided not to paint the can manually if possible, unless we failed to gather enough cans to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, everything depended on the size of the art itself. If we wanted to make a decently-sized one, we might need a hundred or so cans. That was why we should decide on what color we needed quickly so we could start gathering the cans right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, we move on to something more specific. What kind of pose would be good? Should we rip it off from the official art?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ripping it off, huh? That’s a grey area we’ll be traversing, but wouldn’t it be fine since this is technically fanart? …Well, just in case, we should ask someone more knowledgeable about this… Like your mom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…‘I’m busy, so don’t bother me. Also, since it’s only a school project, they wouldn’t be petty enough to copyright claim you. So if you want to do it, then do it.’ is what she said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That sounds like your mom, alright. Well, we should send them an email, just in case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could technically make an original art instead, but neither of us was talented enough to come up with one. I asked her if she knew anyone in the class who could draw, but she said that there was none.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could use free-to-use images of him, but since we were aiming for the grand prize, we were afraid that such images wouldn’t be impactful enough to win us the prize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s look for a good image first, after that we could start doing the sketches.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your problems have reached my ears, so here I am, ready to help!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““Huh?””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly a girl’s voice rang out from outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl was hiding behind the classroom door, probably trying to conceal her identity, but her voice was a dead giveaway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Amami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe… As expected, my hunch was right. You two get along really well, hm– Ow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amami-san rushed over to us, Asanagi welcomed her with a head flick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be with Nina, collecting the empty cans?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… That was the plan, but then I thought of the two of you… I wondered if I could help you a little since your workload is heavier than the rest of us. So, I asked Ninacchi and the others if I could help you guys instead and they agreed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she was right. We had been running around since early this morning preparing for the exhibit and attending the committee meetings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for your concern, Amami-san, but we don’t really need that much help currently. We only need to turn a picture into a sketch for the mosaic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What he said. Well, we’ll still accept the sentiment. But anyway, just leave everything to us and go back to your group already, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu… Maki-kun ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Trying to appeal with your gaze like that won’t work on me, Amami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all honesty, I don’t mind her helping out, but if I were to spoil her, Asanagi will hit me again, so I chose self-preservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine fine, jeez, you both are so… Ah, wait, is the theme of the mosaic based on this manga?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> seems strange, but the characters look cool.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san picked up the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, then flipped through the pages without showing any hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shounen manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, a battle-focused one at that. Seeing Amami-san reading this kind of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I can’t say that it fits her image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you mind if I draw the picture for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Amami-san after she had gone through all the pages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san, you know how to draw? Why didn’t you tell me, Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I didn’t know…Yuu never told me anything about this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can. I used to draw a lot before I befriended Umi… After reading through this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I feel like I could draw it… Maki-kun, can I borrow a pen and paper?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Sure, go ahead…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave her a pen and paper. After receiving them, Amami-san began to draw without even glancing at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhh… The boy wielding his chainsaw… His enemy is a girl… Blood splattering everywhere… And the boy is making a pose in the center of the sea of blood…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She mumbled that as she moved her hands to draw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Umi, give me ten minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was absorbed in her drawing as she made an unusually serious expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, she made a similar expression back when she was playing the game at my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay, it’s done! What do you think? I added my own touch for the art, is it good?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I were both flabbergasted when we saw the picture she handed to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We couldn’t even nitpick anything about it. Yeah, it was different from the original, but she captured the atmosphere, character, and the tiniest details almost perfectly. The quality was high, it seemed like something a pro would come up with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, she did this on the fly with whatever was available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san, are you actually a pro?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah ~ if I was, there’s no way that Umi wouldn’t find out about it. I mean, I can’t hide anything from her ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san smiled at me. Seriously though, she said it’s been a while since she last drew, yet she could produce a high-quality drawing like this…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi-san, we can use this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah… Mhm, right! We can use this alright! Thank you, Yuu! Also, shouldn’t we color the picture first?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, using this for our project will be a little more complicated, but since it’s mosaic art we’re talking about, it shouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys will use this? Great! I’m glad I can be useful to both of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Useful’ was an understatement, she might as well be the carry of this project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her looks were angelic, and she was talented in all sorts of things to boot. And they said God doesn&#8217;t give with two hands…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, we’ll assign Amami-san to handle the sketch, so it will be the three of us working on this. Asanagi-san and I will calculate the number of cans we’ll need, so Amami-san, you can concentrate on your drawing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay! Then, Umi, Maki-kun, I’ll be in your care!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the sketch would be the biggest hurdle of the project, but it turned out to be smoother than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t wait to go home and start working. Umi, you’ll help me with the coloring, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll help you by nitpicking everything you draw, yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You meanie! But, you know, this is my first festival in high school, so I’ll make sure to give it my all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, good for you. What about your studies?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm… Hehe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You little brat!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow! Maki-kun, help me! Umi is bullying me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you start clinging to him like that! Anyway, I’m beat, so I’ll be going home. Good work, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for your effort, Maki-kun, bye-bye ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of them left while joking with each other like usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our cultural festival preparation was moving along smoothly thanks to Amami-san’s unexpected interference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something was bugging me though, so I sent a text to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Asanagi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: What? Need something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Not really.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: It’s just I noticed you seemed a little down.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Ah… well, I was just shocked.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Even I don’t know everything about my best friend, that made me think about something.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Don’t mind it, Maehara.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I’m fine.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: You sure?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Yeah.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Are you really sure?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Yes, I’m sure, stop asking the same thing over and over!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Well, if you say so…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that’s what she says, what else could I do?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, why are you making such a bitter face?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself, thinking about Asanagi’s expression when she left together with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she jealous of Amami-san? No way that’s the case, right?</span></p>
