<h3>Chapter 31 &#8211; You Aren’t Lame</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi’s family summoned me. I didn’t know why they would call me this early in the morning, but I’d bet it has something to do with causing them so much trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After cleaning up, I steeled myself and left the house with Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was all so sudden, I didn’t have the time to prepare myself properly. I tried to dress up properly, but I only have cheap clothes that are function over form, so everything I tried on looked really lame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve been meaning to tell you this for a while, but… Your fashion sense is bad. I know that you don’t care all that much since you don’t leave your house often, but why does everything you choose look lame on you? Seriously, your fashion sense is something else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you said, I don’t care much about it. Besides, it isn’t all bad. You liked the sweatshirt from last night, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That one’s an exception. The rest of your clothes are either black or gray, what’s with that? Are you trying to appeal to the Lord of Darkness or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll have you know that I graduated from my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Chuuni</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> phase last year. Besides, I have white clothes too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sure, but still… Agh, the next time you go shopping for clothes, make sure to send me pictures first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you can tell me not to buy them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, your fashion sense is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> bad. You probably bought those from a pawn shop or something anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s cheap…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if she were to leave me on my own, I would probably leave the house dressed in all-black, so I decided to leave everything to her instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, seriously, humans are such inefficient creatures. They have to go through all this trouble just to go outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, by the way, what about your mom? Should I leave a note for her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I already did, ‘I’ve been summoned by Asanagi’s mom, don’t look for me’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you, a runaway child? Also, mom isn’t mad at you, don’t treat this as your death sentence or something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, her dad was an SDF member and he had been busy with work, so he rarely came home. (T/N: If you don’t know, SDF is Self-Defense Force. Japan’s equivalent of the army, kinda, since they can’t have one.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…In other words, I evaded certain death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have a daughter myself, so I wouldn’t know how a parent would feel, but if my daughter came to my house early in the morning with a boy, I would definitely kill him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, we walked side by side through the residential area while exchanging jokes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wearing my casual clothes while Asanagi was wearing her uniform. It felt strange to walk with her like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my gaze to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that she just woke up and only lightly dressed herself up, but she still looked beautiful. Her skin looked smooth and the morning sun enhanced her beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was pretty to begin with, but since this was Asanagi we were talking about, she definitely put in a lot of effort to take care of herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, even though she acted sloppily around me, she acted properly everywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ‘Asanagi Umi’ that everyone knew was the hard-working girl that put her all into everything she did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What’s up, Maehara? Still nervous?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’ve calmed down…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why are you staring at me like that? You fell for me or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Well, I do like you… As a friend though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A-ah… okay, thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, nothing… Anyway, what’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not nothing obviously, but if I were to push for an answer, she’ll hit me, so I’ll back off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s not a big deal… But, when we’re walking side by side like this, don’t you think it feels unbalanced, somehow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know if it’s because of the sunlight, but Asanagi looked especially radiant today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance on the outside is already amazing, and while I’d never say it to her face, she was beautiful on the inside as well. It’s no wonder she became the center of the class along with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then there is me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting my status as a loner aside, I know that the current me looks really gloomy with the out-of-the-place clothes I’m wearing. There’s also the fact that I keep my gaze on the asphalt all the time, adding more to my already gloomy atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I knew that Asanagi wouldn’t mind. She is that big-hearted. That’s why I got along well with her in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You’re still worrying over what the rest of the class had been saying?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Well, to be fair, this is the first time I’ve had this much attention. It&#8217;s natural to be worried, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not worrying about it would be easier said than done. After all, they left their negative feelings bare for me to feel, so it was hard to ignore them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know who started this, but lately, baseless, unpleasant rumors about me spread to the other classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trigger of this was the fact that I got along better with Amami-san recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I’d just dismiss those rumors as the wailing of the losers who couldn’t even bring themselves to talk to a girl, but still, sometimes those thoughts would creep into my mind and make me feel miserable. This just happened last night when I was having trouble sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I’m such a mess…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I vented everything to Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… The conversation turned heavy this early in the morning because of me, huh?&#8230; Sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine… Also, dropping this kind of topic out of nowhere should be a no-no in any kind of circumstances though, not just early in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, I’m so inconsiderate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… Maehara, turn around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah? What are you on about–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ei!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I turned my head around, I felt a slight touch on my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a gentle head flick from Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you doing?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing ~ It’s just you looked kinda cool for a second there, so I need to bring the uncool Maehara back to restore balance to this world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you kidding me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is she on about? Cool? When I’m venting my inferiority complex like this? Is she okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Asanagi’s face looked serious as she continued her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I was exaggerating when I called you ‘cool’, but hey, what you were doing wasn’t lame or anything like that, you know? Admitting your insecurities like that… Not everyone could do it even if their lives depended on it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that so…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I mean, look at the people who mocked you. They did that because they couldn’t admit their insecurities. That’s why they grouped up with other similar-minded people and talked sh*t behind other people’s backs. I’ve been with Yuu for a while, and their behavior is familiar to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even within the center of the class, which seemed peaceful on the outside, there should still be some kind of conflict hidden behind the scene. Asanagi’s position as Amami-san’s best friend might have sparked other people’s jealousy, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, you might think of yourself as a lame person or something, but I don’t think so. You aren’t lame, not at all. Of course, I’m talking about your personality, not your looks, that’s a whole different story.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi placed her hand on my head and gently stroked it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No ~ thing. Your head is just in the right place for a head pat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How does that make any sense?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I didn’t mind her petting my head like this, so I decided to let her do whatever she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you think that you being with me is ‘unbalanced’ or whatever, I’ll help you fix that. After all, the only ‘unbalanced’ thing about our relationship is our look. Fixing your appearance to be more presentable is nothing for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then, if I ask you to turn me into an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ikemen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, you’ll be able to do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I know a good place. Let’s see… eyelids, chin, nose, and body modification… Yeah, give me two million right now and I’ll fix everything for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So in the end, it’s all about money, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you on about, of course it’s all about money. You know those pesky people who badmouthed you behind your back? Yeah, slap them with a thick wad of cash and they’ll shut their stinky holes up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi oi, you sound like a massive jerk right now, stop it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muahahaha! I’ll take that as a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, our conversation spiraled back to our usual silly banter, but thanks to that, I felt a lot better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another thing became clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t matter what others said, Asanagi was my friend, and they won’t be able to change that fact.</span></p>
