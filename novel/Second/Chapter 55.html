<h3>Chapter 55 &#8211; By Ourselves</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I’d have to spend the day by myself, but I guess that won’t be the case anymore. I told them to enter the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I notified my mom about them coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied, ‘Good luck’. I didn’t know what she meant by that and I refused to ask her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Welcome… Well, come on in…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… S-sorry to bother you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was the only one who entered the house. Amami-san quickly left after she dropped her off here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, it’s cold! Maehara, why aren’t you turning the heater on? Are you secretly a masochist?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you on about? The heater’s broken, we’re getting it repaired. It won’t be fixed until tomorrow, so just bear with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wouldn’t it be hard for you? The weather report said that it would get even colder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’ll manage. I just need to put on more clothes. I’m a very patient person, you know? This much is nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Said the one who called me out of loneliness the other day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bringing that up was unfair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, forget about the temperature for now. What do you want for dinner?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shrimp, crab and cream seafood set. Oh also, clam chowder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She ordered a lot of food. I wasn’t sure why mom gave me an extra thousand yen this morning, but I guess I had to thank her. But, did she predict that this would happen? No way, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I called another restaurant to order her food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Drink? Coffee like usual?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… But I want more milk and sugar in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would make it a lot sweeter than usual, are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I’m in the mood for something sweet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Guess everyone gets into that kind of mood once in a while”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly prepared two cups for us. From my perspective, they seemed more like cafe au lait than coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you… Woah, it’s sweet. Too sweet…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what you wanted, I just followed your order.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. I imagined it would be this sweet. You’re amazing. Compliments to the barista.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sat down on the couch and drank our coffee- no, our cafe au lait, together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made it myself, but this drink was way too sweet. It wasn’t bad to drink this once in a while, but if I were to have this every day, my caloric intake would probably be through the roof. This thing was like Coke, you should only enjoy it once a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, let me hear your story.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There’s nothing much to talk about… We were about to go to the arcade, but Yuu said she wanted to go somewhere else…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so she forced you to go with her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;S-something like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it? I’m not lying, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you weren’t lying, why were you looking so flustered? Well, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being able to talk to her like this made me happy. I’m not going to sweat over small things like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, whatever. Wanna play a round?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. I mean, even though I didn’t want to come, I’m already here. Might as well, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the thrown away controller and sat down to play with her as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Just so you know, I haven’t been slacking off. I’ll raise my win rate by ten percent today!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it cold? Here, take this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrapped the blanket I’ve been using over her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing her scarf, but she was still wearing her school uniform, in other words, short skirt and thigh high socks. I could see her shivering a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you… but, aren’t you cold?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m wearing a lot of clothes, so I’m fine. See? I’m wearing two pairs of socks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, that’s lame…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kidding. Then, I won’t hold myself back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She accepted the blanket and wrapped herself up in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance was so cute, I immediately laughed at her after seeing her like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what is it? You’re the one who told me to wear this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, sorry, sorry. You look so great right now. Can I take a picture?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, I got carried away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite all that, she didn’t tear the blanket away. After that, we decided to start playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course it was the usual PvP mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Maehara, aren’t you getting better? I’ve been training in secret, and thought I had a chance…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’ve been playing against the world rankers until just now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This might sound unconvincing coming from the guy who rage quit after getting into a lose streak, but I felt that I played way better than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, playing a game felt better when you enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I enjoyed beating her in the game while losing a few times against her for the sake of it. And seeing her expression throughout the game, I realized…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Playing with her was so fun. Even though it was so cold, I failed to notice it because I was having such a great time with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… Stop, stop! What the hell is this? Why do I keep losing? I’ll never play this game ever again, damn it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. We’ll continue next week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… Next time I’ll make you cry… Prepare yourself…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when both of us realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There wouldn’t be a next week. Rather, her being here today was a miracle in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-Maehara… Sorry… T-that was…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right… Me too, sorry… It completely slipped my mind…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Amami-san’s meddling, we almost forgot about our original goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to not hang out for a while and we should&#8217;ve stuck with that decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this moment, the intercom rang again. Apparently it was the delivery guy. Perfect timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mhm. Sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a while since we last ate at the same dinner table. As usual, we quickly devoured our food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we both ate, we kept stealing glances at each other for some reason and occasionally, our gazes met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our gazes would meet, then we immediately turned away, then we tried to look at each other again before turning away again. We tried to talk about pointless things like usual, but our conversations would end abruptly everytime and in the end, we ate in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though there was a lot that I wanted to talk about with her, why couldn’t I say anything?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Now that we’re full, why don’t we watch a movie?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were still a few hours before Asanagi had to return home, but how could we spend our time together after this?</span></p>
