<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Sorry</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maehara Maki and Amami Yuu. The two people who were completely unrelated to each other were having a conversation. This fact made the previously lively atmosphere turn silent in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Uhh… Me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She specifically mentioned my name, so of course she was calling me out, but I was freaking out, I couldn’t help but blurted that question out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I gathered the curious gazes of the whole class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I doubt anyone would’ve expected the cutest girl in the grade to call out to the most disliked person in the class. The other classmates probably found this to be a scandalous development and were loving it. I, on the other hand, hated that this may start some stupid rumors that would continue to fuel their conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. It won’t take long, I just want to talk to you about… last Friday… Do you… Mind?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t mind… but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the other classmates started whispering to each other, I glanced at Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what Asanagi and Amami-san talked about, but maybe she told Amami-san to at least apologize to me quickly since our last meeting was pretty much an unpleasant one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi gestured an apology with her hands… I guess this meant that even Asanagi didn’t see this coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry I made you mad last time. I didn’t know anything about you, Maehara-kun, I thought it would be fun if we were to hang out together, but I was too insensitive to notice your feelings…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, it’s fine, Amami-san, you don’t need to apologize. I should be the one to apologize. I was the one who was insensitive, so please, raise your head.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even need to question her sincerity. Her face looked so gloomy, it was obvious that she was serious about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a forced apology she was giving me. It was a serious, heartfelt one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it would be fine if she were to ignore someone like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew this already, but Amami-san was really kind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, will you forgive me? You aren’t angry at me anymore?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. I’m not angry anymore. I have to apologize for what I did too, so, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, I should be the one who’s apologizing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as we both bowed our heads at the same time, the bell rang, announcing the time for the homeroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gotta say, the bell had good timing. If it didn’t ring at that moment, we would be stuck in the endless apology loop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright ~ everyone, take your seat… Huh, it’s so quiet, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yagisawa-sensei, our homeroom teacher, came into the classroom and sent us a gaze filled with suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… Let’s just say that we’re even.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, I’m fine with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Maehara-kun. But, I want to talk with you a little more… Do you have time today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Yeah, I do, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weekends were no go, but today was Monday, I didn’t make any plans for Monday, or any other days, for that matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s settled then! I’ll let you know the details later… I gave you my phone number the other day, you saved it, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment those words slipped out of Amami-san’s mouth, the class filled with whispers.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oi, did you hear that?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How did he get Amami-san’s phone number?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This isn’t the first time they talked?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oi oi, I’m so jealous…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They didn’t even try to hide it, their conversations reached my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Eh? Did I say something wrong…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amami-san… That was supposed to be a secret, no…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time we talked was not at the arcade, but a while back, under the shadows of the bicycles in the parking lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when we hid and watched Asanagi’s confession together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve already apologized to Asanagi about it, but I kept the fact that Amami-san was with me a secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is why it isn’t the class’ murmuring that I’m afraid of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… Uhh… See you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment Amami-san walked back to her seat with her small steps, the phone in my pocket vibrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t even have to look to know who messaged me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the same person who took her textbook out and stared intently at the blackboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[We need to talk.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw her message, I let out a small yelp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will a simple apology be enough for her to forgive me? Should I resolve myself and do a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">dogeza</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">? (T/N: If you don’t know, dogeza is the prostrate apology.)</span></p>
