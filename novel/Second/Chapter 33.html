<h3>Chapter 33 &#8211; Amami-san, Once Again</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sleepover incident was resolved peacefully with both our mothers apologizing to each other. There was also a subtle change in our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Umi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know it’s the second time you greeted me this morning, right? Well, whatever, good morning, Yuu. Anyway, what’s up? You look so happy this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh ~? Umi, did you forget ~? Today is the day for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san snuck in a wink at me. Today was Wednesday. Right… I promised Amami-san that I’d make her some sweets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was the week right after the incident, I’d honestly rather not do it this week and move the date to the next week instead, but I couldn’t bring myself to disappoint Amami-san like that, so I decided to keep my word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I already told my mom about this beforehand. Ever since the little incident with Asanagi, she made me promise to tell her whenever I brought a girl home. In other words, I needed to tell her whenever Asanagi came over to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered my mom’s expression when I told her about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She comically fell out of her chair.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘U-Umi-chan wasn’t enough for you, so you snatched her best friend as well?&#8230; Ahh… My recluse son had turned into a harem manga protagonist before I knew it!&#8230;’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is calling your son a harem </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">protagonist even appropriate? Anyway, I explained to her that both Amami-san and Asanagi were just my friends, but my mom insisted on making me introduce Amami-san to her. I had a hard time refusing her demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, on the bright side, she paid for the ingredients we were going to use today and the quality was quite good too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? What is it, what is it? Yuu-chin, are you gonna play with Umiumi again? Can I tag along ~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ninacchi, sorry! We planned to hang out at Umi’s place today, we can’t invite you, sorry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sorry about that, Nina. Yuu will make up for it later, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm… Well, okay then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nitta-san reluctantly agreed to it. Today, both Asanagi and Amami-san planned to go to my home separately, so even if they were tailed by her, it should be easy for them to shake her off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: The thing with Nitta-san, will it be okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: She’s probably gonna tail us, but don’t worry about it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Got it. Then, see you after school.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Got it. I’m looking forward to your homemade sweets.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: It’s nothing special though…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: What? Are you humble-bragging to both me and Yuu now? You know we’re hopeless at housework so you’re trying to rub it on our faces, is that it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Cry about it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: F*** you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I tried to sneak a look at Asanagi because normally she would secretly wave her hand at me or do something under everyone’s noses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been acting strange since the beginning of this week. She kept turning her gaze away from me whenever we made eye contact in class and sometimes when I ran into her outside the classroom, she would just ignore me completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn’t trying to avoid me or anything since we were still texting each other like usual, but the fact that she had been acting like this for days now bothered me a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I’ll get a chance to be alone with her today, I guess I’ll ask her later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school was over, I went home and prepared everything for Asanagi and Amami-san’s visit. Not long after I had finished preparing, both of them arrived and entered my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe ~ I’ll be in your care today, Maki-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mhm… Likewise, Amami-san… You too, Asanagi-san, I’ll be in your care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, likewise… Um… Sorry for being the third wheel today&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was the first time Asanagi came to hang out with me outside of the weekend. Maybe it was due to Amami-san’s presence, but our conversation felt slightly awkward today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would probably have been fine if we were to talk more casually with each other, but whenever I tried to speak with her, my thoughts would wander into last week’s incident and throw my mind into disarray, leaving me with this awkward feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, Umi, Maki-kun, stop being this stiff! Especially you, Umi! Since you are both friends, you should try to talk more casually like you always do!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh… But I’m more like the friend of a friend to Maehara-kun though…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That shouldn’t stop you two from getting along! Okay, fine. Both of you, shake hands!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““&#8230;””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like this was the first time we shook hands. Hell, we held hands a few times previously, and Asanagi even patted my head on more than one occasion. So why am I feeling so tense?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi and I looked at each others’ hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, good… Now get along, you two!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhh… The Princess has spoken so, yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-right…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lightly squeezed Asanagi’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand felt soft and smooth like always. Sora-san seemed to care about her appearance a lot, so Asanagi probably learned to maintain her body from her. That was why her skin felt so smooth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand, however, was rough because I had to work with detergents every day. The differences between our skin’s texture surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhm… I’m gonna go and prepare some more stuff, so you two should sit down and watch TV or something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like to help, but… I think I would only be a bother to you… Umi’s the same as me, so it can’t be helped, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, we should just stay out of Maehara-kun’s way for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left both of them and went to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As planned, I was going to make banana souffle pancakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t a complicated dish to make. First, separate the yolks of the eggs from the whites, then beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Next, mix the yolks with mashed bananas. And finally, fry them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there were some tricky details involved when making it, such as when to stop when mixing the bananas with the meringue, but you’ll get used to it as you practice more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, now we wait… Huh, what are you two up to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was preparing the coffee while waiting for the pancake when I noticed that the two girls were messing around with something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry, we’re borrowing your game– Wait, Umi, that’s not fair!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All is fair in love and war! On the battlefield, if you let your guard down, you’ll be killed! Understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, both of them were playing the game that Asanagi and I usually played.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, that Asanagi… hold back a little, Amami-san is a beginner, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I can reprimand her for it since I did the exact same thing to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Umi, why are you so good at this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, lately, I’ve been playing this game in my brother’s room, that’s why… Anyway, it’s my win, so my portion will be bigger! Let’s go, eat everything before it gets cold!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu… Umi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha! Don’t worry, young grasshopper, first we eat, then I’ll teach you everything I know after we are done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then, I’ll be in your care, Master!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Master huh… Well, likewise, my disciple!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never expected that Amami-san would be interested in video games. She looked really excited when playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess I’ll need to report to mom that they would be staying here for a while longer.</span></p>
