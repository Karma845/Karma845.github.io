<h3>Chapter 57 &#8211; See You Next Week</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah~ Teasing Maki was fun~ I didn’t realize that the time passed so quickly~ Huh? Maki, what’s wrong? Why do you look so tired?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gee, I wonder why…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that mess started, Umi continued pestering me using the fact that we were sharing the blanket together. Whenever I tried to get out of the blanket, she would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> remind me that it was freezing cold. In the end, I couldn’t escape from her teasing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Though, now that I thought about it, I could’ve just borrowed mom’s blanket, couldn&#8217;t I? Why did I even agree to share a blanket with this girl?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I even said dumb things like how her smile looked better than Amami-san… Just kill me already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel my face getting hotter as I remembered all the dumb things I said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah~ Seriously, what are we even doing? We’ve made up our minds to not hang out for a while, but look at what we are doing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously… We’re hopeless…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this was why Amami-san brought Umi here forcefully. Well, she did say that she didn’t want us to stop hanging out. I guess I could understand why she did it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, we really couldn’t underestimate her, huh? Her timing was amazing. Was it a coincidence? Or was it calculated? Or maybe both? Who knows…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Maki, I got carried away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, I’m used to your antics… Besides, I was feeling lonely anyway, this much rowdiness feels like bliss to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding our promise with Amami-san, we decided to discuss it with her again later. We were thinking about calling the whole deal off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today made me realize that our time together was important for both of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course we would try to make it up to Amami-san in other ways. I was thinking of letting Amami-san decide on what that would be… And yeah, I was prepared for whatever she’ll have in store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re all set, let’s get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Kay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of us left the house together. I made an excuse about wanting to go to the convenience store to walk her home, but I really just wanted to spend a little more time with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment we stepped outside, the cold air hit our faces hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it was only November, the temperature felt as cold as the middle of the winter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Brr it’s so cold! I need to start wearing tights…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? Here, I got a hand warmer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you– …Maki, you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, never mind. No matter what I tell you, you’ll insist that everything is about functionality&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She started complaining after seeing my clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wearing a puffy black jacket and dark jeans. Also, I wore another pair of pants underneath it to protect myself better from the cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, even though there’s barely any people around, you’re still walking with a girl, so put more effort into dressing yourself. Also your presence is thin enough already, if you’re wearing this kind of clothing in the middle of the night like this, a car might hit you if you’re unlucky.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She even brought up functionality in her argument, it was hard to argue against her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be that bad, right? …I mean, whenever I go shopping for clothes, only plain colors like navy blue, black or gray suit me. Everything else didn’t fit me, they only made me look weird.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, your face is a lost cause so screw that, but you should change your hairstyle. Cut those bangs away and then try out the clothes again, you’ll notice a difference. Maybe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for having such an ugly face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least your face is gentler than you used to look. It shouldn’t be hard for you to change your atmosphere, don’t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what she said. I guess I’ll try to believe her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Then, tell me more about it next week, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, next week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next week. At the usual time, in the usual place, just the two of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making that promise, we slowly walked down the road to the Asanagi’s Residence in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Umi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were walking along the edge of the empty street. At one point, we started holding each others’ hands for no particular reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the temperature got colder, I pulled her hand and stuffed it inside my coat pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, our bodies were closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… How frustrating, this lame jacket is really warm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See? It’s warm and I could stuff a hand warmer in. The functionality is great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Well, I’ll give you that for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Anyway, doing this kind of thing in public feels embarrassing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Tell me about it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone from our class saw us, things would get really messy. But even if they did, I wouldn’t invalidate our relationship anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no intention to hide from them anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to act casually with her at school too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, save from calling her by her first name, it still feels embarrassing to do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is far enough, I’ll go alone from here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we reached the railway, she slowly put her hand out of my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure? I don’t mind taking you all the way to your house, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do that, my mom will catch you. She’d been nagging me to bring you home and if she were to see you now, she’ll force you to stay over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay, I understand…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see Sora-san doing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, even if she personally gave the okay for me to stay over and stuff, there were still other Asanagis in the house. Umi’s father, Daichi, and brother, Riku, were all there and I’ve never met them before. It would be awkward if I were to intrude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’d better get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. See you at school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waved at her lightly as I watched her walking away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her footsteps were light. Right now, she wasn’t the honor student Asanagi Umi, but a normal high school girl you could find anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m sorry, Maki! I forgot something!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to leave, she came running back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What did she forget? I made sure that she didn’t leave anything back at home before I locked the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up? If you left something at my house, I can deliver it tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry, it’s not that. Give me your ear for a second.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Sure??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the sound of the train crossing the railway echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Umi whispered something in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, bye bye for real this time~ Take your time, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My cheeks reddened as she immediately ran away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vibrations and the sound of the train passing by shook my body, but I couldn’t move from where I was standing, even after Umi was out of sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take my time my ass… That’s just unfair…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I noticed her feelings a while back, but I still got nervous when I actually heard it from her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you for always prioritizing me… I love you…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight…</span></p>
