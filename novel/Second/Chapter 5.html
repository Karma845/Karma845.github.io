<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Girl Named Asanagi Umi</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After welcoming Asanagi-san who arrived a little late, we sat down to watch the movie she rented while eating the dinner we each had brought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she had said, Asanagi-san rented a shark movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The title was ‘Tremble in Fear! The Angel Shark!’ (original title: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Angel Shark</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">)&#8230; The cover showed a man-eating shark with angel wings swooping down from the sky to attack the people below it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What the hell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the title alone, it screamed B-movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you like to watch this kind of thing, Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, not really. I love mysteries and thrillers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why did you rent this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, apparently, this movie was a new release, so the rental fee should be higher than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I mean, sometimes, it’s better for us to laugh our ass off at shitty movies like these rather than watching a serious one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside of school, Asanagi-san had a very different vibe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At school, she was a fairly serious student with excellent grades and athletic ability. She also tends to be the straight man within Amami-san’s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that same Asanagi-san, right now…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[SHAAAAA!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[GYAAAAH!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! Are you kidding me? A flying shark chomping people under the evening sun, that’s gold!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Was sitting on the floor, stuffing her face with fries while watching the movie played with its silliness laid bare. She looked like a totally different person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong, Maehara? Is the plot moving too quickly for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. Stories aside, they sure put a lot of effort into making this movie…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right? The effort they put into making something this dumb is insane.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi-san who would wear a cool smile in class, and the Asanagi-san who was cackling loudly while clapping her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m likely the only boy lucky enough to see both sides of her. But, something was gnawing at the back of my mind…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, it isn’t like I mind hanging out with Yuu and the other classmates, I actually like them, that’s why I hang out with them so often in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What’s with this sudden change of topic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? I mean, Maehara, your face looks like you are confused about something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure if I should ask her about it or not, but she actually read my expression like a book, as expected of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, your personality here and at school are really different, so I was curious…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had to play that role, you see? Everyone unanimously follows Yuu, so someone has to rein them in, or else things will get messy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flow of the conversations in class would be, Amami-san starting things with a joke while smiling cheerfully, the rest of the classmates joining her, then when things got a little bit rowdy, Asanagi-san would butt in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without Asanagi-san acting as the straight man, the conversation would spiral out of control, gradually lose its momentum, and then be replaced by an awkward silence. I knew this from my experience observing the so-called ‘top-caste’ students from the corner of the class for quite a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind that kind of atmosphere. For me, rather than being seen as a gloomy person, I want people to see me as a cheerful person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… You’re pushing yourself, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After nodding, Asanagi-san sipped on her cup of Coke. Her eyes were focusing on the screen during the entire thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like I said, chatting and hanging out with Yuu and the others is fun. But, while I always try my hardest to keep up with everyone, I do feel overwhelmed at times… Following the flow of the conversation… Guiding it so the atmosphere won’t become unpleasant… There were times where I would suddenly get back to my senses and went ‘what the hell am I doing with my life?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Asanagi-san seemed relaxed most of the time, she sure had a lot on her mind, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was probably why she was looking for a place she could turn to whenever she was feeling overwhelmed. A place where she could decompress without worrying about keeping up appearances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that your introduction might have been a sensitive topic, but it was Maehara’s honesty that gave me the courage to reach out and become friends. I may be tired of being with the crowd at times, but I’m also not used to being alone…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand that… Though it’s the opposite for me. I’m used to being alone, but that doesn’t mean I love being a lone wolf.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My situation was the opposite of Asanagi-san’s, but there were times when that feeling of loneliness struck me randomly while playing a game or reading manga. At that time, my mood would worsen and I’d feel depressed, thinking ‘what the hell am I doing with my life?’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I guess we are alike in one way. Though I figured that out earlier, after all, we did eat junk food together like this, while laughing at a dumb shark movie on the top of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve only hung out together like this a few times, but I felt like I got to know her a little better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she was a cool person who would take care of everyone, but once she threw that role away, she became a normal, cheerful girl who liked to mess around and acted a little bit sloppy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt just a bit closer to her now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Asanagi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next time, I’m picking the movie.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you get an alligator movie next?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let’s not watch another animal-themed one, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weekend passed by as me and Asanagi-san planned our next meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the shark movie was decent, and actually quite funny.</span></p>
