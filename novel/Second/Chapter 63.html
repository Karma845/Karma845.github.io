<h3>Chapter 63 &#8211; Kisses Are Only for Lovers</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure whether we were friends or lovers, or whether our relationship took a step forward or backward, but ever since that day, our time together had increased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, we actually tried to increase it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just woken up when I heard the doorbell ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, this is Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Good morning, Aunt Masaki. Is Maki awake?}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My, good morning, Umi-chan. Maki just woke up. Seriously, that child has a terrible sleeping habit.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Got it. Then I’ll try to give him some ‘encouragement’.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you on about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard my voice, Umi’s expression brightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she’s here to wake me up, that means she must have woken up even earlier. I’m amazed that she could be so fired up this early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{Good morning, Maki. I’m here to pick you up.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Good morning. Come on in, quickly.. Have you eaten breakfast yet?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">{I’ve eaten already. But I won’t refuse if you give me some rice, eggs and miso soup.}</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eating two meals early in the morning, is your stomach a black hole?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We started going to school together whenever we had the chance. Though we weren’t alone because we would meet up with Amami-san along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Also, she has been getting more clingy lately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me… Woah, your bed hair looks terrible. Come here, I’ll fix it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, I’ll fix it myself later. Just sprinkling it with water should do the trick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said, I’ll fix it for you. Just come here and stop complaining.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she proceeded to fix my bed hair with wax and a comb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why are you looking at us like that, mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm~? Nothing~ I just thought that I don’t have to worry about your future anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She proceeded to stare at us for five whole minutes. Before I realized it, Umi finished her job already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, that’s it. What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… It isn’t half bad…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She handed me a hand mirror. My terrible bed hair had changed into a neat looking one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was against the school rules to put too much wax on, so we couldn’t exactly style our hair up, but this was so much better than how I usually dealt with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could hide the dark circles below my eyes, I would look more presentable, probably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, say the magic word?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, you’re welcome. You look cool, Maki.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you flatter me, I won’t give you anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just telling the truth. You look </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">slightly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> better than usual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course she took the chance to tease me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, oh my!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, my mom was being rowdy on her own. She started taking pictures with a digital camera for some reason. Seriously, what is she doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been a while since Umi started visiting us in the morning, but during that time she had become a part of the Maehara family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that means I have to start visiting her family to make it even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Umi, Sora-san had been telling her husband about me, so I had to introduce myself soon whether I liked it or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it seemed like our mothers were bonding even quicker than we were. Apparently, ever since the sleeping over incident, they kept in touch with each other frequently and became considerably close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I made my mom leave the room to make space for both me and Umi to have breakfast together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The food tasted the same, but I wonder why I felt more energetic while eating?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, maybe I should try to exercise once in a while. Umi had been nagging me about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, all done. It’s a little early, but we should get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Yuu told me she just left her house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We cleaned up the dishes and left the house together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We didn’t hold hands out in the open because it was embarrassing. We didn’t have much trouble doing it inside the house, but we were still embarrassed about displaying our affection publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ah right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, the thing that I told you previously? The thing about your cute smile or something…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… The thing about how I got the cutest smile in the world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you on about? Are you high?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, she could interpret it that way if she wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu… Let me have it okay? I mean, I’ve been acting like an honor student for a long time now… Let me be selfish for once…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi decided to reveal her true self to Amami-san little by little, but in front of the rest of the class she still wore her honor student mask. The whole lover’s hold incident changed everyone’s perspective of her though. Personally, I thought she should use this as an opportunity to show everyone her true self more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… I could stop, but I don’t want to even if it’s tiring. Besides, Yuu has been starting to pay more attention to me, so it isn’t all bad… Also…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going to say it only once… So, listen properly…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… Only want to show my real smile to you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She grabbed my sleeve as she muttered that embarrassing line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-I see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t the one who said it, but my face felt extremely hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s good that we’re the only ones here in this elevator. I wondered what would happen if someone were to suddenly enter at this time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s such a sweetheart and she’s really cute, but I wish she would think about the timing a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sorry… I-I shouldn’t have said that with that timing… I just embarrassed myself… Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Let’s just pretend that it never happened, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-Right… sorry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I got off the elevator, the cool winter breeze cooled my burning cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was another cold day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe after a short walk, the heat in my cheek would cool down even more and the pounding in my chest would eventually stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Maki, wait. You dropped something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Was it the key to my hou–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment when I turned around, I felt a soft sensation against my cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Umi??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe… You let your guard down…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved away while holding her index finger to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll do it on the lips after we properly become lovers, okay? …Then, I’m going to meet up with Yuu first…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… O-Okay… Got it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ehehe… See you later…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi, whose face was red up to her ears, giggled and ran away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Seriously, she is so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Never mind, I was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My burning cheeks and the pounding of my chest didn’t subside at all.</span></p>
