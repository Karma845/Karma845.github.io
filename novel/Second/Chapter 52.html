<h3>Chapter 52 &#8211; What to Do?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I had guessed, Asanagi was on the roof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, the rooftop was locked. But since Asanagi was part of the committee, they entrusted her with the key in case something happened.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yo.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called Asanagi, who was holding onto the fence while staring listlessly at the distance.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you up to? That expression doesn’t suit you, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, you idiot. I told you to leave me alone. Are your ears just decorations?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You told Amami-san, not me. Also, a little advice, next time you want to be alone up here, lock the door. Leaving it unlocked like this, it couldn’t be helped that I got the wrong idea and thought that you might need some comforting from me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I hate you. Dumbass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. Here’s a tissue, wipe your face, you’re a mess right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without saying another word, she snatched the tissue from me and blew her nose with it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the usual Asanagi, this one was like a crybaby. Actually, maybe this was her real self? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected, you’re amazing. I mean it. You’ve been bottling up those feelings deep inside your heart, and you still managed to stay sane.”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither I nor Amami-san were aware of this until now. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been feeling a sense of distrust toward her friends because they lied to her, feeling frustrated because the friends she cared about stopped talking to her. She had to keep her loneliness in check and on top of that, the reason why this happened was because of her best friend, Amami Yuu, who was better than her in every way.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had a slightly weaker mentality, she would probably have broken down at some point.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You did your best, Asanagi. I’m proud of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes… I did my very best. Praise me more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Good girl.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pat her head. Our position was pretty much reversed from last time.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… I said everything to her, didn’t I? Nonsense like I both love her and hate her… But why am I still feeling so shitty? I said all those horrible things to her to make me feel better but it didn’t even work. I’m the worst…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you hate yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I made her experience everything that I went through, you know? I lied to her, I kept our relationship a secret and kept hanging out with you behind her back… Seriously, why do you guys even bother trying to help someone like me? You guys are nuts.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, she didn’t lie once or twice, but multiple times during the course of a few months. You could say what she did to Amami-san was worse than what she previously experienced.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it was partially my fault that this happened. I told her to keep everything a secret from everyone in class, including Amami-san. I basically created a perfect situation for her.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was no use crying over spilt milk.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do from now on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean your relationship with Amami-san, are you going to make up, or are you going to distance yourself?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Words, once spoken, cannot be taken back.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why she had to decide on her future plans. Her future with Amami-san, and while we were at it, our future.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’ll ask you instead, what are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m the one who is asking… Ah, whatever, I’ll answer you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Go on…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it’s better for us to distance ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me and you, we should distance ourselves.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been thinking about this ever since Amami-san found out about our relationship.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Asanagi and I had a habit of overthinking things. Sure, we could proceed as usual and pretend that this whole mess didn’t happen, but we would be ridden with guilt every time we hung out with each other and because of that, I doubt that our time together would be as enjoyable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could add Amami-san to our group, but that wouldn’t help either. We would just be repeating what happened to Asanagi back when she was in middle school. If we were to proceed anyway, those two would surely be overly considerate toward each other and everything would turn awkward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, the best thing to do would be to reset our relationship. Pretend that me and Asanagi weren&#8217;t friends to begin with and make her focus on making up with Amami-san. After everything was done, we could always return to where we were before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s going to be fine. I’m not saying that we’ll stop being friends, we’re just gonna hang out less for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, Maehara…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re in the same class, so we can see each other every day. We can still exchange texts like usual. Also, we don’t need to hide behind everyone’s back anymore in school, we could just tell them that we knew each other through the committee–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi shook my shoulders. Thanks to that, I came to my senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, calm down. I’ll listen to you properly, okay? Just calm down for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said everything was for Asanagi, but in the end I only thought about myself, huh? Seriously, what the hell was I doing, forcing my opinion on her like that while disregarding her feelings?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lost sight of my original goal, what a joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, I got carried away…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m the one who should apologize. I was so busy thinking about myself, I didn’t even consider your feelings. You must be confused, huh? Dealing with this kind of unfamiliar situation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. This was the first time I’ve ever had a friend and the first time I’ve had to deal with a relationship problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was trying to solve this kind of problem even though I was a loner. Man, I got too cocky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, hold my hands. Take a deep breath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did as she told me and took a couple deep breaths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This also happened earlier this morning, except our positions were now reversed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it? Have you calmed down yet? Look at my fingers, can you count them?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three… I’m not drunk, you idiot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, you look better now. Do you want me to hold your hand a little longer, just to make sure that you’re alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sure…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, Asanagi had to comfort me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I acted like a total showoff in front of Amami-san, this happened. Seriously, what the heck am I doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me honestly. If I stop hanging out with you, will you miss me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to answer her honestly. I mean, even if I tried to lie, she will see through it anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Of course I will…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I tried to act tough, that wouldn’t change how I really felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had always thought that being alone suited me better. I thought that dealing with people was a major pain in the ass and nothing good would come of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was wrong. I just didn’t know how comfortable it felt to be with someone I cared about. I started to long for the warmth of another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, dealing with people was still a pain, but I enjoyed the time I’ve spent with this girl. With her by my side, I was able to laugh my troubles away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that our friendship wouldn’t be broken even when we were apart. While it was true, I would still feel lonely without her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our relationship… Do you want us to continue it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do… But at the same time, I want you and Amami-san to make up…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you’re so greedy. If you were to tell Yuu the same thing you just told me, she would be mad at you, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I know it sounds greedy. That’s why I told you we should distance ourselves for the time being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. I’ve been lying to Yuu for a long time now. If we don’t settle this matter quickly, we won&#8217;t be able to move on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wishing that Amami-san would forgive us for everything that we had done to her while continuing on with our relationship; there was no way that we could do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had to consider Amami-san’s feelings as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Regardless, I understand your feelings. Thank you for being honest with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re welcome… So, have you decided?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm… Well, I’m not really sure about it, but this should be the best course of action for all three of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to have made up her mind. Her gloomy face was replaced with one brimming with confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Then, let’s go back to Amami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hurried back to Amami-san, who had been waiting for us to return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went there, hand in hand until the last second. Amami-san didn’t even notice what we’ve been doing.</span></p>
