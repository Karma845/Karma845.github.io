<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; Side by Side</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since my mom forced me back to my room, I’ve been sitting on my bed, doing nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t expect that Asanagi would ever sleep in my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While a pair of friends hanging out all night wasn’t a strange occurrence, that only applied if both of them were of the same gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of different genders, even if they were lovers, people would still frown upon the thought of two high schoolers doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My door was shut, so I couldn’t see what my mom and Asanagi were up to. I also wore my headphones and listened to music, so I wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop on their conversation. I did keep track of the time though, so they probably finished bathing by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also wanted to take a bath, but mom told me not to. She said something about ‘Umi-chan’s bathwater’ or something, as if I cared about that. If she was concerned that I’ll get strange ideas from Asanagi’s bathwater, then why not just drain it? I don’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the song I was listening to was from a rock band I had been listening to lately. They went viral because they sang the opening theme for a certain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anime</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, but nowadays they were better known for singing the theme song of a popular TV Drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Stars in the sky, the cold night streets, shoulder to shoulder with you… The starry sky I saw back then had already gone…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hummed a certain song that was currently trending. Probably because it was the theme song of a popular TV Drama, the song stood out even though the genre of the song itself was quite a cliche. Or maybe the meaning of the song was just that good? Who knows? I’m not exactly an expert on love songs or anything…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, something like love was a bizarre topic for a loner like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I wonder… Who exactly is Asanagi to me?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was currently listening to music and reading my favorite </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">manga</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I couldn’t help but think about Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of us played games together often, shared meals together, and joked with each other… She was a peculiar person, doing those things with a loner like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I thought of her as a precious friend of mine, and if possible, I want us to be friends forever. I just hope that she felt the same way as me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even if I sometimes forget about it, there was a fact that I couldn’t ignore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a girl, a member of the opposite gender. Even if we often threw dirty jokes toward each other, this fact wouldn’t change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her grades were excellent, she was a model student, and she was so pretty that my classmate called her ‘the second cutest girl in class’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the image she had at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the same Asanagi was currently taking a bath in my house and was about to sleep in my room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When that thought crossed my mind, I felt like my heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why?&#8230; What the hell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I felt nothing when I took a look at her sleeping face a while ago.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Our white fingers, intertwined on this bed, this time I won’t let go of your hand.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh! Seriously, this song is messing with me, sheesh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly changed the song to an upbeat one, in hopes of erasing these weird thoughts from my mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I mean, it’s Asanagi that I’m thinking about. Yeah sure, she is pretty, but this is the same person who drools in her sleep with her mouth half-opened like an old man.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to convince myself like that, but when I remembered her face when she was sleeping, I felt like my heart skip again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Boo!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, a voice startled me to the point that I felt my heart would jump out of my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! I was just trying to surprise you a little. As expected, your reactions are priceless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-Asanagi… Can’t you knock before entering?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did, multiple times. It’s not my fault that you didn’t hear it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Asanagi with a dumbfounded expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, normally I would be able to hear her knocking, but I guess I was too focused on repelling my evil thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right, I’m borrowing your sweatshirt because your mom’s clothes didn’t fit me, sorry about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s fine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Actually, I love this one. It feels really comfortable. Maybe I should buy one too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was currently wearing a navy blue sweatshirt. It was large and comfortable to wear, and I wore it all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, I thought that her and mom’s stature were similar, because of their height… Well, I shouldn’t pry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was currently wearing an oversized sweatshirt so you couldn’t see them, but her chest was quite big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Whoops, bad mind, bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m gonna go to the living room, so good ni–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to leave the room, but Asanagi grabbed me by the back of my collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was asleep until a little while ago, so now I’m not sleepy. Accompany me for a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure? Mom told us to not be together for too long, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It won’t be long. Besides, if you ever try to assault me, I can just scream.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As if I would do that, dumbass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom is a woman of her word. If Asanagi ever did that, even as a joke, mom would definitely come and beat my ass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, here, sit next to me ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just so you know, that’s actually my bed…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s mine now, so shut up and come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi patted the side of the bed as she called me. What does she think I am? Her dog?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, I’m still a guy, why was she so defenseless? Well, I didn’t want her to jokingly shout, so I had no choice but to comply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m worried that mom would notice, but it seems like she is currently taking a bath, so it should be fine for us to talk for the next ten to fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never thought that I would be staying over at your place. Don’t you feel like a chad now? Having a cute girl like me staying over?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you weren’t so sloppy and fell asleep, none of this would’ve happened, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, true…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi let out a chuckle. I could smell a soft citrus scent coming from her. Even though she used the same shampoo as me, for some reason she smelled better than I ever did. Is it the perk of being pretty?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we delinquents now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If word got out that we actually did something like this, it would definitely damage Asanagi’s image at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe, even Amami-san would be disappointed in us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi… You know, I’ve been thinking about this for a while…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you going to tell Yuu about our relationship?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wha? What the hell, stop reading my mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I had the same thought when I was bathing. Honestly, I also think it’s about time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, we were thinking about the same thing. After all, no matter how hard we tried to hide it, Amami-san would definitely find out about it at some point. Not to mention Amami-san had a good relationship with Asanagi’s family, so even if we tried to keep our mouths shut, she would eventually learn about it from them instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be better for us to come clean so that things wouldn’t get complicated later. I was the one who suggested that we keep our relationship a secret, so Amami-san shouldn’t blame Asanagi as much if things were to go badly, but it was still better if we confessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t mind playing the villain here anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I’ll tell her when the timing is right, okay? For now, let’s just continue as usual.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve promised to hang out with Amami-san next Wednesday, I’m ready to face her anytime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if she ended up telling the whole class about this, I would be just reaping what I sow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, that’s that, so what else should we talk about? Ah right, the timing is just right. So, did you buy any con– ouch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s doing this on purpose, isn’t she? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously… Go to sleep. My mom will be out of the bathroom soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, you’re so mean. Well, whatever, I’ll let you go for today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi was still Asanagi after all. She could still throw in a dirty joke in a situation like this, jeez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She made me feel like an idiot for having any evil thoughts for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, one last thing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good night, Maehara… Hehe, saying that out loud actually feels embarrassing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah… Good night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly closed the door to my room, moved to the living room, jumped onto the couch, hid under the blanket, and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Dammit, she actually looked cute when she did that.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her embarrassed expression came to my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">So, she’s able to make a face like that too, huh?&#8230;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of her, I felt restless for the rest of the night until I eventually fell asleep.</span></p>
