<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; Amami-san, Asanagi, and I</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The event in the morning where Amami-san blurted out that I knew her phone number quickly became the main topic of the day in our class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After homeroom, during lunch and even now after school ended, curious glances, whispers, and slander that were hurled at me never stopped… Rather, I felt that as time passed, they got louder and louder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be clear, Amami-san and I never contacted each other over the phone before, save from the time when she made the one-ring call to confirm that I received her number back when we eavesdropped on Asanagi’s confession.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Psst, what kind of relationship do you think Amami-san and Maehara-kun have?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe they are dating?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hahaha, no way.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Then, what happened last week?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Who knows? A love affair?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, everyone didn’t know or care about such things. Because of that, they kept talking about it all day long, straying further and further from the truth while bringing up their own wet dreams about my relationship with Amami-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously, they need a better hobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kept you waiting, huh, Maehara-kun? Let’s go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… S-sure…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whole class was talking about it, so of course the other related party, Amami-san was aware of the situation. But she didn’t seem to care. Instead, she casually approached me with her usual cheerful smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she was used to this kind of situation, unlike me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, of course, Asanagi was by Amami-san’s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to interrupt your time together… But, is it okay for me to accompany Yuu here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… Uhh&#8230; Sure, I don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scratch that, I desperately need her to tag along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, sure we would be moving somewhere else to have our talk, but the thought of having a one-on-one conversation with Amami-san, the cutest girl in the class, made me nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, Maehara-kun… You see, I get nervous when I’m alone with a boy, that’s why Umi is tagging along… Ah, don’t worry, Umi is a tight-lipped girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh. I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I knew that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, she didn’t even tell her best friend about her secret friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s that. So I’ll be in your care, okay? Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah, likewise, Asanagi…san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We shook our hands as if it was our first time talking to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though her grip was unusually strong… No, wait, it hurts, please let me go, it hurts!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, ‘the cutest girl in class’, ‘the second cutest girl in class’ and the ‘loner’ left the school together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was such a surprising lineup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From left to right, Amami-san, me and Asanagi. I was sandwiched between two beautiful girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to run if I could though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. Hahaha, jeez, it’s the same old Ninacchi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Nitta-san?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah, she is tailing us from behind, isn’t her stalking skill amazing?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi muttered that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t notice it, but I guess the other two who were close to her easily read her moves, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, back when Asanagi received a confession, she was also doing the same thing… I really wish she would hold back from doing something like this.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Alright then, we’ll do our usual thing, Umi…’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah, yeah.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san and Asanagi whispered to each other, ignoring me who was walking right in between them. It seemed like they were planning to do something.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What are you going to do to Nitta-san?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eh? Nothing. We’re just going to run away, right, Umi?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If someone is following you, you should run, isn’t that obvious?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, I’m sure that’s just a ‘you’ thing…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since being stalked like this felt unpleasant, I decided to go along with their plan.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At the end of the road, we’ll dash and split into two groups. Maehara and I will go to the left, Yuu, you go to the right.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Got it. Ah, what about the rendezvous point? We can’t really just go to a store nearby, there are too few options here…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rendezvous point. Normally it would be at a cafe or karaoke, but there was a good chance that Nitta-san would be able to find us there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A place where it could afford three people to have their secret talk, away from their classmate’s gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…There was only one place that came to mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, what about my house then? It’s pretty close and no one knows where it is.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom wouldn’t be back until nightfall, we had all the time in the world to talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, since Asanagi came often, I took my time to tidy up the room a little bit. Of course, Amami-san didn’t know about this.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What do you think, Umi?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, Maehara-kun doesn’t seem like someone with bad intentions, so it should be fine.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it wouldn’t cost them anything and it sounded like a reasonable choice, I thought that it would be a good idea, but their reaction was outside my expectation.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eh? Did I say something strange?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah? N-no, you didn’t, it’s just…’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Our princess over here is wondering if it’s okay to  casually invite a girl into your house, Maehara-kun.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘J-jeez! Umi!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ahh…’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized it when Asanagi pointed it out. It was supposed to be the first proper conversation between the three of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Amami-san, we weren’t even friends yet and I suddenly invited them to my house. It was normal for her to be on guard against me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I invited Asanagi often, so it completely slipped out of my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Now, what to do…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘S-sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it… I just thought it would be easier for us to talk in my house, I had no ulterior motives!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uh, i-it’s okay! It’s okay! It’s not that I’m suspicious of you or anything, Maehara-kun! I was just startled!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that, but her face was red up to her ears. Since she was so popular, I thought she would be used to something like this, but she’s surprisingly innocent.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s settled then. Meet up at Maehara-kun’s house at 5 pm. I’ll go with him first, then I’ll send you the address later.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘R-roger!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Alright, let’s do this, three… two… one… go!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using Asanagi’s words as a signal, the three of us split up and dashed off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! They’re running away! Hey, wait for me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear Nitta-san’s voice from behind me, but since this was a residential area with narrow streets, it was difficult for anyone to chase us down since we could easily shake them off at a corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who would listen to a paparazzi? Over here, Maehara!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oi!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi grabbed my hand as if it was the most natural thing to do and we ran side-by-side all the way to my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah? You’re kidding right ~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if it was because I was running for my life or because I was just nervous, but Asanagi’s hand felt slightly damp.</span></p>
