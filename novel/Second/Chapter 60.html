<h3>Chapter 60 &#8211; From Now On (1)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since then, we never entered the class while doing the lover’s hold again. But our action at that time left quite the impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After acting as the representative for the committee during the cultural festival, my classmates gradually recognized my presence, but I was still pretty much a nobody. Compared to Umi, who was the center of the class along with Amami-san, I was nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why none of my classmates expected that I would barge into the class while acting lovey dovey with Umi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that though, everything was hectic. Both Umi and I had to deal with people inquiring about our relationship throughout the week. People kept asking me how I managed to win Umi over, who was notorious for rejecting other people’s confession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This and that happened and our relationship was finally exposed. People were surprised that our relationship was more intimate than they expected. Both Umi and I had to deal with the embarrassment for an entire week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, things weren’t all bad. We managed to fulfill our real goal, which was erasing the awkwardness between Amami-san and Umi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi~! Let’s go back home together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oof! …Yuu! Don’t surprise me like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe~ Sorry~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, if you’re sorry, apologize properly, seriously…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced toward Umi’s seat, to find both her and Amami-san messing around like usual. They looked a lot closer than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san’s angelic smile and Umi, who received that smile with her own. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, there should be a lot of ways for us to fulfill our real goal, but none of those would have immediate effect like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, whatever. Everything ended well, we fulfilled our goal and I could see the tension between those two had disappeared, I couldn’t ask for more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Umi, what are you going to do today? Doing something back at your home like usual~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? A-ahh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was Friday, the first Friday after the whole mess that started at the beginning of the week.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I love you…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also the first Friday since Umi confessed her feelings to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And of course, as we previously promised, we were going to hang out today too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right… I used to say that as an excuse, huh? …Well, sorry, Yuu, I can’t go with you today, I have a prior engagement with another </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">friend</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another friend? …Then, how about introducing this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">friend</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of yours to me? I want to hang out with them too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry. He isn’t the most sociable person around, so he’ll probably get nervous if you’re there. Besides, we promised to hang out by ourselves. Sorry, Yuu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. That’s too bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Amami-san while sending a glance and a wink in my direction. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Yuu. I’ll make it up to you tomorrow or the day after.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, don’t worry about it. Have a good time~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi left Amami-san’s side and made her way toward me. The classroom was still filled with people and everyone was looking in our direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry to keep you waiting, Maehara.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Doing it like this… You sure you’re okay with this, Asanagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm… I mean, we’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">friends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, no? Isn’t this normal for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">friends</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah, I guess…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we didn’t need to hide our relationship anymore, so might as well show it off, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Agh! Why is it Maehara and not me?!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘…So, miracles do exist…’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder what they&#8217;re going to do after this~?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ninacchi, stop. C’mon, just leave them alone and play with me instead.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Eh~ But I want to know what those two are up to!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi and I quickly walked out of the classroom, leaving everyone behind. We then hurried to my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your hand looks lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that, but she didn’t let go of my hand until we were about to enter my house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s a story for another time…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*  *  *</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, things were like usual. We ordered pizza from the usual restaurant with chicken, fries and onion rings as side dishes along with a bottle of coke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work, Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I’m so tired, I feel like dying. I should skip school next week.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel you. You know, maybe it’s about time for me to use my secret technique.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secret technique?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““The art of feigning illness.””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We said that at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha… Well, I don’t know if I could do it though. Back when my mom found out I caught a cold, she scolded me pretty badly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, in my case, I don’t think it’s worth the effort trying to catch a cold for this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We toasted while telling each other our silly stories before gulping the coke down our throats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later when we became adults, this coke would probably be replaced by beer and we would miss this sweet taste. But that was in the far future. We could still savor this taste for a while longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So, Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About the thing from last week…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahh… T-that… Y-yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brought the topic up as I was cutting up the large pizza.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did confirm each others’ feelings, but neither of us actually talked about what we would do from here on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi said that it would be fine to take it slow, but as expected, I needed a clear answer. Are we friends or lovers, which is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umi, your confession last week… The way you did it, wasn’t it a bit unfair?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umi stiffened as she dropped the fries she was holding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m not complaining or anything, but I felt that way when you did it back then. I’m just wondering what you were feeling back then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Uhm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched her silently as she slowly regained her composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um… You see, I was feeling a bit weird at that time and I did it without thinking… Well, I love you, Maki… Back when we were playing at the arcade, the whole thing with Yuu… Maki, you always prioritized me, thank you, I love you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understandable. Things were a mess last week. Amami-san found out about our relationship, then the whole thing about not hanging out with each other for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well anyway, I did something stupid, really, confessing to you like that… I spent the whole weekend writhing in my bed because I can’t get it off my mind… Seriously, I’m so stupid…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And when you tried to call me, you chickened out as soon as you saw my name in your contact list?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, yeah. I tried to call you to make some kind of excuse, but I chickened out right before I hit that call button.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she told Amami-san all about it and it led us to the whole lover’s hold incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Maki, can I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maki… Do you want to go out with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you want us to be lovers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Maybe…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been thinking about my feelings over the past week and through that, I’ve come to a conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My relationship with Umi started as friends, but at some point, I started thinking of her as a member of the opposite gender. Sometimes the things that she did made my heart beat faster and the desire to keep her for myself rose within me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps, Umi felt the same way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know… I’m a little scared…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation went in a direction I didn’t expect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to talk about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry for being such a troublesome woman…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, you don’t need to hold back, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that Asanagi Umi was a troublesome woman, she didn’t need to spell it out for me.</span></p>
