<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; A Chance Meeting</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made my first friend, Asanagi-san. What sparked our friendship was something unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened after the entrance ceremony, during our class’ first homeroom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">*   *   *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… E-Ewery… Everyone…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sensei, does that mean biting your tongue makes a good first impression ~ ?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The frozen atmosphere in the class eased up the moment a certain female student, whose name and face I didn’t recognize at the time, spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry everyone, it’s my first time being a homeroom teacher, so I’m a little nervous… Anyway, my name is Yagisawa Miki… From today onwards, I look forward to working with everyone, at least until next year… There, I said it all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gee, will we be okay during that time period ~ ?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time, the class broke out in laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The homeroom teacher looked a bit unreliable, but she seemed like the type that everyone would adore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when my classmates teased her, she was still smiling brightly, perhaps she had always been like this since her youth. She probably understood her clumsy nature and decided to embrace it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Yagisawa-sensei was twenty-five years old and had only been a teacher for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, enough about me, you’ll learn everything about me in the future. Today, I’d like everyone to introduce themselves. That’s why yesterday I decided to make this… Okay, pass this over to the one behind you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My classmates passed around the paper they received from Yagisawa-sensei.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Self Introduction Card</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Name</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Previous Middle School</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hobbies</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Likes (Food, people)</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A word of greeting to the class</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I read through it, I sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone will fill out the card. Then I will randomly draw cards and ask that student questions about what they wrote. What do you think? I came up with it after a lot of thought, you know? Now we can easily break the ice for the first hour of homeroom!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were thirty students in this class, so two minutes per person should be enough to fill in the hour. However, for people like me who had been a loner since grade school, this was quite an annoyance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I played games, a minute would feel like it passed by in seconds, but when I had to make a speech in front of everyone like this, that minute would feel like an eternity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since she gave us a two-minute limit, the burden on me just doubled. This is just pure torture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the students complained about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. Introducing your name and where you were from, saying a few words, and being done with it should be enough for a simple self-introduction like this. It saved time and that time could be used for us to properly organize our seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine with this kind of introduction, sensei! I don’t know what I should say when introducing myself, so following your guidance is more convenient for me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thank you! And, you are… um…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Amami, Amami Yuu! Sensei, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone’s eyes were drawn to a certain girl who raised her hand. Of course, mine too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was blond and her eyes were blue. She stood out back in the entrance ceremony and she looked even cuter up close. Saying that she looked like an idol wouldn’t be an exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she stated her opinion, the people who complained immediately shut their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was obvious that this girl would be the center of the class, so no one was foolish enough to go against her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, everyone obediently gave Yagisawa-sensei their self-introduction cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll start drawing them… first up is Amami-san, so, let’s start from you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, teacher! Ask me anything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san was up first. No doubt that she’ll pass this with ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. So, your name is Amami Yuu, well that’s all good, you are from… Tachibana All-Girls Junior High… Huh, isn’t that the prestigious escalator school? Why did you choose to enroll in this high school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it would be better for me to enter a co-ed high school. I mean, I’m a high school student, I do have an interest in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> kind of stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I guess you are at that age huh, Amami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Amami-san’s answer, some of the boys’ faces turned red in excitement. However, contrary to their expectations, I was sure that she would date a handsome guy from another school anyway, so it wasn’t something worth noting. As for me, I’m fine with being a stranger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her other answers were…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hobbies</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Karaoke! I love to sing, so let’s all go together after school!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likes</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Sweets! But I gained weight easily, so I’m currently on a diet…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Word of greeting</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Let’s be friends!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An exemplary introduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boys seemed to want to know more about her, but sadly for them, two minutes passed by quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Yagisawa-sensei called the next student…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next is… a boy, huh, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I would have to wait for a little longer, but I didn’t expect that my part would be right after Amami-san’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara-kun is from Matsubara Junior High…? Where is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s in the neighboring prefecture. I moved here recently, in the winter of the third year of my middle school year. Well, something like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to go into details about it, so I just said it vaguely. My parents got divorced around that time, so I moved here with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, that’s unusual. Then, next would be…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei also didn’t push me for an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My other answers were as follows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hobbies</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likes</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Nothing in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Word of greeting</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">: Please give me your best regards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei seemed unhappy with my answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I really didn’t have any particular likes or dislikes, there was almost nothing I normally did aside from playing games. I did listen to music, read books and watch movies, but those were just pastimes, I didn’t do it very often and I couldn’t exactly consider them hobbies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just being honest in my answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Games… well, sometimes I did play popular games like that certain building game, so that should be fine. But, what did you mean by ‘nothing in particular’? Don’t you have anything to be excited about? Like something you look forward to on weekends…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I do have one thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so you do have something, then, spill it, spill it, what is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actually didn’t want to say anything, but my tongue slipped. Now, it’s the point of no return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since I’m always alone on Fridays, I would call Uber Eats or something and order a pizza or whatever, then, I’ll play games or watch something on TV while drinking some Coke…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…Mmm… Well, this much should be fine…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei didn’t want me to take up too much time, so she told me to go back to my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of my introduction, the class was enveloped in this strange atmosphere, but I was just being honest, who cares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of my classmates had friends from the same middle school, but since I was not even from this prefecture, I had none, add the fact that I was never a sociable guy to begin with, it was inevitable that I would be isolated from the rest of the class, well, Ooyama-kun was an exception, since we would talk quite often. But, in the end, I still spent most of my time at school in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This continued for a good while, until a certain Friday evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I bought Coke at the convenience store on my way home, ordered pizza over the phone, and was lazing around on the sofa in the living room while watching a movie when the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The pizza already came…? No, it shouldn’t be… it hasn’t been that long since I called them…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed the button on the monitor while wondering about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Um, hello, I got some pizza and coke here… Uh… Maehara-kun…? You wanna enjoy them together with me…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Uhh… Asanagi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person standing in front of the door with L-sized pizza and two bottles of 2L coke in her hands wasn’t the usual delivery guy, but my classmate, Asanagi-san, who I’ve never even talked properly with before.</span></p>
