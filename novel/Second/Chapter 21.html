<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Her Familiar Back</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After successfully shaking Nitta-san off, Asanagi and I decided to go to my house first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve sent my address to Amami-san, so she should be able to catch up with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah… This should be far enough… Are you okay, Maehara?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urk… W-what do you think…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hitting your limit already?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa… I hit that limit after 30 seconds of running…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being a recluse did have a negative effect on my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only inside a game that I could be physically active. In real-life, my physical capability was shitty. I was literally holding Asanagi back here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, back at the batting cage, you got exhausted after one swing. Seriously, why won’t you exercise a little bit? Nowadays you can do it indoors, no? There are even games that could help you with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh… That kind of game is tiring, no thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t ‘ehh’ me! If you lack exercise your body will fall apart quicker, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said that as if you’ve experienced that before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My brother was like that, you see? He’s only 25, but he’s already experiencing back pain and such.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Asanagi wasn’t even out of breath, let alone sweating. She ate more junk food than I did, but her body was still in shape, she was amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, on the other hand… While I was thin, if I were to pinch my stomach, it felt pudgy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I should follow in Asanagi’s footsteps and exercise for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, can we go to the convenience store first? I just remembered that we ran out of tea and cakes for Amami-san, and I need to buy other things as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Ah, yeah, what about the Coke? You’re almost out of them, no? We should buy more while we are at it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, we’re almost out, but when did you check the contents of my fridge?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t sweat the details ~ Ah, by the way, the ice cream you left in the fridge tasted amazing. Thanks for the treat ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I forgot that I even bought it, so I don’t mind… But, as expected, you were the one who ate it, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We started our banter like usual as we walked toward the convenience store near my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coffee, milk, paper plates, and tea. I bought everything that I needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next is… sweets, what kind of sweets does Amami-san like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? Yuu said it during her introduction, no? She loves anything sweet and hates both bell peppers and bitter melons. She is childish like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The same as you then… Well, what about this cookie tin? It’s a little bit expensive, but the contents are varied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That should be fine. That’s the kind of sweets that I look forward to whenever I visit a relative’s house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll buy this… Also, put some of those Cokes back, we don’t need </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t ‘ehh’ me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six two-liter bottles of Coke? Are you kidding me? My mom would kill me if she found out I bought that much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I also bought a few other things for us to enjoy on the weekends before going straight to the cashier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everything is 2,944 yen, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urk… As expected the cookie tin is too expensive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got enough money in my wallet, but this much expense might be a little bit too painful for a high school student to bear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’ll pay half of it. Here, 1,500 yen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, most of them are for my own use anyway. Besides, my mom will give me my allowance later, so it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you won’t eat the cookies, right? C’mon, you don’t need to worry about me, just take it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi didn’t show any intent to back down, perhaps she was concerned about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we were arguing like that, the surrounding housewives started to whisper among themselves and their voices entered our ears.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Psst, you see those kids?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Mhm. They’re high school students? They get along really well. Look at them arguing over whether to split the bill or have the boyfriend pay.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, youth! I used to be like that with my husband too, back in the day!’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Huh? Didn’t you first meet him when you both started to work?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, sorry, I was mistaking him for my ex-boyfriend, ohohoho.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Jeez, how could you do that, hm ~?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, just let me pay everything for now, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, y-yeah, sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to split the bill later and just paid everything with my money for now. We then immediately bailed out of the convenience store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, let me carry one of them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, sure, thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I handed her the lighter bag, the one that didn’t contain Cokes in it, and walked shoulder to shoulder with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;From the outsiders’ perspective, we look like a couple, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It seems so. Even if it wasn’t the case, if a boy and a girl got along, people are bound to misunderstand things like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did think that Asanagi and I got along reasonably well. I liked her a lot, but only as a ‘friend’, not a ‘lover’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder why people think that if a boy and a girl got along really well, they would be ‘dating’ each other?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to other girls, Asanagi had a beautiful face, great fashion sense, and a serious personality. I could understand why some boys might fall in love with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, just because I could understand, it didn’t mean I felt the same way as them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever we played at my home, Asanagi always lowered her guard around me. Sometimes, I even got a glimpse of her underwear whenever she raised her legs to kick me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a healthy high school student, so I also think about these things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that didn’t mean that Asanagi aroused me and I wanted to have a go with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me, being able to hang out with her while talking about dumb things was enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Asanagi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is love all about, I wonder…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are going philosophical now, huh? Well, let’s see… I don’t really understand it myself, we are in the same boat in this regard, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Asanagi, who was very sociable, didn’t know the answer to my question, let alone a loner like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a little more distance separating us from each other, we hurried our steps on our way home.</span></p>
