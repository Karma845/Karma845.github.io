<h3>Chapter 43 &#8211; Finally, We’re Alone</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: Dear Asanagi.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: I have your chemistry textbook.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: I’m waiting for you in the courtyard, if you don’t want to be embarrassed in class, come and get it from me, idiot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sent that to her. Of course she still hadn’t replied, but I knew she had read it, so I was pretty sure that she would come to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I waited for her in the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why isn’t she coming yet? Damn it, Asanagi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clock was ticking, the ten minute break passed by quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes left until the break ended… Three minutes… One…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she didn’t hurry, I would be the one who embarrassed myself instead. This is bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, whatever, she would have it worse than me anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh! She replied!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She finally sent me a reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately opened it and found a message with an attached image on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Idiot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I can always borrow the book from someone, you idiot.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image attached to the text was an image of a chemistry textbook. She probably borrowed it from her friend in another class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did she just outplay me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that girl…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forgot that this kind of strategy would only ever work on someone like me, a hopeless loner. I could never borrow something from someone else because I didn’t have any friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike me, Asanagi was a part of Amami-san’s group, of course she would have friends from another class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been seeing her sloppy side so often that I forgot she was one of the more popular girls in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: Come on ~ You’ll be late if you don’t move your ass ~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Maehara: B***h, you’ll pay for this!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Asanagi: I’ll pay for nothing, idiot ~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After sending her my villainous catchphrase, I immediately dashed to the chemistry lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately it was close by, so I barely made it in time. But since I was the last to arrive, everyone in the lab, including the teacher, stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Seriously, why did I do something stupid like that? Now I have to bear with this embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhm, you’re?&#8230; Ah, right, Maehara. You’re late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly sat down at an empty desk and turned my gaze towards Asanagi, who was seated far away from me. She was curled up by her seat, and I could see her body trembling while her seatmate, Amami-san, was giving both her and me her worried looks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, now I’m mad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I swear I’ll catch that dumbass later and pay her back for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara-kun, why do you have two textbooks?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, I accidentally brought a spare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to glare at Asanagi as I gave Ooyama-kun a random excuse. I placed Asanagi’s textbook on the desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest of the classes proceeded smoothly, and the end of the school day arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the sketch was pretty much done, all we needed to do was to make the art for real this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t difficult to make a mosaic. All you needed to do was to make holes in each can, organize them according to the sketch we previously made, connect them with a string, then hang them up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our only problem would be time. If we were to dawdle too much on it, we would have to work overtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the only time when the school allowed us to work at night was the day before the festival. In other words, overtime was not an option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, that could change depending on the decision made by the committee. Nevertheless, I would still need Asanagi’s cooperation to finish this by the deadline. Whether she could even cooperate with me is the real question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heya, Maehara-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?! …Asanagi-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you look so surprised? We have a lot of work to do, right? I just want to make sure that you’re actually starting to work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ah… I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That caught me off guard. She suddenly called out to me, but her tone was formal, so it seemed that she wasn’t planning on letting our little drama hinder our project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">God, I wish I could do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s use however many cans we currently have for the time being. So, where are the cans?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are some in that corner, the rest of them should be in the storage room outside&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Then… We need to carry them here…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s it. I could corner her this way since it would only be the two of us who would go. If I were to press the topic, she wouldn’t be able to dodge it even if she wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, got a minute?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm? What is it, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you go with Maehara to check on the cans? I have to watch over everyone, so I can’t go with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Well, if I could think of a plan like that, she would also be able to, of course. She immediately called Amami-san over to go in her stead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still planning to run away, huh…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, don’t bother Amami-san. She has work to do here. C’mon just let’s go already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, but we were the ones who made the sketch. At least one of us should stay here to watch over the others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It won’t take long, it doesn’t matter. Right, Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. We’re just making holes in these empty cans, after all. We don’t need supervision for this kind of trivial work, Umi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san answered as she secretly winked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san was on my side. We had been cooperating all day. She had been making sure that Nitta-san, Seki-kun and the others wouldn’t interfere with my plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Anyway, I’m going to get the storage room key from Yagisawa-sensei first. Asanagi-san, wait for me there, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, don’t decide it by yourself–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you don’t want to come, I can do it alone…But… I would be glad if you’d come….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;T-then, I’m going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered the ‘I would be glad if you do’ part to her. I walked out of the room and headed toward the staff room where Yagisawa-sensei was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t hear any footsteps behind me, so Asanagi shouldn’t be chasing me, but I knew that she would come to the storage room since I asked her to help me in front of everyone in class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have had her own reason to avoid me. Nevertheless, I still wanted to know why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the key from Yagisawa-sensei and went to the storage room. It was located near the smoking area for the teachers… Yes, the place where we previously had lunch before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the scene from back then came to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, we were really awkward with each other, but we managed to break the ice by exchanging our side dishes. After that, we started talking about cooking and the walls between Amami-san and I started to crumble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, Asanagi. I was late…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously… you idiot…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she had been waiting for me for a while. As soon as she heard my voice, she immediately turned around. The tone of her voice was curt, she was clearly sulking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess this meant that she wasn’t planning to run away anymore.</span></p>
