<h3>Chapter 48 &#8211; Reunion</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school bell rang, signaling the start of the cultural festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our school’s cultural festival was held once every other year and it was a rather big event. The committee made flyers and put them up at nearby stations and the downtown area. The famous alumni also came to give lectures and stuff. There were also live performances to be held here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was why, even though the festival had barely even started, the school grounds were crowded with people, students and visitors alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, are you sure you don’t need to sleep? Yagisawa-sensei said that we can use the infirmary if we’re sleepy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I go to sleep now, I won’t wake up until the festival ends, so no. Besides, it’s my shift on the patrol duty, I can’t just slack off. I might as well forget about sleeping and enjoy this festival to the fullest while patrolling, no?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the committee members, including Asanagi and I, wore green armbands and had to patrol the school grounds. But, even though we were on patrol, we could still enjoy the festival. They allowed us to take a look at the various exhibits and performances and as long as we didn’t eat or drink while on patrol, we were allowed to do it. In other words, we were pretty much free to do whatever we wanted as long as we behaved properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Maki-kun, Umi, over here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, I’m coming! …Right, Maehara, when you’re walking with Yuu’s group, try your best to not be left behind by them, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Got it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I’d end up taking a look around on my own like usual, but surprisingly, I ended up joining Amami-san’s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone looked so excited, even though they also went through a sleepless night like us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked them about it, they said that they did similar things back in middle school, so they were pretty much used to it by now. In other words, I was the weird one, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! Now that Umi and Maki-kun are here, let’s take some pictures together!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pictures? …Ah, with our mosaic, I assume?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! We made it together, after all! It will make a nice memory, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, I haven’t seen the thing yet, huh? They’ve shown me pictures of it, but I still haven’t seen it directly. I guess this would be a good time to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, Amami-san seemed to be more cheerful than usual. Was it because of the festive mood? Or was it because today was the promised day?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, I ended up going along with her group. Also, Asanagi told me that she was feeling nervous because it was also her first time seeing the fruits of our labor directly, but since I was also nervous, there was nothing that I could do to ease her nerves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jeez, that Yuu… Why is she going this far…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What do you mean, Asanagi? Something wrong with Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She is forcing herself to act like that. Just look at her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? She looks normal to me though. Is she really acting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was leading the group while humming a tune, clearly she looked like she was in a good mood. But Asanagi seemed to think otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She has this habit. Whenever she feels nervous she will act unnaturally cheerful to hide it… She rarely did this though… The last time she did this was during the entrance exam, I think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so she is putting on a strong face?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, so even Amami-san could feel nervous, huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the center of the class herself, the girl whose trademark is her angelic face, THE Amami-san herself is forcing herself to hide her nervousness to ease the hearts of people around her. Human relationships are so complex, jeez…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s at times like these that I’m glad to be a loner. I don’t have to deal with that kind of thing and I could just sit down and relax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuuchin, let’s go over there! We should be able to capture the whole art and all of us from this position!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay! Everyone ~ Come here ~ We’ll take our pictures here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once everyone decided on the location, Nitta-san, who was in charge of the camera, lined everyone up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time for me to take a group photo like this, outside of the entrance and graduation ceremony of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, you, Representative-kun! Your position is in the center!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? I’m in the center?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course you are! You’re the main character today, so get in position!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I was well aware that my face wasn’t photogenic, I was planning to hide in the corner of the group, but Nitta-san called me out and made me take the center instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was true that this exhibit was based on my idea, so you could call me the main character for today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C’mon, Maki-kun, don’t be shy~ Come here~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara-kun, c’mon. Come quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place I was assigned to was between Amami-san and Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, I would be sandwiched between the two cutest girls in the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I could feel it on my skin. The gazes of jealousy came from the boys’ side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it couldn’t be helped. They told me to take the center, so I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay! Now, before I start taking the pictures, the main character of the day should wear this ~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? …What the hell is this? A sash??”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably bought it off at a hundred-yen shop or something back when they were shopping for supplies. The sash looked really corny with a huge ‘Today’s Main Character’ written on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that looks good! Wear it, Maki-kun! I’m sure you’ll look great, right, Umi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft… Yeah, she’s right… It looks good on you, Maehara… pfft…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Damn you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi whispered that to my ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amami-san aside, I will make sure to pay Asanagi back later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, okay, I’m going to start taking pictures! So, who’s the main character for today ~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““This guy~!””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They planned this, didn’t they? Since when? Everyone pointed toward my direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, this felt exciting. I had been tense all day because of the all-nighter, but this did improve my mood a whole lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see that this photo would turn out to be something that I would fondly look at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*  *  *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we took our photos, they released me from the main character of the day role, and I got to look around the festival with Amami-san and Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was expecting the other classmates like Nitta-san or Seki-kun tagging along, but they hung out with their middle school friends instead, so we split from them as soon as we finished taking our photos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maehara, good work. Here&#8217;s juice for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we hadn’t eaten anything since this morning, we decided to take a break for a late breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where’s Amami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buying us the food. She said it’s crowded right now, so it will take a while, so just drink this first and wait with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on a pipe chair and took a sip of the juice that Asanagi had brought for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said juice, but it was carbonated, it didn’t taste like Coke though, obviously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, is this melon soda?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. It isn’t the kind of drink I would normally drink, but I got the sudden urge to drink it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Same. I mean, it doesn’t even taste that good, but it has its own charm, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ones they sell in movie cinemas taste good though… Oh, by the way, Maehara, do you normally watch movies in cinemas?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I usually just wait for the Blu-Ray Disc to come out… Or just rent the movie I want to watch…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t mind going there, but it feels strange going there alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, people who went to see movies alone did exist, but they were the minority. The majority of the people who went to the cinemas were either a group of friends or couples. Being surrounded by them made me feel awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so you’ve always been going to cinemas alone huh?&#8230; Understandable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t assume things! …Well, you’re right, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if I were to go there with someone else, there’s a huge chance that I’d be so absorbed with the movie and go on a whole essay fanboying or complaining about the movie. In that case, I would just creeped up whoever I brought with me, and I’d rather not do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm~ Well then, how about we go together next Friday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if they have a good one still airing, sure, I’m down…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was giving her my okay, I suddenly realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next Friday? To the cinema? Just the two of us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, we’ve always hung out together on Friday, but aside from that one time, we’ve never really gone outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be, she was inviting me–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi, you know, isn’t that basically?&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-mhm… Umm–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Umi, Maki-kun! A lot of things happened, so I’m a little late!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““&#8230;””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Amami-san’s voice was echoing through the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, Asanagi now had a sour look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuu, you’re late!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Umi! I got caught up in a conversation… Hey you two, this way, this way~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Amami-san shouted that, two girls wearing a school uniform different from ours appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those two seemed like bona-fide rich young ladies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right, let me introduce you, Maki-kun. Those two are our friends from our elementary–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, Yuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asanagi sighed deeply as she turned her gaze toward the two girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They are your friends, but they aren’t mine. After all, they stopped considering me as their friend a long time ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Amami-san heard Asanagi’s words, she immediately looked at the two girls’ faces closely. Both of their faces stiffened the moment they noticed Asanagi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Asanagi…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm… Well, it’s a little earlier than planned, but I guess this is fine too. Maehara, will you listen to my story? The story about my insecurities.”</span></p>
