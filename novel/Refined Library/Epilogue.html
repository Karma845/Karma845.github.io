<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Epilogue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beginning of the week, Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Makabe-kun? Are you really alright with those hands?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the library after school, Takinami Ruika arrived earlier than usual and had a worried look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On Saturday, I had been with her until just before the incident, and after I came home after the treatment at the hospital, I told her what happened. She told me that she was going to visit me on Sunday, but I refused. She couldn’t stay still, so she came earlier than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be fine. I’ll only do things I can manage.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not much work to begin with. If there was a job that puts a burden on my arms, it would be organizing returned books, but that can be managed by using a book cart or returning books to the shelves little by little without accumulating too many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That so? But don&#8217;t push yourself. You can count on me if you need anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thank Takinami-senpai, who was in her honor student persona.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I say it was a persona, she meant what she said. It goes without saying that she was concerned about me, and when she said I can count on her, she really meant it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she leaned closer to me over the counter. The fact that she called me by my name showed her other side, her true self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she did, she covered her mouth with her palm and whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, I’m wearing the one you selected for me today―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><b>?!</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Should I not mention it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost hit my head on the counter as a measure to calm down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I told you I didn’t need to hear that kind of information. Besides, you’re already implying that you are wearing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t feign ignorance. I know you’re doing this on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that moment when I let out a sigh of exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizu… or not. Ma-Makabe-kun, is there something you… hmm? Takinami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi Shion who entered the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here, Takinami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I was wondering if there’s something I can do to help him, since his hand is like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was one of those who knew her other face, but in front of the public, Takinami-senpai responded with the face of a gentle honor student. She’s really quick at switching attitudes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In fact, she was talking about something terribly unimportant. But she was planning on helping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you, Hasumi-san? Are you also here to help Makabe-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my sarcasm, Takinami-senpai asked Hasumi-senpai back as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Of course not. No way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-7425c64c8c4584e30334a14aa7f64e06 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7425c64c8c4584e30334a14aa7f64e06"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was also mean. If she asked in such a teasing manner, there was no way Hasumi-senpai would have been honest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was probably right. For what it was worth, she has been assisting me with inconveniences at home as well. However, Hasumi-senpai was perhaps embarrassed to admit it, and quickly denied it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, what are you doing in the library, then? Would be the question asked next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-well, but you know, you can put it that way. I will help </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">my little brother</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">his older sister</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, so you can go home, Takinami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai turned the conversion around ― if you get hit, you hit back. Though, it must be hard to tell a lie when it was painfully obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlike you, Hasumi-san, who can help him bathe, I can only see Makabe-kun at school. At least let me take care of things at school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would never do that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She would never, that kind of thing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and Hasumi-senpai shout at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? I thought you would do that much for him. It must have been hard to wash your hair by yourself, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, now that you mentioned it…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be fooled, Hasumi-senpai. Takinami-senpai is just having fun teasing you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was with that face? Even before and now, she was surprisingly an easy person. Takinami-senpai probably realized it too and was teasing her on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai came back to her senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I’m sorry. But, it’ll be fine if you put on a swimsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them stared at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as for me, well…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s disturbing the other students, so I&#8217;m going to ask you both to leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to kick these girls out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pre-bell rang at 5:55 p.m and I went to Mibu Kanata, who was sitting in her usual seat, just as the remaining students began to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was running her pen through her notebook as usual. Her style of writing was as analog as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru. Somehow, it was kinda rowdy half-way through.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s not gonna stay for long.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to get this arm healed fast to keep those two quiet. However, I don&#8217;t think it was something I can achieve through hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have one report to make. I think I will be staying with the Hasumi residence for a while longer.”</span></p><div class="zetro-f07d59b0021d53f213062321d249e0b8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f07d59b0021d53f213062321d249e0b8"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Kanata-senpai&#8217;s reaction was nonchalant. She seemed not a tiny bit interested, and she then began to put her tools and notebooks away in her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Aren’t you pleased?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Again, what are you expecting out of me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a very cold response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had a feeling this was going to happen. Besides, I know that my relationship with you will not change regardless of where we are. Even if you leave this place as planned, nothing will change. Since it&#8217;s you anyway, wouldn&#8217;t you just fly over from the other side of the world if I told you to come?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s true. We have known each other for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I met Kanata-senpai when I entered middle school.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This marks the fifth year already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re surprisingly more cowardly than I thought, not being able to forget your first woman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, um, Kanata-senpai? I’d like you to reconsider how you phrase it, okay?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my face twitch. I can never let people hear this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s about the level of expression. I can rephrase it, but it doesn&#8217;t change the essence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai, however, was easygoing. Not seeming to mind my inner impatience, she continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going out after the exam. You should follow me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, with pleasure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Kanata-senpai said so, I had no right of refusal, and there was no reason for me to refuse. For Makabe Shizuru, Mibu Kanata was such an existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, my relationship with Hasumi-senpai has changed dramatically in the past month. We went from being a senior and junior who only knew each other&#8217;s faces to siblings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My relationship with Takinami-senpai may change in the future. I have told her many things, but since I like her, I felt that there was a good chance that it might change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what about Kanata-senpai?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she was right, after all, no matter what the situation was, our relationship will never change. That was how ideal our relationship was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unchanging relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was something wonderful ― yet at the same time it was somewhat regretful.</span></p>
