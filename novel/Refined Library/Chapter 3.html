<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Chapter 3 - Act 1: Daily Attacks In the Library</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later, my smartphone buzzed during class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was a rule to keep mobile devices turned off during class, only few students follow it. As long as they switched it to silent mode, did not make any loud noises, or become engrossed in operating their devices while the teacher was talking, they were not likely to be caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a glance at the teacher and took my smartphone out of my pocket. The notification on the lock screen was a chat from a messaging app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sender was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was an unusual thing for her to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, she doesn&#8217;t put much emphasis on this kind of communication, at least not to me. The main reason was that she knew my schedule &#8211; in the classroom during the day, in the library after school, etc. &#8211; and she could catch me quickly. If she has an urgent business outside of school, she would call me. Thanks to this, there were not many logs in our convo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also surprising that she, who goes by the attitude of an &#8220;honor student&#8221; on the surface, would not turn off her device during class and send me chats like this. I guess she was also a high school girl after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you going to the cafeteria for lunch today?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was such a short message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I made sure that the teacher wasn’t looking, I quickly replied back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That’s the plan.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I didn&#8217;t bring anything, I had no other choice. There was also the option of buying something at the store, but I didn&#8217;t really want to go there during lunchtime when students were swarming like zombies to buy bread and juice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, how about we eat together?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now comes the invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So, I should take Naoi with me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I want to eat with the two of us alone.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don’t really mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I decided to ignore it for now. It probably won’t result in an absurd situation. [T/N Famous last words]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Alright.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then, I’ll see you at lunch break. I’ll be waiting.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">End of the chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I was astonished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Having lunch together with Takinami-senpai? Gimme a break…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I failed. I was distracted by something else and became a yes-man, missing the gravity of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I put my phone that has served its job away in my pocket.</span></p><div class="zetro-be86c380347a7f5fcfd60c235b5267a6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-be86c380347a7f5fcfd60c235b5267a6"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe, done messaging?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the teacher&#8217;s voice came flying in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was our class teacher, Asaba Seijuro. The subject he taught was mathematics. It didn’t really fit, considering his name that sounded like it came out of a period drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has a slight beard, unkempt hair, and a loose-fitting cutter shirt, but he doesn’t look messy. Perhaps, like his favorite subject, mathematics, he calculates his style.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you have a lot going on in your home, but focus when you’re in class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems he knew what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a homeroom teacher, it was only natural that Asaba-sensei was one of the few people who knew about the family situation between me and Hasumi-senpai. Uncle visited the school and explained exactly what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, he was not being conscientious about my complicated situation right now, but he was a man who can be reasoned with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your consideration. I admit it’s quite hard, but I’m just having a chit-chat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s even worse.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded like I didn’t do something wrong, Asaba-sensei let out a loud yell, and the classroom erupted in laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good grief. What should I do with you… Next time I’ll confiscate it, you hear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There probably won’t be a “next time” though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, it was lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped. I should go.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke while trying not to be heard by those around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe, you’re going to the cafeteria today, right? Let&#8217;s go together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Naoi Kyouhei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a bit taken aback, as I didn’t expect him to approach me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. I have a prior arrangement with someone today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-alright.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered, he looked slightly surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Makabe―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the heck? I thought if Makabe was coming along, I could talk to Takinami-san and the others again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another guy spoke, interrupting Naoi, who was about to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t joke around. You guys are already on talking terms. Even if I&#8217;m not there, I bet they would talk to you guys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. This is also thanks to you, Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guy laughed as he said this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, even without the incident the other day, this group would have found a small opportunity to talk to them. They were great at communicating after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on. Let’s go, Kyouhei-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another guy rushed out from the classroom entrance looking exasperated. It was also the one who was glaring at me the other day. The cause of his irritation was probably not Naoi, who was reluctant to go to the cafeteria, but most likely me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah, I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi turned around once to check on his friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe, maybe next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he met up with his friends who were waiting for him. They walked to the cafeteria with their usual group in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to their destination too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be somewhat awkward to follow right behind them, so I walked at a distance from Naoi and the others. Eventually, they arrived at the cafeteria and stood by the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a quick glance, it appears that Takinami-senpai was not present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if she came first and started eating, that would be considered rude as the person who invited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Makabe-kun. Did you wait?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking, a voice came.</span></p><div class="zetro-6f1841330c8df736f055658c1d65cafd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6f1841330c8df736f055658c1d65cafd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw Takinami Ruika standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I just got here myself as well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I answered, I quickly looked around her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she was alone. I wondered if she would come as a group, contrary to the words in the chat, but that didn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the other day, the air in the cafeteria changed with the appearance of Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Takinami-senpai apparently ate lunch at the school cafeteria, her appearance here must be a daily occurrence. Even so, the reason why she attracted so much attention must be because some of the students do not usually have contact with her and admire her from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today, there was quite a stir. The reason being Takinami-senpai, who first spoke to me as soon as she entered the cafeteria. They would wonder, ‘Who’s that guy’ or ‘Why him?’, something along those lines. Well, I had imagined this would have been the case…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, that message earlier. Was that really you, Takinami-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked surprised when I asked her, pretending not to notice the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, how sharp. Yes, it wasn’t me. How did you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Intuition, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just thought that the message sent to me was somehow unlike Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was done by Takajou-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takajou? Ah, that senior who had a strange s*x appeal.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled the girl I once met in this very place, a woman that has a very tempting voice and atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun, do you like that kind of girl?… I could probably do it as well. Shall we try it next time?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I humbly refused Takinami-senpai, refraining from saying such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As one would expect from Takinami Ruikai, who has embodied the expectations of those around her. However, if she were to spread that kind of atmosphere, there would be no way of stopping her…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a shame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled, perhaps amused by my panic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Takinami-senpai&#8217;s urging, we got in line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, Takajou-san took my phone out of my bag during class and sent it without my permission.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What were you even doing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m so stunned that I can’t even comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, the fact that a message was sent in the middle of class was one of the reasons why I felt it was unlike her, since she was an honor student and all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the phone lock?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have one because it’s too much of a hassle. There’s nothing bad to be seen after all. Let’s see… I’ll set it up if we go on a date and take a selfie together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People will misunderstand if they heard you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, a female student who was standing in line right behind her heard it and was startled. Besides there was no misunderstanding, Takinami-senpai was serious to begin with. Probably.</span></p><div class="zetro-f9372201e76023ab8e37ada2a156603e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f9372201e76023ab8e37ada2a156603e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it was sent without your permission, couldn&#8217;t you have just corrected it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought It was fine since it gave me a chance to eat together with you. It was no inconvenience. Even so… I’m surprised you figured out that it wasn’t me just from that short message. That makes me happy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai had an innocent smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, we got our food, put it on the tray, and took it to an empty table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, the surroundings were in a stir. It was probably because Takinami-senpai and I were seated at the same table. ‘Why are you with him?’ or  ‘What kind of relationship do they have?’ I kept hearing such voices. I let out a small sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hold it in for now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, who saw this, lowered her tone and spoke, and I responded in a dismissive manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was saying that “No matter what those around might say, once you agree, you must take responsibility and stay with me until the end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly a voice descended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This voice sounded familiar. I looked up, and standing there was, as I had expected, Takajou-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you dining together with this fellow over here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Makabe-kun, a member of the library committee. I&#8217;m always grateful for his help, but I thought it would be nice to meet him outside the library once in a while. I wanted to thank him for all the help he’s given me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the thanks is ‘a lunch together with me’, is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai spoke mischievously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, it’s not like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai replied with an embarrassed laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, enjoy your time… And it’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Librarian. I’m Takajou Miyabi. I’ll drop by the library next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please. I’ll be waiting.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded amicably, Takajou-senpai smiled with her oddly erotic sexual appeal as usual and walked away &#8211; but then she put her hand on the table and pulled her face toward me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun, I’ll play with you some other time, okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You say that, but you’re just gonna use me as a hook, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I won&#8217;t be fooled twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, cat out of the bag?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She just wanted to catch a big fish like Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if you want, I can play with you in a place where Takinami-san isn’t around. Or would you want my social media account? Of course, it has my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hobbies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takajou-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai&#8217;s voice came flying in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I immediately caught one again. Well, then… enjoy your time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-9a64e9d32c4c2a735ae85299afc61b58 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9a64e9d32c4c2a735ae85299afc61b58"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai left the table once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned towards Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was that just now?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I then asked in a low voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of strange things going on. Since Takajou-senpai should know me, there was no need for her to go out of her way to introduce herself to me. Besides, she was the reason why this meeting was set up in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s what you call creating an alibi. An alibi to let other people know why we are together right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, got it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The point was that I’m a member of the library committee and Takinami-senpai wanted to talk with me outside the library, so she had Takajou-senpai tell that to other people. In fact, a lot of surrounding students who were listening had an ‘Oh, so that’s it?’ expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In retrospect, it appears that this was what she meant earlier when she said &#8216;hold it in for now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since she did that without my permission, I took the liberty of having her help me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled mischievously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At any rate, since we usually only talk over the counter or while going home, this feels refreshing, don’t you think?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai uttered those words as if to regain her composure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you ask me, that is true. Moreover, she usually comes in a little before closing time, when the number of people has decreased, so we never had a long talk like this with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll have to thank Takajou-san for that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of her, she’s currently waving at us.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Takinami-senpai&#8217;s back, Takajou-senpai met my eyes and gave a small wave in front of her chest so that no one could see. In addition, she also struck a peace sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, I’ll make sure to tell her off later.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked dismayed and annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you on good terms with Takajou-senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… Curious? Well, she certainly got the appeal.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied with a nasty smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not what I meant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can introduce you if you’d like. But… I don’t want to lose, so I might mimic her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aren’t you already doing it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who was it that sat on the counter the other day?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t remember it very well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, Takinami-senpai laughed, giving a very nice smile. How terrible. But it must look like she was having a blast watching from the sidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this conversation that took place while both parties knew each other&#8217;s true face was somewhat amusing, even if it was a bit bland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may sound like I’m repeating myself, but I don’t dislike Takinami Ruika, who has a two-faced personality.</span></p><div class="zetro-8b3b3101ecaacec7d4e36c32bb1137e5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8b3b3101ecaacec7d4e36c32bb1137e5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, you know, the social media account that Takajou-senpai mentioned the other day…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahー&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Takinami-senpai suddenly looked sour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s such a headache, but it&#8217;s true. Only a few people know about it, including me.”</p></span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was lost for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The account of Takajou-senpai&#8217;s hobby, in other words, an account that posts naughty selfies, was apparently real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Won’t she get found out?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She said she’s hiding her face, so there’s no problem about that. She also orders uniforms from overseas so she won’t get found out by the school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Takinami-senpai not only knows about it, but has seen it. Her voice contained a certain note of admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like it costs a lot of money, and I am certainly impressed. I wonder what on earth she was doing with her calm appearance and ladylike Japanese name. No, in a way, wasn’t it a fit for her oddly erotic sexual appeal? On the contrary, it made me curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing my mind, Takinami-senpai looked quite annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get any ideas. I&#8217;ll do that much for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too, don’t get yourself all worked up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a moment&#8217;s pause, I retorted in a straightforward manner. There was a previous offense, so it wouldn’t end lightly if she took me seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as we were eating and talking, forcing the delicate atmosphere back to normal, some students came up to us. Some were friends of Takinami-senpai and others were acquaintances of mine as a member of the library committee. And each time, Takinami-senpai would give the same explanation that she had just given to those around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, some of them were Naoi and others who had arrived here earlier than me. Naoi gave me a fresh, handsome smile and said, &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, you should have told me so,&#8221; and the others treated me like a traitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai also stopped by again on her way back and said, &#8220;Enjoy your time,&#8221; with an elegant smile that suggested her well-bred upbringing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as the lunch break was coming to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah….”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a sound when I saw it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai. She came into the cafeteria with a few of her friends and turned to the vending machine corner by the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai tilted her head at my suspicious behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s nothing…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was wrong of me to be so vague in my reply. She twisted her hips and turned herself toward the direction I looked at. And then she noticed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, well…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai nodded, as if she was convinced of something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She doesn&#8217;t have the s*x appeal of Takajou-san, but she has a great style. Sounds like your type.”</span></p><div class="zetro-0c6e1ba22beccc903ef55be96b093eb3 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0c6e1ba22beccc903ef55be96b093eb3"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you not turn me into one of those people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied with a sullen smile, she giggled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. If you were that kind of guy, this would have been a lot quicker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, if I can be seduced by enticement, I would have been taken down by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I somehow followed Hasumi-senpai with my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bought a drink from a vending machine, took it out of the machine, and picked it up &#8211; she then turned around and noticed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was startled for a moment, but quickly decided to dismiss it as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She doesn’t change, huh…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled inside my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, somewhere close by, an electronic sound was heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takinami who responded. She took out her own smartphone and fiddled with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, she let out a sound, looking dismayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was from Takajou-san. She said ‘Stop chatting around and come back.’ You’re not my mom, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even as she puffed her cheeks out, Takinami-senpai typed a short message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it’s true I have to leave early since we have to move classrooms. It’s already this time, so we should go back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We got up from our chairs at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, a lunch break that was different from usual ended.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Act 2</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day after school, as I was sitting at the library counter as usual, a rowdy group of people came in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of four.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw them, I was startled. I was surprised to see Hasumi-senpai among them, and this was also our second encounter today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, why do I have to tag along―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on. Don’t be such a killjoy. Besides, we&#8217;ve come this far already.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai seemed uncomfortable entering the library and was complaining a lot. A petite girl was pulling her hand. That said, she must be a senior as well. The other two girls were pushing Hasumi-senpai’s back. The two were grinning, as if they were amused by her reluctance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, seniors? Could you please lower your voice in the library?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although not many people use it, it was still a library. I had to warn them if they were being this loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person who was pulling Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s hand smiled bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, on the other hand, was silent. Of course, it was not because they were warned, but because she met me. She knew I was here and that&#8217;s why she didn&#8217;t want to come here in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See, we need to be quiet… All we need is to find one book, right? It won’t take long with these numbers.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright! Alright!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai’s group passed by the counter and disappeared toward the shelves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently watched them go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if it will be fine. Do they know where to look? I was a little worried, but decided to leave it alone for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after some time later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can’t find it at all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird. I thought we would be able to find it right away… I’ll ask the teacher again later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what I thought. They went to the shelves without checking the location of the book, and naturally, they wouldn’t be able to find it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was the use of a library committee if I were to stay silent here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re looking for a book, you can find it with the computer there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to them as they were walking past the counter and pointed to a computer nearby for searching the library&#8217;s books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that will tell you where to look.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I can guide them to this point, I have passed as a member of the library committee. And it seems that a good librarian was one who goes one step further at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you looking for Manyoshu by any chance?” [T/N Ancient Japanese Anthology]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-9f566e76683360a1f032b8d5e3d431e8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9f566e76683360a1f032b8d5e3d431e8"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seniors who were about to follow my advice and head for the computer turned around in unison at my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For Tanaka-sensei, native japanese.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep! Big Tanaka!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The senior said with a joyful laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our school has two Japanese language teachers named Tanaka. One was Tanaka Masaru-sensei. He was so large that the students call him &#8220;Big Tanaka” to distinguish between the two. [T/N Masaru can be read as “dai” which meant big or large, students can’t really call their teachers by their first name so they had to compromise with “Big Tanaka”]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, How’d you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Students have been borrowing Manyoshu a lot these days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I caught one of the students and asked him about it. Apparently, Tanaka-sensei(Masaru), the teacher in question, had talked about the era name in class and recommended the Manyoshu anthology in connection with the current era name. The students who were interested in the book kept coming to borrow it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like to keep track of what&#8217;s going on when I see unusual activity like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aforementioned librarian also said that it was the librarian&#8217;s duty to watch what was going on in the world and be ready to provide books and information accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh, that’s amazing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The senior was in awe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, there are different kinds of Manyoshu.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see. Any recommendations?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do but… it’s currently on loan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a shame.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shoulders slumped dejectedly comically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it’s gonna be a while before it will be returned. If you make a reservation, I&#8217;ll set it aside for you when it&#8217;s returned.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. I’ll make a reservation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now she looked up energetically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, please write your―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, as I reached for the reservation form on the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s too much trouble. Tell me who&#8217;s borrowing it now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She demanded looking sullen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she doesn&#8217;t like the fact that my advice was readily heeded by her own friends. Even though she knew there was nothing wrong with that, she still wanted to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akane said she would decide whether to borrow it after taking a look at it. It&#8217;s not too late to ask the person currently borrowing it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said that but…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-a31a786392513244ad9b049b85551c27 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a31a786392513244ad9b049b85551c27"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A senior called Akane replied in a troubled tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Hasumi-senpai. I can’t do that. It would be a breach of personal information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Borrowing history was personal enough information because it was linked to hobbies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not very flexible, I see. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not the point, telling you is the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was adamant on arguing, and while I met her gaze head-on, I refused her demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a standoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other students had never seen Hasumi-senpai like this and were horrified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, everyone, what’s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then another voice came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew who it was just by the sound of her voice, and I let out a sigh inwardly. What a time to appear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone in the room except me turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. Standing there was, of course, Takinami Ruika. Perhaps sensing the strange atmosphere, she tilted her head with a dubious expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied with a lingering grumpiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? I hope that’s the case.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai walked up to the counter with everyone&#8217;s eyes on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing her. She must have read the mood of this place and was acting completely oblivious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, the return date was still a little away, but I&#8217;ve finished reading it and came here to return it. As expected of Makabe-kun’s recommendation, it was certainly easy to read.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she put a book on the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now the book was the center of the limelight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that’s…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somebody let out a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book that Takinami-senpai returned &#8211; it was the Manyoshu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about this book?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was just recommending it to these seniors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asked and I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? What a coincidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled as if all was well.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I asked him to tell me who borrowed it, but he wouldn’t budge. He’s so inflexible.”</span></p><div class="zetro-502395c84ead762e2375ae59acbfa8f8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-502395c84ead762e2375ae59acbfa8f8"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This should have settled the matter, but then Hasumi-senpai didn’t stop, as if to put a damper on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, Takinami-senpai pondered for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, it may seem inflexible, but apparently that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re not supposed to do as a librarian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that how it is?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The senior who was called Akane asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard there was a scene in an old drama where the heroine, a librarian, checks out the borrowing history of a guy she&#8217;s interested in, and there were protests from the industry. They said librarians don&#8217;t do that and it was misinterpreted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. You sure know a lot, Takinami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun told me about it… It needs to be managed carefully, so you should understand his position, right, Hasumi-san? He’s quite diligent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if you say so, Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai asked for understanding, Hasumi-senpai nodded her head reluctantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Then, Makabe-kun, lend it out right away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first step was to return and process the Manyoshu, which was returned by Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a library card, senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I&#8217;m pretty sure I made it during freshman year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school produces library cards for students who wish to borrow books only. It was not unusual for students who have no connection to the library to remain without a library card until graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this senior had not already made it, I would have had to start there, but it appears not to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, found it, found it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the senior pulled out a library card from among the student handbook. When I received it, her name was written in the name field as “Shiiba Akane.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scan the barcode on the card, then the barcode on the book. The book was now ready to be checked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your patience, senpai. The due date is two weeks from now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks. I’m Shiiba Akane. I’ll be back again, so pleased to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thanked me as she introduced herself, showing me the face of the card, and left with Hasumi-senpai and the others, looking satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if this will add another user to this lonely library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ll have to wait and see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope so, but the problem was that the library might be closed unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s a little complicated to think that there will be more girls targeting you, Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have nothing to worry about. As a member of the library committee, I treat everyone equally. Including you, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I let her words go down the drain, I suddenly looked towards the doorway and saw Hasumi-senpai looking at me. She was probably just about to close the door. As soon as she realized that I had noticed her, she immediately closed the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-67b9bf2077dfae16f6eef5d708223702 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-67b9bf2077dfae16f6eef5d708223702"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the library was about to close and all the students except Kanata-senpai left the room as usual, Takinami-senpai came to the counter and called my name in a casual manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you notice anything strange about Hasumi-san earlier? I&#8217;ve never seen her behave in such a manner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bet. Hasumi Shion would not behave like that unless she was dealing with a person she doesn’t like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;She doesn’t like me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which was me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you do something?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. I didn&#8217;t do anything in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you&#8217;re good at getting around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai let out an exasperated sigh.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can certainly see my own position objectively and know what kind of facial expression will not make the other person uncomfortable, what kind of remarks will make the conversation go smoothly, and the best solution at any given moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But not in her case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai cannot forgive my very existence. After all, it was proof that her father betrayed her mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, denial of existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as it was not about something I did, I cannot solve this by standing up for myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you buddies with Takinami-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it was just me and Hasumi-senpai in the living room, she suddenly questioned me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not long ago, the three of us, including Hasumi-san, were having dinner together. When we finished eating, Hasumi-san went into his study to do some research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai started to wash the dishes, but of course, I was not allowed to help her, and going back to my room seems like I was pushing that job onto her. I had no other choice but to watch TV that had nothing but uninteresting shows, although it was also as bad as just going back to my room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Hasumi-senpai finished washing up &#8211; and as she returned to the living room, she asked the question mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She comes to the library often, so we talk over the counter.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai gave a somewhat skeptical nod and sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dressed in loose-fitting long pants made of soft material and a T-shirt, sitting cross-legged on the sofa. It doesn’t look pretty for a girl, but when Hasumi-senpai does it, it looks strangely elegant. I know she might get mad but… it looks very manly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what was that about?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai then asked more questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About what?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were eating lunch with Takinami-san, weren’t you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah, that one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, she turned away the moment she noticed me, but she seemed to be paying attention to her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She invited me since we only talk inside the library. I started eating at the cafeteria just recently after all. Besides, she said it was thanks for always giving her recommendations and finding books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee, you’ve been doing that for Takinami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about? That&#8217;s the job of the library committee. I also did the same thing for Shiiba-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that so? So any girl will do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like she was terribly misunderstanding something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I want to retort a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if I go out of my way to talk to everyone, there’s no way a girl will fall for it. Besides, aren’t you the one who said I look below average when I babble my mouth open, Hasumi-senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t take that seriously. It&#8217;s a joke, naturally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied while agitated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, is that so…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I was bewildered by her sudden backpedal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. It was a joke. However, how should I interpret her words? Objectively speaking, I think I don’t look half bad. Is it safe to assume Hasumi-senpai also thinks the same?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut your mouth.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my mouth, Hasumi immediately shut it down without a moment&#8217;s pause.</span></p><div class="zetro-f66531b8453dc480b6668e9caefd687f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f66531b8453dc480b6668e9caefd687f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Typical men.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as inelegant it was, she snorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You better bring it quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch box. You can’t exactly keep eating at the cafeteria, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No? I don’t see any reason not to ― but I stopped, since I didn’t want to argue with her right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we fall silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t exactly go back to my room at this point because it would look like I was running away ― In the end, I endured the uncomfortable feeling for a while.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">§§</span><span style="font-weight: 400">§§</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was now getting late ― 22:00.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that time, I went downstairs with a mug of coffee in my hand that I had been drinking in my room, thinking of taking a bath and getting ready to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what―,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a voice, Hasumi-senpai’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it didn&#8217;t seem to be directed towards me, and for that matter, she wasn&#8217;t even standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she talking to uncle? But he disappeared into his bedroom a short while ago, after dutifully saying goodnight to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, who was she talking to?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grew curious and looked for Hasumi-senpai. Although it was a large mansion, it was still just an ordinary home. I soon found her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tatami room. In front of the Buddhist altar there, Hasumi-senpai was sitting cross-legged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mom, did you know about dad’s affair?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to call out to her, I quickly hid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe you knew about it. You’re like a bodhisattva, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was speaking to her deceased mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We previously talked about whether or not Hasumi&#8217;s mother knew about uncle&#8217;s affair. At that time, I answered that she would have to ask uncle directly, but it seems that Hasumi-senpai decided to ask her mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course there won’t be an answer ― this was just her talking to herself. Then I shouldn&#8217;t listen any longer. With this in mind, I was about to turn back without making a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I now have a little brother.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My footsteps came to a halt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I was little, I think I probably annoyed you by saying I wanted a little brother or sister, but I never thought it would come true this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, he wasn’t cute at all. He’s pretty good looking if he just stays shut. But, he likes to run his mouth off.”</span></p><div class="zetro-7ef59018ba40abfa4159d1032bdf54e7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7ef59018ba40abfa4159d1032bdf54e7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leave me alone. I’m quite fond of this self which can get along with anyone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m the one who’s not cute at all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She spilled the beans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it in my head. Yet, I can’t help but… you know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she might say next was clearer than water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My appearance must have been painful for her, who was capable of maintaining friendly interactions with a wide range of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, she had no choice but to hate me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel bad for clouding the face of Hasumi-senpai, who was always happily smiling at school. I came here to make Hasumi-san feel better, but I guess I shouldn&#8217;t stay long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind again that as soon as the summer vacation rolls in ― I would leave this place.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Act 3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got ready for school in my room and went downstairs afterwards. In the living room, Hasumi-senpai, who also looked ready for school, was reading a book on the sofa. She was supporting an open paperback book with one hand while her other hand was resting. Her legs were crossed and she had glasses on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dressed well and I was captivated, seeing her in glasses for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai seemed to have noticed me and asked with her eyes still on the book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you wear glasses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only when I’m reading a book or studying.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks good.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The frames were squared-shaped. The way she reads a book silently, far from her usual friendly demeanor, gave her this intellectual image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not very flattering. It’s not all that cool after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai snorted and laughed bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you chose something that suited you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really. I’ve never thought about it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you are going to wear it anyway, why don&#8217;t you choose carefully? If you wear earrings or piercings to school, you’ll be scolded, but glasses on the other hand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I looked again at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about oval frames? It will give your face a gentle look.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure. I have a grumpy face, I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said while sulking and closed the book she was reading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then looked this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know a lot of weird stuff, don&#8217;t you? I mean, you have an interesting onlook on things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, is what I would like to say, but that’s just knowledge passed down from a girl in my class.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After being exposed to her ideas, I wondered what it would be like to look at glasses from a fashion point of view, so I did some research, and here we are now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s attitude changed drastically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?! Another girl? Ah, I knew it was going to be something like that… Come on, get going. You’re gonna make me late too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shooed me away. Apparently, talking about girls was finally becoming a taboo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was driven out of the Hasumi residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short walk, I arrived at Myodani Station on the Seishin-Yamate Municipal Subway Line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I descended the stairs and stood on the platform, the doors of the train that was there just closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-ca7428342c0becc8b68f4b774b4a7920 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ca7428342c0becc8b68f4b774b4a7920"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made an audible voice as I watched the train start to run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I messed up the calculations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have left in time to catch the train. I was talking to Hasumi-senpai and it ended up eating up a little time, but I thought I still had plenty of time to spare, so I didn&#8217;t think that kind of time loss would have made me miss the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, I looked at my watch. It seems like that train was not part of the schedule. If it had been midnight and I had gotten on the train, it would be a great start to a horror show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I looked at the electronic bulletin board. There was a message on it, telling that the schedule was disrupted due to an accident… I see. I understood the situation well. If the train was stopped, it would be a big problem, but it wasn&#8217;t, so I could just take the next train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for ten minutes, the next train arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would make it unlikely that I would be late. That was fine, but the place was terribly crowded. Perhaps the number of passengers per train had increased because of the reduced number of trains due to the disrupted schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got into the train with the flow, pushing and shoving each other, twisting their bodies in an attempt to advance one step deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, it’s too crowded…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice that was mumbled, which was not directed at anyone, reached my ears clearly because it sounded familiar to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully turned around, and there was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, you’re here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai rolled her eyes and I vaguely replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Hasumi-senpai, who left the mansion after me, caught up to me due to the schedule disruption, and we ended up on the same train. I was standing in front of her, of course, and Hasumi-senpai was probably operating her smartphone or something and didn&#8217;t notice me standing in the same line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The car is currently very crowded. Our apologies. However, please proceed to the back of the car.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the moment the announcement was made. The density in the car increased, whether it was passengers rushing to board the train or passengers trying to go to the back as just announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyaa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai came in close contact with me from the front, emitting a voice that was rather cute even for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sorry, I got pushed from behind…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, who was looking down, and Hasumi-senpai, who was looking up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was right in front of mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A breathtaking distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So close that you can see your reflection in the other person&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">““</span><b>..?!?</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”“</span></p><div class="zetro-3257a1b1de887ad47a710d7381b1167e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-3257a1b1de887ad47a710d7381b1167e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a moment&#8217;s delay, we were surprised enough to jump as we processed the situation. But even if we wanted to leave, it was too crowded. We could not take even a single step back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sorry, but, bear with it for a little…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai rested her forehead against my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like what she said earlier, “Bear with it” should have been what a man ought to say… or not. We’re in close contact. The distance was zero. Thanks to this, something soft was pressing against my body to the extent that it changed its shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s kinda impressive to what extent its shape can change…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I calmly wonder if I am escaping reality or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just been shown the greatness of it the other day, but I didn&#8217;t think I would be able to experience it again at this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a sense, I may be the one who was forced to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was probably aware of this and knew that I was also aware of it. Still, I must not say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were two stations from Myodani to Gakuentoshi. It takes only a few minutes to get there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Sogoundo-Kouen station in between, as its name implies, has a stadium, baseball field, and a park, but there were few riders in this station during the commuting hours. Thanks to this, the situation remained almost the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a large number of students got off at the Gakuentoshi. Everyone was gossiping about what happened earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We also got off the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked out of the ticket gate side by side without saying a word &#8211; and that was when I finally came to my senses. Just because we happened to be on the train together, there was no need for us to go to school together. In fact, we had to go separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to quicken my pace when,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mornin’~, Shion-chan and Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A person interrupted with a greeting I&#8217;ve never heard before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That did not mean that she interrupted with words during the conversation. She literally and physically interrupted me and Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She poked her head out from between me and Hasumi-senpai and looked at our faces alternately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you two together?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Shiiba Akane-senpai.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, are you in the middle of apologizing since you caused trouble yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, that was not the case, nor did she apologize last night. Rather, it was quite the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who will?! I was just―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean you were being mean, but in actuality―”</span></p><div class="zetro-9571735c9d6ddc77ab0e9a3c356aa638 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9571735c9d6ddc77ab0e9a3c356aa638"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen to what I’m saying.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai laid out her own imagination and speculation, causing Hasumi-senpai to scream out in frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Librarian-kun, Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Shiiba-senpai brilliantly ignored Hasumi-senpai, and this time she turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you can see, Shion-chan looks like a guy, but she also has a girlish side, so please take care of her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you calling a guy?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, don’t worry. You don’t need to remind me, I can see that she’s a girl through and through.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too! What are you saying!?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was busy getting angry at Shiiba-senpai, complaining to me, and moving her face left and right, or even up and down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I&#8217;ve said something unnecessary. Let&#8217;s change the subject. I don&#8217;t know what kind of misunderstanding Shiiba-senpai would make if left unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiiba-senpai, have you already read the book you borrowed yesterday?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, hahahaha.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That reaction gave me a rough understanding of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet you’re the type of person who would be satisfied when you get what you want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I meanー”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she pouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, on the side, Hasumi-senpai opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I know that feeling. I buy the manga and novels I want, put them on the bookshelves, and be done with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a waste…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This one seems to be the same type, but what she was doing was dynamic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t think you can read it, let me know. I&#8217;ll recommend you another one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was easy to read was much more subjective than one might think. Some people prefer a general explanation as an introduction, while others are more interested in an explanation with some solidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, when I was really about to go, somebody held my arm firmly. It was Shiiba-senpai. She was trying to not let me go by wrapping her arm around my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be so overly considerate. Let’s go together.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai shook my arm in a teasing manner. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the same as Hasumi-senpai’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright. Then, we’ll go together.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably had to answer like this, or else she won&#8217;t let go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I had to go to school with Hasumi-senpai, even though I needed to avoid her.</span></p><div class="zetro-6a35db623129a7854f7aca8441b8b782 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6a35db623129a7854f7aca8441b8b782"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gee, why do I have to go with you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t look at me. I also don’t know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai voiced her complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice sounded like she wanted to complain about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What made you think I’m feminine?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahー&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unintentionally let out an audible sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I must have said something unnecessary. What made me think that was probably the incident in the train a few minutes ago or when she came out of the bathroom the other day. Of course, the same goes true for her everyday loungewear, but I realized that the two most impactful events were the first two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really want to hear it? Maybe if you heard it, it might cause trouble later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I suppose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai seemed aware. Just as when she got off the train, she seemed to have decided that it would be better not to mention this topic any further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shiiba-senpai, who heard the inexplicable conversation between me and Hasumi-senpai, looked at us in turn again and said a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Buddies?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, we’re not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai immediately denied it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? As I recall, don&#8217;t I have a similar misunderstanding with Takajou-senpai?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do they think I’m buddies with either of the pair jewels of our Akanedai High School?</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Act 4</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Friday of that week, after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, as usual, there were only a few students in the library, and so far it has been peaceful. As I was sitting at the counter, doing some work that the teacher asked me to do, I suddenly heard a rhythmic shuffling sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and glanced around the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I saw was Kanata-senpai. She was in her usual seat by the window, making her pen work as usual. Today, there were several books piled up around her, so she may have come here to do some historical research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a sleeping boy student. Well, as long as he was not bothering anybody, I&#8217;ll tolerate him sleeping in the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And―found it. A female student with white earphones in her ears. She must have started listening to music on her smartphone or something. Normally, I would have just ignored it, but if she was leaking sound, it was a different story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had her back facing the counter, so I went up to her and called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? What is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She responded by removing one earphone from her ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you please turn the volume down a little?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way. You heard it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A little.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth was it wasn’t just a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then lowered the volume. Afterwhich, she put the earphones in her ears again and went back to her stuff. It seems she was studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, there are various people who go in and out of the library. Students who borrow books and go home. Some don&#8217;t borrow books, they just read them. They would come back later and read the rest of the book. Some teachers would borrow a few classic literature books to introduce in class, while some students don&#8217;t touch the books at all and just sit at their seats and study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to the counter now that the case had been settled, a female student came flying into the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey thereー, Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she came in, she called out to me with such enthusiasm that it was doubtful that she had properly identified me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when I thought there would be some peace, here she comes. I almost wanted to hit my forehead against the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gestured for her to be quiet and she understood what she did wrong. Then she came to the counter, skipping her feet. She didn&#8217;t have to do that, though, because the floor was carpeted, so footsteps barely made any noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Shiiba-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">That female student was Shiiba Akane-senpai. Today, she was alone. Hasumi-senpai, who was with her the other day, and the other senpais weren’t with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I came to return this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then handed me a copy of the Manyoshu that she borrowed the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You already read it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. It was too complicated, so I couldn’t read it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai said in a casual manner. However, she did read it, but it probably just wasn’t for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there anything less complicated?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-21bd01fd134a46ff87aa5c98d0c18d19 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-21bd01fd134a46ff87aa5c98d0c18d19"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that she has not lost interest in it. Then, as a member of the library committee, I had to respond to her desire to read. I figured this would have been the case, so I did some digging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a manga version.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you take me for?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that reaction is expected.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I was joking, and Shiiba-senpai was also laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about the one that has the original text and the modern translation side by side? I think it would be easy to read.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that would be nice.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the next book has been selected, I start the return process on the Manyoshu that has just been returned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scanning the barcode on the cover, an icon of a layaway slip illustration appeared. This book has been reserved. Clicking on the icon would print out the form. I clipped it to the book and placed it directly on the book truck where I would place the reserved materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then after, I check the status of the book Shiiba-senpai wants to borrow. As I recall, no one is borrowing it right now… Ah, I knew it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll go and get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, thanks.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the counter and headed for the classic literature section. I quickly found the book I wanted and returned with it in my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me see… Ah, yeah, it looks reable.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai flipped through the pages and expressed her impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you borrow it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. I’ll take my time reading through it at home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then quickly pulled out her library card this time. It seems she simply had shoved it in her skirt pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I receive it along with the books and check them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re quite dependable.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s my job.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when the book and the card were back in Shiiba-senpai&#8217;s hands again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too slow!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A third-party voice, not mine or hers, interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, it was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Shion-chan. I invited her to go to you, Librarian-kun. But she didn&#8217;t seem interested, so I left her alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, that type of invitation might never work with Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai, for some reason, looked triumphant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufun. I knew you’d come.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-640a7c5774cc6fd6a6a943b6e3710606 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-640a7c5774cc6fd6a6a943b6e3710606"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean you knew?! Don’t get any ideas!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai got angry with her eyebrows raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really a misunderstanding, not a failed attempt to hide (or pretend to hide) her fondness for me unlike Takinami-senpai did, so it must be upsetting for Hasumi-senpai to be misunderstood that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say something too, Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also want to see you, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m gonna smack you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied with a straight face. She meant it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just kidding… We’re really nothing what you imagined.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I was just picking you up since you’re taking your sweet time in the library, Akane.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was clearly upset, but Shiiba-senpai does not seem bothered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, look. I was recommended another book. Isn’t it nice?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really… Come on, let’s get going.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai happily showed the book she just borrowed, while Hasumi-senpai looked grumpy in contrast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably didn&#8217;t want to come to the library because she didn&#8217;t want to see me at school, but she also didn&#8217;t enjoy leaving her friends with me, so she came all the way here reluctantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I must be partly to blame for her grumpiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, what a lively day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And came another voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if it were the reenactment of the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve been meeting here quite a lot, don’t you think, you two?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled, as if she was pleased with this coincidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you come here often, Takinami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, Hasumi-senpai asked a question looking to probe, and Takinami-senpai nodded her head in affirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must love books, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As much as everybody else.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was nodding and appeared to be thinking about something, she then turned to Shiiba-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akane, go on ahead. I have something to talk about with Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-d804c83585156d972c5da859e58f1a98 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d804c83585156d972c5da859e58f1a98"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai looks at Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s faces alternately in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she seemed to have convinced herself somehow. After looking at the two of them and me again with some concern, Shiiba-senpai left the library. Don’t look at me. After all, I don’t know what to expect either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai confronts Takinami-senpai once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s your intention, Takinami-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai asked a question that lacks specificity, to which Takinami-senpai pondered for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, her expression slightly changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I quite like Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai’s demeanor is just like when we were alone together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shi, Shizu?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, when it’s just the two of us, I call him by his first name. But, he wouldn’t call me by my first name.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looks at me, a little dissatisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To have him keep me company. That&#8217;s why I come here often.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My response will still be the same, even if you keep coming back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at him.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what she said. Rather, it was the opposite. She giggled and laughed, since she found it interesting when things don’t go as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, of course, I borrow books from time to time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, on the other hand, was opening and closing her mouth. It was probably because of the appearance of Takinami Ruika she had never seen before, and also learning about the unexpected relationship between me and her. Or perhaps it could also be because of my cold attitude towards Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, Hasumi-senpai somehow manages to calm down and squeeze out a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t get it. What&#8217;s so good about this guy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru and I are of the same kind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai proudly declare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Same kind? How so? You two are nothing alike.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it would appear so, wouldn&#8217;t it? But no matter what anyone says, Shizuru and I are the same kind of people. That&#8217;s why I think we should be together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hmm.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai responded with a blank stare, or perhaps feigned to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, suit yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I’ll suit myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-6401af8b28e49ff6e3973261586dd934 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6401af8b28e49ff6e3973261586dd934"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai paused for a second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is what I’d like to say, but before I do―Hasumi-san, last time you were poking fun at Shizuru, and same goes for today… Do you perhaps like him?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?! Of course not!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai voiced her dismay, as if she heard the most outrageous thing ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily look around. I thought that having the two most famous female students representing Akanedai High School together and arguing with each other would inevitably draw attention, but fortunately for me, only a few people were still present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were only three people left. A boy who had fallen asleep and was still sleeping, and a girl who was listening to music. Neither of them seem to have noticed anything unusual. Kanata-senpai was the only one left, but she didn&#8217;t seem to be paying any attention to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, despite her agitated attitude just a few moments ago, retracted her hypothesis surprisingly easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-san, you don’t seem to be childish… Then why do you always poke fun at him?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That has nothing to do with you, Takinami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. It has nothing to do with me. But if you say that, it’s also none of your business what happens between us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai fell silent after being hit on a sore spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was natural. That kind of selfish logic where you would interfere and not expect to be interfered as well was not going to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, no matter whether I make a move on Shizuru or not, can you please stay out of it, Hasumi-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Takinami-senpai was intentionally provoking Hasumi-senpai. I don&#8217;t think she really suspects that Hasumi Shion has a liking for Makabe Shizuru, but she may have felt that she was hiding something and was trying to pull it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the reason Hasumi-senpai was poking at me was simple. Because she hates me. And because she doesn&#8217;t like the fact that I’m getting along with someone else. In other words, Takinami-senpai was like a fly on the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no way to say such a thing, and Hasumi-senpai had no choice but to back down ― as she should have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We do have a connection.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it seemed she was going to shut her mouth, she suddenly springs into action with a disapproving look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it was bad news. I thought I had to stop her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Because this guy is my step-brother.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai let out a small audible voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked irritated. Was she angry about the fact, or was she unwilling to speak out about it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence fell between us three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure make some pretty funny jokes, don’t you think, Shizuru?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first one to speak was Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me for agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-5d954c083a65bd66a35f991a98a098d4 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5d954c083a65bd66a35f991a98a098d4"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a puzzled voice escaped her mouth. It was because I had my face on my hands and  was sighing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am very sorry, Takinami-senpai, but what Hasumi-senpai said is undeniably true. She and I are now siblings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around the room once again as I looked up. No one was paying attention to us. Thank God… indeed. She told me not to say anything, but she was the one who spilled the beans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What does that… eh? Is that how it is?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she arrived at the answer in the middle of trying to ask a question. It saves a lot of explaining to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, I only had to say one phrase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quite…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fact is stranger than fiction, as one might say, and here it was. Even Takinami-senpai seemed to be at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But wait. If that&#8217;s the case, that doesn’t explain why you&#8217;re poking at Shizuru. Doesn’t look like your cute little brother was giving you bugs or something…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai barked once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course. I wouldn’t do that anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you before. I’m being hated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hated?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Takinami-senpai did not seem to get the point, and tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was obvious that I’m an eyesore, having been born as a testament to her father&#8217;s betrayal, and having even moved into the house on top of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I’m saying is―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth to try to explain to Takinami-senpai however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Not really. I don’t really hate you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai and I looked back at the same time, but she turned away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How unpleasant. I’m heading home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying a few words, Hasumi-senpai left the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She must have mixed-feelings about it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said while staring at the doorway where Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s back had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Especially when you’re like that, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although our relationship was a bit tangled, the feelings held by Hasumi-senpai were quite straightforward, or are they not?</span></p><div class="zetro-94af3dd7b7d48c610a46b462fbdc003c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-94af3dd7b7d48c610a46b462fbdc003c"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing my lack of understanding, Takinami-senpai let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to go back home with Takinami-senpai on a whim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was too late since she already heard everything, I explained again the relationship surrounding me and the Hasumi family along the way since there was nothing to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my explanation, she seemed to understand and mysteriously nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We talked while standing side by side, holding on to the train&#8217;s strap, and only whispered, considering the topic. In such a crowded train, you never know who’s listening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, are you by any chance staying at her house?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had kept that part of the conversation a secret, but she seemed to have caught on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last time we went home together, you stopped at a different station.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you have guessed. I’m currently staying at that person’s place.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were still whispering and avoided mentioning the name of the definitive person. Thanks to this, our conversation was all about &#8220;she&#8221; and &#8220;that person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After my mother died, her father suggested to me to stay at his house. I thought it would make him feel better, so I decided to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s very typical of you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai laughed a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Respectively, we were considerate of each other’s feelings. Or, to put it in our own way, we’re reading the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she couldn&#8217;t accept me. Well, I guess that’s only natural. So I&#8217;ll leave when the semester ends and summer vacation begins.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave? Do you have a plan?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fortunately, my grandparents called out to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In these times where it wasn’t easy to add another family member to feed, they were probably half-serious about it. However, since I have nowhere else to turn to, I’d just have to take on their offer even if they were half-not-serious about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it close?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, it’s quite far.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, my grandparents came to the funeral by bullet train and stayed overnight at the funeral lodging facility to attend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait. Doesn’t that mean you’re gonna transfer school?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I suppose it’s going to be that way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai asked me in a meek voice, I finally realized what that meant, albeit belatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I accept my grandparents&#8217; offer, I will certainly have to transfer out of my current school. However, it was also not certain that I will be attending a new high school, so I am not sure if it can really be called a &#8216;transfer&#8217; in the correct sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s, not good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not good? Why?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Takinami-senpai let out a sigh of exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen, Shizuru. You may think I&#8217;m just a clingy girl, but I consider you a good friend before being a romantic interest, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stated as if to remind him.</span></p><div class="zetro-a8a8ee43954af0a0d4fdf22bf39e4852 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a8a8ee43954af0a0d4fdf22bf39e4852"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that friend is gonna be gone. Isn&#8217;t it normal to want to do something about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;My bad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, while I have no desire to be in a relationship because of my personality, I do think she was a senior whom I get along well with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know how you feel, but don&#8217;t do anything stupid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Senpai asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like convincing ‘that’ person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded to her, she let out a small &#8220;Oh,&#8221; as if she suddenly had an idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think I need to do any convincing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? That person clearly hates me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Convincing her to accept me should be the quickest way to break through the status quo at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She doesn’t hate you. She said it herself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what I don’t understand, I should be hated.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it shows in her attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai doesn&#8217;t like me, and she doesn&#8217;t like me having fun with someone else, especially with a friend who is close to her. So she intervened between me and Shiiba-senpai, who trusted me as a member of the library committee, and she even came forward to Takinami-senpai and said she was my sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like I said, she&#8217;s got a lot on her mind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that really so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think that those who suddenly appear as their father&#8217;s illegitimate children and come to the house uninvited were easy targets of contempt and hatred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I think I’d leave it to you to do something about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leaving it to me? What do you mean? I’m not gonna do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was someone who shouldn’t be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she&#8217;s your sister, isn&#8217;t she? Are you really sure about keeping things this way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think this is common for sisters and brothers who don&#8217;t understand each other. Especially if they are half-siblings and were not even informed of each other&#8217;s existence until recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was something in what she said that stirred something within me, and that&#8217;s why I kept quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also I will miss you if you’re gonna be gone, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked sideways at Takinami-senpai, who was mumbling, I saw that she had her face straight ahead, her eyes fixed on the scenery flowing outside the car window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, putting aside how you feel, it&#8217;s not healthy to be in this state of incomprehension with a sister who is half, but not quite, blood related.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I replied, an announcement was made in the car.</span></p><div class="zetro-8316c185b586441d13bf344979fe9935 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8316c185b586441d13bf344979fe9935"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next was my station, which was a little closer these days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">§§§</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you tell her yourself when you told me to keep quiet about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up will you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Hasumi-senpai replied sulkily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The location was the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle came home early today, so the three of us ate together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was impossible to have a lively meal with such a mysterious composition of father and daughter plus a mistress&#8217;s child, and the conversation was in bits and pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, Hasumi-san was constantly speaking to me, and I could sense his desire to somehow make it easier for me to stay in the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle was currently in the kitchen, in the middle of washing dishes. He said he would do it himself, and Hasumi-senpai left it to him without saying anything in particular. It seems that it was not her job because she was his daughter or she was a girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was currently wearing long pants and a T-shirt today. The level of exposure may depend on whether or not her father was present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, who was sitting on the sofa with her elbows propped on the back of the sofa, turned around to face me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think Takinami-san will spread it? I was being quite intense after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked as she leaned forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re so worried about it, you shouldn&#8217;t have poked and prodded from the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. She’s not that kind of person.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Thank goodness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sunk into the sofa, patting her chest in relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rather, it’s the other people beside her who might.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she wasn’t paying attention to it until I told her at this very moment, and Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s face turned blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, fortunately, no one noticed us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th-that’s great to know…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was shaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does this person not realize that she was a celebrity? I don&#8217;t think this kind of good fortune would last long. One wrong move and it would be a catastrophe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right. I remember.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She raised herself up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean, ‘We only talk over the counter’ you guys look like buddies.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would you believe the truth if I told you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-d2559c51065e5b0e78924d50e401702a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d2559c51065e5b0e78924d50e401702a"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an immediate response, but I don&#8217;t feel particularly inclined to say anything back because I would feel the same way if I were in Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s shoes, or for that matter, as a third party to the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, what? Are you guys dating?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s not like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has been courting me, but I have been rejecting her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you go out with her? You&#8217;re a lucky guy, you might never get that again in your lifetime, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s an awful thing to say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she was right, so, once again, there was no room for argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no intention of doing so at this time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai curiously asked back. It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of luck, and she probably doesn&#8217;t understand why I didn’t try to grab it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a matter of fact, I wonder how many boys would shake their heads if they were in my shoes. Unless you were a good-looking guy with a lot of confidence in yourself and others, you would only be put off by having a beautiful girl like Takinami Ruika next to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in my case, it was for a much different reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to be having a lot of fun talking. What are you guys talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-san who unintentionally interrupted the conversation. He walked from the kitchen to the living room. He seemed to have left the washing up to the machine, and the dishwasher was running noisily on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s huff, the expression on her face quickly faded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing fun at all. It&#8217;s none of your business, dad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she got up from the couch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for washing up. I&#8217;m going back to my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so she slipped past uncle and went up the stairs leading to the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was that about?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle murmured as he watched his daughter&#8217;s back disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was that? It was obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s natural friendliness made it easy for her to talk with most people and get them excited. Yes, even with me. But at times, she would come to her senses. Saying to herself, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t have this kind of relationship with him.” and quickly switch her attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess it must be complicated in her mind, because she can inadvertently talk well with someone she should hate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You and her are close in age, so I thought you would get along well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-san may be smart enough to have become a doctor, but unfortunately, I must say that he was quite naive. Or was it that the perception of male parents toward their daughters is the same everywhere?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it normally, I don&#8217;t think it would be a good idea for a high school girl to suddenly be made to live with a boy close to her age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-san seemed concerned about whether he was doing a good job as a father.</span></p>


<h3 style="text-align:center;">Act 5</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The incident occurred the following Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, Uncle was away due to his job, so it was just the two of us, Hasumi-senpai and me, during breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with that face? Since we’re in the middle of a meal, why don&#8217;t you at least put on a cheerful face?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? Who was it that said to just keep my mouth shut since I looked better that way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I was hiding it pretty well, but apparently it showed on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Did something happen?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, who couldn&#8217;t bear to look at me, asked me reluctantly. I couldn&#8217;t help but answer, having been seen in a depressed mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was fired from my part-time job yesterday.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was working on a small part-time job, mostly on weekends. However, I was given a short break due to my mother&#8217;s death, and then I forgot to contact my job due to the subsequent chaos, and as a result, I was fired without warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need to find a new part-time job soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, this was just me trying to fill the conversation in. If I’m going to leave this place in the near future and go to my grandparents, there would be no point in looking for a part-time job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, Hasumi-senpai spoke up, looking relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, that’s a shame. Well, you can just stay here. My dad will take care of most things, so you won’t have to worry about money for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I didn&#8217;t understand what she said. But when I understood that it was sarcasm, I gradually became angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t come here for the money. I came here because I was called. I also didn’t just do my part-time job for money, half of it was more of a hobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but glare at Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, the fact that I came here to alleviate various immediate problems, and the fact that I didn&#8217;t get as much allowance as others my age were getting because I had a part-time job &#8211; I swallowed the words of rebuttal that I was about to spit out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Hasumi-senpai was flabbergasted &#8211; and her expression changed to one of regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She understood more than I did about the meaning of the words she had uttered, and bit her lip in regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was about to say something &#8211; but she swallowed her words like I did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, we continued eating in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was the first to finish her meal as she munched it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for the food. I&#8217;ll clean up today. When you&#8217;re done, put the dishes in the sink and go on ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She quickly spoke and went up the stairs from the living room to the second floor as if she were escaping.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">§§§</span></p><div class="zetro-1218123063a044c93fc8ec816b009649 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1218123063a044c93fc8ec816b009649"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school that day, just as the library was about to close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what happened today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reported this morning&#8217;s incident to Kanata-senpai for advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, Takinami Ruika came in again today and left after a short conversation. Except for Kanata-senpai, all the other people had left the room, and the chime for 6:00 p.m. had just rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it was just me and her in the library after operating hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai was looking up at me from her seated position while her chair was facing me. She was still reticent as ever and had a cold expression on her face, which made me feel chills, but this was just how Mibu Kanata normally was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scene looked like a teacher had called a student in the faculty, more so when she was leaning her whole body at the backrest and her legs were crossed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have every right to be angry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I shouldn’t be angry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do you think that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you’re a man? Or is it because you’re a mistress’ child?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Neither reason justifies it. If anything, it&#8217;s the lowest of low to despise someone just because of such relations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a sound argument. It was however…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That being said―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, Kanata-senpai rearranged her legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From what you&#8217;ve told me in detail, Hasumi seems to think she said something she shouldn&#8217;t have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sure that her expression and behavior at that time were due to the fact that she tried to apologize, but in the end was unable to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think I should do?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Kanata-senpai for her opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let her apologize. Set the situation up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quite difficult.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should be able to do it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad she trusts me, but she made it sound like it was easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Create a situation where Hasumi-senpai can honestly apologize… huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, how should I go about it― As I was pondering what to do, Kanata-senpai uncrossed her legs and turned her entire chair around. She began to put away her pens and notebooks that were scattered on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Kanata-senpai―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-7056c2b44be03d457880a1437be3f6ae zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7056c2b44be03d457880a1437be3f6ae"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called her out, she responded, but didn&#8217;t stop moving her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don&#8217;t cross your legs or recross them in a situation like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was a good thing that I was standing there and couldn&#8217;t see it, I couldn&#8217;t help but be curious about it. No, in this case, it would be more accurate to say that it was precisely because I cannot see it that I was concerned about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s on purpose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unexpected answer made my eyes widen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other day, Takinami was doing something similar, so I decided to copy her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you inviting me by any chance?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that what it looked like?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I somehow managed to keep my composure and asked back, Kanata-senpai, who had just finished packing her stuff, looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah. I bet you’re just teasing me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you got it right… I’m going home. Don’t forget about the matter with Hasumi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Kanata-senpai left the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I worked on closing the room and left, thinking about the propositions I had been given along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it was about Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, I came up with a few ideas, and after I meet with Hasumi-senpai, I should be able to bring it up based on the situation and the flow of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or at least that was what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was all for naught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, Hasumi-senpai didn’t return home.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Act 6</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to the Hasumi residence, the front door was unlocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I entered inside, I couldn’t find Hasumi-senpai anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Had she gone for a walk or gone to the convenience store? She didn’t lock the door properly, how careless. I waited for her to come back, but there was no sign of her coming back at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, uncle returned first and I had to explain the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he heard my story, he immediately called his daughter&#8217;s phone. But there was no answer. She probably had it turned off or decided to ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle eventually gave up, put down his phone, and looked at me, who was watching the situation from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate to say it, but I think Hasumi-senpai ran away from home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cause was obviously me. She must have run away from home because she couldn&#8217;t stand the situation of having a mistress&#8217;s child at home. She must have been so irritated that she accidentally uttered that sarcastic remark this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ran away from home, huh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle murmured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the time being, we’ll wait it out for today and talk to the school tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so he finally sat down on the couch for the first time since he got home. He was shocked by his daughter&#8217;s behavior which he didn’t expect, and he sat there looking truly tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is truly not easy, Misato…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That name―Was it Hasumi-senpai’s mother?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked down at his figure as I stood there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was the reason Hasumi-senpai ran away from home. Hasumi-san, who brought me here, may have a remote cause, but the main reason was me. If that’s the case, I need to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please wait a little while before contacting the school. If it spreads, it will be difficult for Hasumi-senpai to come back. Can you leave this to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was actually quite easy to solve this problem. All I had to do was just say to Hasumi-senpai, &#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to stay here for a long time.” If she wants, I can leave right away. I had already made up my mind, so I should have just told Hasumi-senpai first. If she knew about how I would only stay for a month, she might have been able to tolerate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have something in mind?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she doesn’t have any other friends outside of school, I suspect she might be staying at her school friend’s house.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had attended a prep school for the university entrance exam, she might have made friends outside of school, but as far as I could see, it didn’t seem that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the question was how would I find and meet Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day at lunchtime, I called Takinami-senpai to the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I borrowed the key because I wanted to clean up the bookshelf during my break time, although that was just the pretense. I lightly sat on the table closest to the counter and waited for Takinami-senpai to come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She arrived shortly after, looked around once to make sure I was the only one in the room, and finally opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong, Shizuru? What’s with the sudden call?”</span></p><div class="zetro-637ac307ae78c3273bc2c26d7a8b6797 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-637ac307ae78c3273bc2c26d7a8b6797"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a few questions for you, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because no one was present. She was very frank from the beginning, and I responded accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From the looks of it, it doesn&#8217;t sound like you’re repenting for your past behavior and want to be in a relationship with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it mischievously, but her face was not smiling. She knew what kind of situation she was in. So I continued on with my story without responding to her joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you guess who Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s closest friend is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was in a different class from Hasumi-senpai, and they had never been together in either 10th or 11th grade. So, I’m not sure if she could give an answer, but she was the only one I can rely on at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the factor was only being a 12th grade student, Kanata-senpai would suffice, but that person was a recluse writer who has no interest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would probably be Shiiba-san who you saw the other day too. Even if it’s wrong, I&#8217;m sure it would be someone from that group.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the first step would be to contact Shiiba-senpai. Since I managed to gain a certain amount of trust from her in the Manyoshu case, she was a relatively easy person to talk to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did something happen with Hasumi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I hesitated whether I should answer or not. However, it would not be fair to her after getting the answer I wanted and leaving her in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open my mouth with only truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai is missing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Missing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai repeated my words. Then she put her finger on her chin, and with a thoughtful look on her face, she murmured to herself, &#8220;Come to think of it, I heard that she was absent due to cold or something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it possible that she had an accident outside?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think so, because there was no message or call after a full night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We ruled out that possibility from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m pretty convinced she ran away from home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ran away? Did something happen at home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course something did. And it’s my fault.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What else could it be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was me! If I hadn&#8217;t gone to that house, Hasumi-senpai wouldn&#8217;t have left! I wouldn&#8217;t have made her say those heartless words! It&#8217;s all my fault!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hit the table three times while biting my lower lip after realizing my mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai immediately calmed me down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, Shizuru. It&#8217;s not your fault that Hasumi-san left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On what basis?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-c0abdc1d20209fe8694e20cdb0aa1b27 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c0abdc1d20209fe8694e20cdb0aa1b27"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More importantly,”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She interrupted my attempts to refute her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re gonna look for her, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye-yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right. What I needed to do now was not to argue about where the blame lies or how foolish I am. What I needed to do right now was to find Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are quicker ways to find out where Hasumi-san is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai let out something unexpected. Does she know something that I don’t?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just call them up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I could, I wouldn&#8217;t have a hard time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became irritated and retorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, it was an alternative that could not even be called an alternative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you called her since she disappeared?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uncle called, but she didn&#8217;t pick up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai then let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, she will pick it up if it’s from you, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, she stated it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I doubt it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just call her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know her number.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where does that confidence come from? But before that, I had no way of contacting Hasumi-senpai in the first place. I really should have asked her if I knew this was gonna happen, since we had talked about it once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re siblings, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked astonished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Siblings that were born just yesterday, you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you.” “Then let&#8217;s exchange contact information right away.” If such an exchange were possible from the start, this situation would not have happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No other choice. I&#8217;m pretty sure I have her registered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Takinami-senpai began to operate her smartphone. Apparently, they had exchanged text chat IDs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[Shizuru will call you.] and send.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sent a message immediately.</span></p><div class="zetro-9e9199f51efe18d285b90a3a5c7db51f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9e9199f51efe18d285b90a3a5c7db51f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she didn’t send a message to “Answer the phone” or something. Perhaps she wanted to leave that to Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s judgment, or perhaps she wanted to prove that she would answer the phone if I called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Call her after a little bit of time has passed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai uttered. She then pulled out a chair close at hand and sat down. I sat down lightly at the table as she did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru. Do you really think Hasumi left because of you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai suddenly asked a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What else is there?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you say it yourself? That it&#8217;s not good without understanding things? Have you talked to her about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We got interrupted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After dinner that day, I had a great opportunity to talk with Hasumi-senpai, but while I was in the middle of a conversation, uncle intervened and that opportunity was squashed. I also missed another opportunity, and that was yesterday morning. What in the world am I doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai softly smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you’re like a child when you look troubled. You&#8217;re so cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you not?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you saying at a time like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a good opportunity. Talk to Hasumi-san about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, like an older person, said as if she was an older sister telling her younger brother what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, this is her number.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps thinking it was about time, she showed me the screen of her phone. There was Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s name and her contact information such as phone number and email address were displayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at it and half-heartedly tapped the number in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason for this tedious process was probably because if I were to call them out of the blue, there was a good chance she would ignore it since it was an unknown number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, after a few calls,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s grumpy voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really picked it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was speechless, not expecting for her to really answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You know, you called me because you had something to say, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. Um… you should probably head back home. Uncle is also worried about you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no reply from Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not long after.</span></p><div class="zetro-194d0a0b5db7a617667f20b9bcece66d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-194d0a0b5db7a617667f20b9bcece66d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, I suppose. He’s my parent after all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered why she would do such a thing even though she knew what she was doing. In my mind&#8217;s eye, I could see Hasumi-san looking down with his head in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can we meet and talk?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of such complaints, now was the time to talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t mind. When and where do you want me to go?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At six o&#8217;clock this afternoon, in the school library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s reluctant question, I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The library closes at 6:00 PM. Unless it will be a really long talk, I can just say that the closing process took a long time as an excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Alright.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied shortly and hung up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It looks like she agreed to meetup.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Takinami-senpai. Just by listening to my words, she must have had an approximate idea of how the conversation went.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You owe me one. I&#8217;ll have you go out on a date with me sometime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you think Hasumi-senpai would answer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I neither nodded nor complained about her words, but instead asked her a genuine question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It means that Hasumi-san isn&#8217;t as close minded as you think, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the answer I got back. Takinami-senpai laughs while saying that “You are the only one who doesn&#8217;t get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think so either.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Act 7</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school that day, just before 5:55 p.m, I went to Kanata-senpai, who was sitting in her usual seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Kanata-senpai. Could you leave a little earlier today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up at me and asked, as she smoothly dragged her pen through her notebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there something going on?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of her appearance and atmosphere, and her nickname as the “Empress”, I felt as if I was being asked, &#8220;Who do you think you’re talking to?” However, Mibu Kanata was just this sort of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai will be here at six o&#8217;clock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi will be here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t that a common occurrence these days?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re going to have to talk about something complicated. Actually, she ran away from home yesterday. We&#8217;re going to meet and talk about it here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi ran away from home, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai murmurs, I was unsure whether she was interested or not based on her expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday means that the trigger happened that morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps that must have sent her into a terrible self-loathing feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think it&#8217;s your fault that Hasumi left?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How very perceptive. No, you only had to do a little bit of thinking and you’d be able to figure it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-senapi said the same thing to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care who said what. What I want to hear is what you think, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s harsh.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Katana-senpai. I was cut down in a single blow. [T/N Yes, it&#8217;s not a typo.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I do. I think Hasumi-senpai thought of me as an eyesore and left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded like a desperate man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai then let out a sigh of exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re able to break things down and analyze them, but you lose your cool when it comes to yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. No, rather, I think you’re too calm. I have been worried about that ever since we first met, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What you value the most is harmony. You could and are able to choose the most appropriate course of action depending on the situation, but it always goes in the direction of harmony. I think you’ll willingly choose to be the bad guy if it’s in order to make things better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re thinking too much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-616a4ce2bbc71ab87c87a27a31d86d73 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-616a4ce2bbc71ab87c87a27a31d86d73"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to say that even I do not have that much spirit of self-sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just for the record, you know this is a family matter, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai stated it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then started putting away her notebook and tools on the table. It was quite spread out, but it wasn&#8217;t long before it was shoved into her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Kanata-senpai. What on earth do you mean―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wish I could answer that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai interrupted my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, the next moment, the bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After waiting for it to end, she opened her mouth once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, a certain library committee told me to leave early.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sound so desperate. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t make you out to be that kind of man</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed, but sounded somewhat dismissively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see. If I had to say something―you just need to look at yourself calmly and objectively as usual and see where you stand right now. That would solve the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai put her words together, and then she left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because she was always the last to leave the room, the two or so remaining students, perhaps mistaking the earlier pre-bell for the main bell, followed her out of the library in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was the only one left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Hasumi-senpai was punctual, she should be here in less than five minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stated it clearly and Kanata-senpai said it implicitly. That Hasumi-senpai didn’t leave because of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Am I wrong then?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was I wrong about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was too little time to think about it, and Hasumi-senpai showed up just before the main bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came into the library, she was in her school uniform. Has she been like that since she left home, or did she go back home to change clothes? Either way, civilian clothes would be too conspicuous, so it was natural to be in a uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Hasumi-senpai entered the library, she first looked around the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did everyone leave already?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Takinami-senpai didn’t come today. It’s just me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p><div class="zetro-8d80d0bdfbcc9c9bbed019f02e96bbbd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8d80d0bdfbcc9c9bbed019f02e96bbbd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason she was not here today wasn’t because I told her to do so. If she had wanted to be present, she could have come for a number of reasons. But today, Takinami-senpai didn’t show up here even once after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah. It looks that way…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai abruptly said―then her words were cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I guess it was my turn to speak. Since, I was the one who called her here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after coming this far, I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few minutes ago, I had decided what I was going to tell her. However, that fragile will was crushed by Takinami-senpai and Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai. When I was wondering what I should say, she initiated the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I left at a peculiar time. You probably thought you were the cause that I left, right? Since you’re diligent.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But the fact is―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s dad that I can&#8217;t forgive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai interrupted me and stated firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He betrayed mom and had a child with another woman, and kept quiet about it until mom died. And then he invited the child he had with his mistress home and acted like he was doing something good. I can&#8217;t forgive my dad for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai let it out all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, realizing something, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, don’t misunderstand. I know you’re not at fault.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was caught off guard by her words, and I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t give me that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked at me and laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think you did something wrong? You were just born out of your mother and our father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That may be true. But I&#8217;m proof of her father’s betrayal. Am I not someone she should hate? If Hasumi-senpai thinks that she cannot forgive uncle, even more so me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, sure, I was annoyed by the way you were hanging out with women here and there, just like dad. In that sense, you may have been somewhat responsible for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a terrible false accusation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now I understand. I now understand the reason for the wave-like attitude Hasumi-senpai has shown so far, and what Takinami-senpai and Kanata-senpai meant when they both said that it was not my fault that Hasumi-senpai ran away from home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Hasumi-senpai, it was her father who she should hate, not me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she tried to talk to me as normally as possible. Sometimes she would have a moment of coldness, but if I think back, it was always when uncle appeared, or when she associated him with her memories of her mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only time she would poke at me was when I was talking to a girl, or when I brought up the subject of girls. The similarities of that with uncle made her angry.</span></p><div class="zetro-31d51445d226d04d45bea3e5d1c2a462 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-31d51445d226d04d45bea3e5d1c2a462"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And one more thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai said that this was a family matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. This was a family matter. Putting Hasumi-san aside, Hasumi-senpai does not regard me as family in the first place, and from the beginning, she had no interest in me. She should hate me? What a joke. How arrogant. The proof of this was that she never once called me by name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what should I do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do I stand by since I have no business meddling in the affairs of other people&#8217;s families?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, even if I’m an outsider, I still have a role to play in my own way. I will eventually leave the Hasumi family. But, I can’t ignore this matter. In fact, I think there were things I should do because I was leaving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, look at yourself objectively and calmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where do I stand? How should I behave now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought about it, an answer was projected into my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai should tell that to uncle. Otherwise, you’re just gonna look like you’re just throwing a tantrum.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glared at me sharply, it seemed that it hit a sore spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong with that!? He wouldn’t understand If I didn’t do so! All he cares about is you! Isn’t there anything else he should be doing!? Or what?! Dead people don’t matter at all?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai became agitated and started to ramble all at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she was not asking for attention from her father. She just wanted to say that there was something more to a dead person, her mother, as she just said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However―,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll understand this either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I meet her caustic gaze head on and quietly tell her. It was easy to agree with her here… But I can&#8217;t back down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s father… no, he’s also my father. I don&#8217;t mean to put it this way, but that man is so out of it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know what he said when he was welcoming me to his house? ‘I have a daughter who&#8217;s about your age. I think she&#8217;d make a good conversation partner.’ he said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Did he say that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may seem like I&#8217;m repeating myself, but high school girls usually don&#8217;t take kindly to the idea of a boy of the same age living together. In fact, they would probably actively protest against it. However, Hasumi-san had never even imagined such a situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uncle probably thinks we can work well together as siblings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short pause, she let out a deep sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, her body suddenly relaxes.</span></p><div class="zetro-098122619b7a27c76bf82c4dfa4a8fa1 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-098122619b7a27c76bf82c4dfa4a8fa1"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I got tired of staying in the same house, so I ran away with a bang, but I can only stay away for a week at most. And that won&#8217;t mean anything if he doesn’t understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said in an amused tone, scratching her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but will you go home with me today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. Why not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was probably going to talk to uncle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was telling me that she wants me to be there too.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was what happened after that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After we finished closing the library, Hasumi-senpai and I went home together. It was after 7:00 p.m. By then, Hasumi-san had already returned home and greeted his daughter with a look of relief when she came home for the first time after a full day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Hasumi-senpai stretched his father&#8217;s cheeks with all her might.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologize! Apologize to mom right this instant!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle seemed to understand everything at that moment, and silently turned away and moved to the front of his late wife&#8217;s Buddhist altar. There he slowly sat down on his knees and bowed deeply, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now he turned to Hasumi-senpai, who was watching the scene from the side, still sitting upright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And to you too, Shion. I apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at her father&#8217;s attitude and her eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was so focused on helping Shizuru-kun, who was left all alone, that I didn&#8217;t pay attention to you or Misato. I am sorry. Please forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Hasumi-san, who has no understanding of his daughter&#8217;s feelings, would understand if she went this far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle bowed down his head to his daughter, as he did to the altar earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, Hasumi-senpai will settle this matter here. She might be angry, slap him, he apologizes, and that will be the end of it. I hope she won’t stretch this further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe things might not return as usual. No, perhaps things will never return to the way they were, considering the mistakes Hasumi-san made. But, still, a peaceful home will come back sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai turned around without saying anything to uncle and returned to her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next is me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She mumbled.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Act 8</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on the clothes for going out that the Hasumi residence gave me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Hasumi-senpai has been interacting normally with uncle since then. Although she wasn’t showing any smile, she wasn’t being rude either. She was probably more open to her father than any other household out there. I don’t have a clue whether she was like this before as I don’t know her former self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like she cooled down since she was not getting annoyed with me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Case closed, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, then…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I changed my clothes, I shoved my smartphone and wallet into my pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I went downstairs to the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, you going somewhere?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t need to call her out, but Hasumi-senpai asked me first. She seemed to have guessed that I was going somewhere when she saw me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I was thinking of going back home for a bit.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her where I was going, she thought for a bit then gave a vague reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m off then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yeah. Careful out there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked at me with a somewhat vacant look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The train ride took only a few minutes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After exiting the Shin Nagata station and greeting the huge blue robot who protects the city &#8211; I walked a little further and saw an apartment building with an elaborately designed entrance. It was my home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I unlocked the door and went inside, I found that the room was sweltering hot, as it had been closed all summer in early summer. I immediately thought about turning on the air conditioner, but decided to ventilate the air first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After opening the window leading to the balcony, I now turned my attention to my mother&#8217;s altar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before going to the Hasumi residence, I had emptied the tokkuri, mizutama, and white plate, so I put sake, water, washed rice, and salt in each of them as offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m home, Mom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the Shinto rite, two bow, two clap, and one bow were made towards the altar. However, since the 50th day festival had not yet been held, I did not make a sound when I joined my hands. After following the instructions given to me by the priest at the wake and burial site ceremonies, I finally greeted my mother as I was back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once that was done, I closed the windows again and turned on the air conditioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around the living room and kitchen and deliberately let out a sound, but the truth was, I didn&#8217;t come home with something to do. No, there was something to do, but if it doesn&#8217;t go as planned, it will all be for naught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I picked up the remote control from the low table and turned on the TV as soon as I sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The news broke. Apparently, a thirty year old son had murdered his sixty year old mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, you don’t have to kill your parents, they will die sooner or later. There is only a difference between early and late death.”</span></p><div class="zetro-1e9eed1ef01018d5543a76cd9bd277a7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1e9eed1ef01018d5543a76cd9bd277a7"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I heard the news, such words came flowing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because of the uninspiring news or was it because of what I said? I was disgusted by something and immediately turned off the TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I stood up again, even though I had just sat down, and threw open the door to my mom&#8217;s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mom&#8217;s room was simple. There was a bed, drawers, a stack of books filled with nursing books, and a writing desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to what my mom told me, nurses were not only in charge of patients in hospitals. They have to keep up to date with the latest knowledge and do nursing research. Was she studying in her room after coming home late?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at mom’s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I leave the Hasumi residence and become a nuisance at my grandparents&#8217; place, I will have to lighten my load as much as possible. In other words, this house and my mother&#8217;s room would need to be cleaned out completely. I made a rough sketch in my mind of what to throw away and what to keep, and sorted them into folders in my mind. The ones I couldn&#8217;t decide on, I decided to put on hold, depending on whether my grandparents would want them or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that time while I was preparing to clean up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">C**p, I thought, and by the time I realized it, it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears streamed from my eyes and down my cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I instinctively realized that the owner of this room was no longer here. My mother, who had lived with me for the past seventeen years of my life, had passed away, and now all I have left of her were her remains and her portrait. Her things will gradually be disposed of. The life I took for granted until half a month ago will never return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wandered back into the living room and collapsed onto the sofa. I covered my eyes with the back of my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did I and mom have to go through this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Human life was more fragile than you can imagine. Mom and I lived a peaceful life together, but one day, just because she was unlucky enough to be there, she lost her life, and I was inexcusably deprived of the only family I had left. I don&#8217;t know how old I will live, but my mother will be gone for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the door chime rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dammit…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a squeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">F**k.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know who to expect. It was her. She was the one who had come to settle the score. But I couldn&#8217;t see her in this state. Should I just ignore it? But if I did so, she might miss the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was having trouble thinking, the front door opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? It’s unlocked… What, you’re here after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai who went in, just as I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a nice apartment, but it was basically for a compact household, such as a single person or a household with no children. Because of its uncomplicated structure, the living room can be seen from the entrance. Hasumi-senpai seemed to recognize me right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, are you alright? Do you feel unwell?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me still collapsed on the sofa, she shouts in a panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then what’s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice came from nearby. She must have come up to the front door and was looking down at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a really terrible time to appear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I remembered… my mom…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-c2c7be7c2c433149d1cfdf61e9cfe635 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c2c7be7c2c433149d1cfdf61e9cfe635"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahー&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked awkward and she let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Towels, where are they?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There are some in the bathroom.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then headed that way without saying a word. After a while, a towel fell softly on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look awful.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked her for getting me a towel, and this time I covered my face with it instead of my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did Hasumi-senpai want me to wipe my face with it? Or did she bring it to me as something to hide my face? Either way, I was thankful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I came at an awkward time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I didn&#8217;t expect this either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I showed a very disgraceful sight to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai seemed to have settled down on the other sofa. I could hear the squeaking of the springs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I was like that before. When it sunk down to me that Mom died.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai narrates her story while faltering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Granted, you probably had it harder than me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still had her father. But in my case, I was alone with my mother, so I would be left alone without her. Although I have someone I can call my father, he only came forward like yesterday. I feel bad for him, but I don&#8217;t really feel that at the moment. I don&#8217;t know if I will be able to recognize him in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is coming from experience―be prepared. It’ll be back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stating her stance, Hasumi-senpai stroked my head, scratching up my bangs. She stroked it again and again, gently and carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a nasty prediction. However, it must be true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Mom and I were both of a certain age and she had lived out her natural life, I might have been able to make a more reasonable judgment. But unfortunately, Mom died too young, her life was taken away for no reason. And I was probably still too young to accept that fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In retrospect, it was probably a good thing that I went to the Hasumi residence and led a completely different life than I had before. If I had stayed in this house, I would have been forced to accept the fact that mom had died and I was left on my own, and I would have felt even more depressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much time had passed? Perhaps it was because I was observing the environment, or perhaps it was because I was touched by Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s actions, but my mood gradually calmed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up with my pathetic face half covered by a towel. Hasumi-senpai didn’t say anything. She just withdrew her hand. I went to the washroom, washed my face, and threw the towel into the laundry basket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking one deep breath, I returned to the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you calmed down?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was wearing blue skinny pants and a white T-shirt with a print on it. There was a cap on the low table, so she was probably also wearing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I made you see a pathetic sight.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to worry about it… more than that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-47808e052daecce7b300a91aafd5b4b9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-47808e052daecce7b300a91aafd5b4b9"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she glanced at Mom&#8217;s altar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your mother?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been on her mind ever since she came here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I pay respect?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please do so. I’m sure Mom would be pleased too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head and wondered if she really would be, even though I said so myself. I guess it must feel weird if the daughter of a man you once had a relationship with, that you couldn’t openly share with others, pay respect to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, unlike me, Hasumi-senpai didn’t think about such things. She sat upright in front of Mom&#8217;s altar, put her hands together, and prayed silently. Her actions were more appropriate than me, who was thinking about what happened when she was alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Hasumi-senpai finished her silent prayer, she looked straight at Mom&#8217;s remains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She looks beautiful.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe this isn’t something a son should say but―I agree.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why are your looks above average? You should have more filial piety.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She instantly turned her reproachful voice towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry but there’s a limit to how much I could try. I’m sorry I couldn’t live up to your expectations. I’ll make some tea right away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the kitchen and took out from the refrigerator a plastic bottle of oolong tea that I had bought on my way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I prepared two glasses and poured them into each. There was some ice, but it has been sitting in the freezer for two weeks. I don&#8217;t think it has gone bad, but I don&#8217;t feel comfortable using it, so I decided not to use it. Thanks to this, the tea oozed a sense of hospitality of being unaccustomed to dealing with visitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed silly to show off now, so I returned to the living room with one of them in each hand. I put one of them in front of Hasumi-senpai, who was sitting on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks. I’ll take it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then quickly brought the glass to her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you come here just to visit my mom?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there’s that too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cut me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">”Um,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she was hesitant about her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited for her to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, having made up her mind, spoke up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bowed her head lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About what?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;About the other morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-41db664be94f19be31cd09af62104ec2 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-41db664be94f19be31cd09af62104ec2"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhhh.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sound, understanding her point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, about the heartless words she spat at me the other morning. Of course, I knew that was the case from the beginning. But if I didn&#8217;t pretend not to understand, it would be revealed that I was waiting for Hasumi-senpai to apologize and that I came back to this house for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind, really. You had a lot on your plate at that time and were on the verge of exploding, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s true, but still, there are things that are right to say and things that are wrong to say. That’s why, I’m sorry. I was actually trying to be sarcastic regarding Dad, but it ended up hurting you too in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was satisfied with her words of repentance. I knew I wasn’t wrong about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up from the sofa, turned my back to Hasumi-senpai, and headed for the kitchen. There, I took something out from one of the cupboards. It was…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch box.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words I uttered must have been abrupt and irrelevant for Hasumi-senpai. That was why she tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason I came back here today was also to get this. You&#8217;re going to make me some… right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. We had that agreement.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I showed it to her, Hasumi-senpai wryly smiled.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll make you lunch, but I won&#8217;t provide a lunch box. Bring the one you have been using. That&#8217;s the deal.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s only until summer vacation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until summer vacation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still not understanding the meaning of my words, Hasumi-senpai asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I’m planning to leave Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s house when summer vacation arrives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her directly this time, she let out a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She showed a look of surprise. However, when her face eventually became somewhat clear, Hasumi-senpai calmly spun her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. Maybe that’s a good idea.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. That was the best way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I learned that Hasumi-senpai doesn’t hate me because of the incident the other day, and the Hasumi family, which had a crack in it, was beginning to show signs of repair, or even a new start of a father-daughter relationship. However, even so, it was definitely not right for me to be there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the lunch box on the dining room table and returned to the living room. I saw Hasumi-senpai thinking about something and sipping a glass of tea with a movement that was at odds with her intention. She poured some tea down her throat and slowly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know how to say this, but there&#8217;s something distorted about you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just like right now, you look so calm even though it’s your problem. It seems to me that you’re always acting in a &#8216;should&#8217; way, and I can’t see what you even want to do. It’s as if you’re suppressing yourself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai cut her words off.</span></p><div class="zetro-41ccb9baff384ad7bd8d4485e7532e27 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-41ccb9baff384ad7bd8d4485e7532e27"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I were in your shoes, I’d…it’s scary.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Scary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but repeat her words, which were so unlike Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Scary.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m afraid of being left alone in a house I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m afraid of leaving that house again after settling down. I don&#8217;t think I could ever do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai laughed and I fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t intend to kill my own feelings. It was just that when I looked for the best solution, the element Makabe Shizuru was on a par with other elements. It was only natural. It was the same with equations. If you treat a particular value with bias, you will not get an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was doing this with that intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, I had a “reason” to be able to do so or rather a “lack” of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how much of my feelings were spontaneous and how much of them were created.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became too good at reading the atmosphere, looking at myself objectively, and finding the best solution for how I should act and what kind of facial expression I should make. ―This was the result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, I certainly have a favorable impression of Takinami Ruika. But was it really my own feeling? Was it possible that I was only trying to think that way because she wants me to? As long as I don&#8217;t know that, I shouldn&#8217;t respond to her feelings lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, Mibu Kanata said, ‘If things were to be resolved, you would willingly choose to be stoned.’ That was true. In the past, I have actually chosen to do so. As long as I can&#8217;t wipe out the possibility that my own feelings were false, I&#8217;m not inclined to give them any importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was what I “lack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s point that I seemed to be suppressing myself was probably correct, and I am aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably didn&#8217;t mean to accuse me of being crazy, she was simply jokingly saying what she thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for some reason, Hasumi Shion&#8217;s words stuck in my mind.</span></p>
