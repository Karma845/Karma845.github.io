<h3 style= "text-align: center;">Chapter 4 - Lastly, Creating Memories: Act 1</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in the kitchen watching Hasumi-senpai packing my lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geeー! Why is it so big?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it a little more precisely, it was Hasumi-senpai agonizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why, you ask? It was because my lunch box was bigger than she expected and she was struggling to fill it in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think mine is particularly big. This is just how it is for a high school boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed she didn&#8217;t care much about other people&#8217;s lunches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dad’s was just a size bigger than mine, I wonder if that’s enough.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Hasumi&#8217;s lunch box. It was small, a perfect size for a girl. Her dad’s lunch box has already been taken away and was not here, but if his was about one size larger than this one, then the size would be somewhere between mine and Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It depends on how much he eats, but it&#8217;s probably on the lower side for an adult male.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai wrinkles her brow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I was in eighth grade, my mother was hospitalized. I cooked for us, but I never had any experience cooking prior to that. I guess that&#8217;s why Dad couldn&#8217;t complain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been hard to complain or even give an order to his daughter who was trying so hard in her mother&#8217;s place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll buy a new one next time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure Uncle would appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My 33ks relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, Hasumi-senpai seemed to have forgiven Uncle. Otherwise, she wouldn&#8217;t have bothered to think about buying a new lunch box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, I think I’d like to add one more dish.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai then looked inside the freezer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine with anything.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way I’m making such a hollow lunch box.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She returned with her back to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was she going to cut corners now, or was she going to continue being stubborn? It seemed that she really wanted to fill my lunch box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s only for the rest of the semester, so you do you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to tell me, I’ll do it anyway. Alright, looks good.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took out frozen dumplings. She intended to stuff it into the remaining gap. Hasumi-senpai took two of them out of the bag and threw them into the microwave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She called out to me as she gazed into the glowing interior of the microwave as it began to heat up.</span></p><div class="zetro-ab45c12bb1a2b2c41c71e48c56062307 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ab45c12bb1a2b2c41c71e48c56062307"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, you were going to leave when summer vacation arrived.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the plan.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there wasn’t any change to the plan, I could only answer yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think Hasumi-senpai was asking me to reconsider. Was it just a banter to bridge the gap, or was she trying to somehow understand my incomprehensible choice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That being said, it won’t be right away. We decided to hold my mother’s 50th(death) day here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realized that when someone dies, it was always busy. After my mother&#8217;s series of funerals, I was immediately asked about the 50th day anniversary of her death. I was forced to make a decision in about 10 days, because I had to ask the convenience of a Shinto priest and hold the funeral hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, we decided to ask the same funeral company to hold the service at the same place for now. Well, it was a common choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you told Dad yet that you&#8217;re leaving?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I plan to talk to him after the final exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should tell him earlier… Well, Dad might be disappointed, but it sounds like he promised to let you do whatever you want in the first place, so he probably won&#8217;t hold you back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, Hasumi-senpai was right. The reason I was here right now was because it was a trial period, so to speak. If I like it, I can stay, if not, I can choose another option. That was the agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, knowing Dad, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll give you all the help he can, no matter where you go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the microwave oven played a light melody. Apparently it had finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai turned at the sound and put her hand on the handle &#8211; and then she suddenly realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean it in a weird way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weird way…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I wondered what she was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I soon realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, she was trying to say that she was not being sarcastic as she was the other morning. It seems that Hasumi-senpai was still hung up on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand, I know that you’re not that kind of a person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Somehow, the way you said it pisses me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she was embarrassed by the answer that affirmed her humanity, Hasumi-senpai took her anger out on me in a truly irrational manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, while avoiding looking at me, she took the dumplings out of the microwave and carefully transferred them one by one into the lunch box with chopsticks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, it&#8217;s ready. Close the lid and take it with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need to close the lid myself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, perhaps it was just for today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to put the lid on my lunch box as I was told &#8211; at that moment my hand stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Did you find something you didn&#8217;t like?”</span></p><div class="zetro-6fd7107c0aa72201fd560c971ca84a5e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6fd7107c0aa72201fd560c971ca84a5e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s just I never thought I’d use this lunchbox again…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom used to make my lunch. It was just me and my mother, so it was only natural. Even in a family where both parents were present, a mother would probably make the lunches, unless the father was an avid cook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after Mom passed away, this lunch box was never used. If I had been a girl, I might have made it myself like Hasumi-senpai did, but I didn&#8217;t think the result would be worth the effort, so I decided to eat at the school cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re fine with this, I&#8217;ll make you some as much as you want. But unfortunately, we only have until summer vacation. Also, I can&#8217;t beat your mother no matter how much I try, so don&#8217;t compare us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t be so tactless. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked Hasumi-senpai for her bluntness and put the lid on my lunch box.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Makabe. Let&#8217;s go to the cafeteria!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi invited me out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was the one calling out to him, but recently, he started calling me out like it was natural. I appreciate it, but unfortunately, there was a reason why I couldn&#8217;t go to the cafeteria today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. I have packed lunch today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied, he was already at the doorway of the classroom with an indescribable look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go on ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi told his friends that were waiting and came over to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We haven&#8217;t been eating together much lately, is it because I told you to come over </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">here</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi looked somewhat apologetic. I guess he thought I was trying to distance myself from him because of what he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That has nothing to do with it. I told you I brought a packed lunch, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I played with the bag that had my lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am. What? Wanna see it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s good. If that’s the case… It’s fine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although he had some doubts, he was somewhat convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyouhei-kun, don’t mind him. Listen to what the person is saying, just leave him alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was one of the group members who had been watching from a little distance. He sounded hostile and irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Watch your tone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Naoi scolded him, he snorted and disappeared down the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry about that, Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi smiled bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forget about me inviting you over. You have your own place. But let&#8217;s eat together again. Call me at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi then followed his friends out, looking as fresh as ever until the moment he left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deliberately let out a sound and looked around the classroom. I soon found what I was looking for. I saw Karube had a bag on his hand and headed to Heshikiri-san to have lunch with her. The three of us ate together, a custom that had continued from last year until recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s been a while since I’ve had lunch with them.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my own lunch box and went over to the two of them.</span></p><div class="zetro-6f95917f16e3930b226b0b384862b81a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6f95917f16e3930b226b0b384862b81a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The usual arrangement was that Karube sits sideways in the seat in front of Heshikiri-san, and I sit next to him, diagonally from Heshikiri-san&#8217;s point of view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi seem to like Makabe, but the others don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I sat down at the table, Karube suddenly started speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re afraid that</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> with Naoi being interested in you, you might join the group</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, it’s not good to say things like that out loud.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I tend to analyze situations and people&#8217;s behavior, I can&#8217;t speak for others, but I don&#8217;t say it out loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Karube was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I mentioned before, the leader, Naoi Kyouhei, has the generosity to accept anyone. He didn’t set up walls that enclose his group for others to join in. However, that was not the case for his group. They were truly exclusive, that Naoi Kyouhei’s friends were only them. They have this kind of selective thinking that only they can rule at the top of the school caste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, I was not pleased that Naoi thought great of me, nor did I have the slightest desire to increase the number of my friends. I was on good terms with Naoi, but there were also others, such as the man I just mentioned, who was outright being hostile to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, I had no intention of joining Naoi&#8217;s group, so their concern was unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That story aside &#8211; I took my lunch box out of the bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Doesn&#8217;t look like a bought lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, Karube sarcastically said, &#8220;His lunch was a sandwich he bought in the morning at the convenience store.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a lunch box made by my beloved sister, Hasumi-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Naoi really wanted to see it, it could have been bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the lid and turned my body towards Karube, holding the lunch box in my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad you guys are getting along so well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know about that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai told me that she doesn’t hate me and that I’m innocent because I was just born. However, whether or not she would accept me as family was another matter. This morning, she made me lunch and we had a casual talk, but I think it was more about the bond of living under one roof and her sympathy for the loss of my mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Heshikiri-san. It’s been a while since you wore those glasses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ye-yeah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensing that my unintentional comment was about to darken the mood, I turned to Heshikiri-san to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has more than one pair of glasses and seemed to change them depending on her mood. I had never seen her wearing the same one two days in a row. The girl who wears glasses like it was an accessory, as I told Hasumi-senpai before, was Heshikiri-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she doesn’t seem to be the adventurous type, all of them were a classic, standard Wellington-type. The only difference was the color and the thickness of the frames. Even so, Karube was the first to notice, followed by me. I wonder how many people noticed it, since she was not exactly in the limelight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Karube, how many days has it been?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven&#8217;t seen it since last Wednesday, so it&#8217;s been five days.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karibe easily answered, as if he was describing what he had eaten last night, but he had this look of disinterest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gee, you don’t have to remember that kind of thing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a good memory, you see.”</span></p><div class="zetro-83cccf420f64d4611ab74d3195eac8d5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-83cccf420f64d4611ab74d3195eac8d5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube said casually as he put the sandwich in his mouth. Heshikiri-san looks at him reproachfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as for me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you laughing at?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s nothing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asked by Karube, I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I was laughing. Partly because the exchange between Karube and Heshikiri was amusing. But from a larger perspective, I think this atmosphere was probably to my liking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until last week, I had been eating with Naoi&#8217;s group. With my nature being what it was, I can get along reasonably well with them, but if anything, I prefer to stay in a quiet corner of the classroom with these two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was thanks to Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s help in making my lunch box, and I guess it means that I have regained a part of my daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karibe seemed to have lost interest in my deceptive answer and said nothing more. On the other hand, Heshikiri looked like she wanted to say something, but as with Karube, she said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, while shifting the topic to something else, Karube ate the two sandwiches he had bought at the convenience store, then I finished the lunch box made by Hasumi-senpai, and finally Heshikiri-san finished her own lunch box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, by the way. Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san then took out a book in place of the lunch box she had tucked away into her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takahashi Kazumi, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Waga Kaitai </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(わが解体). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[T/N I looked online for his books but I can’t find any translation of this book, I can’t do it justice so I’ll just leave it as Romaji, but if you want a rough translation it would be (My Deconstruction)]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really a plain hobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book looked very old. Probably not recent, it looked to be brought shortly after its publication. And if you look closely, you can see a barcode with our school&#8217;s name on it. It seemed to have been borrowed from the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since I was the only member of the library committee, I must have been the one who checked out the books. However, I try not to pay attention to the titles of books when I check them out, so it was only natural that I don&#8217;t remember them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san opened up a page of the book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all and good but,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heshikiri-san, please don’t use sticky notes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Oh, yeah. I&#8217;ll be careful when I peel it off.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pointed this out to her, she replied with words that sounded like excuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it bad? I also do that a lot.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Karube said from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sticky notes are surprisingly hard to remove, it might tear the page. Especially the ones that have strong adhesive. And if the book is old, like this one, the pages have deteriorated so much that just trying to peel off a regular sticky note will tear it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a student returned a book with a sticky note on it, I basically have them remove it themselves. I can&#8217;t tell you how many students accidentally tear the pages off when they’re in a hurry to remove it. Thanks to this, I started doing it myself recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if it was Heshikiri-san who loves books, it would probably be fine. On the contrary, Shiiba-senpai would most likely be the one to mess up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too, Karube, be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to it until now. I&#8217;ll keep it in mind. Well, I don’t have to worry about that when it comes to my own books, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, treat it with care.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-9a4f7e4fd9f83b69d46e4b4646be291d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9a4f7e4fd9f83b69d46e4b4646be291d"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san faced Karube with a sullen face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heard that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright. I’ll be careful with any books.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if he was taking an oath, Karube raised his hand and said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Henshikiri-san, what&#8217;s up with that book?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The book was handed to me, still open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Delusional Weirdo Horn Dog.” [T/N I tried.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blank space on that page had that written.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how to read it correctly, but it must be an insult, perhaps a pun on a person&#8217;s name. As for the meaning, well, I can guess. Whatever the case may be, both the person who wrote it and the name who was written were probably not a decent human being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did they write it in pencil?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried rubbing it with an eraser, but it wouldn&#8217;t go away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pen, huh? Alright, I’ll try to sand it off later.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it disappears, great. If it doesn&#8217;t disappear, well…I’ll just pretend that I didn’t notice it and put it back on the shelf. Besides, I don’t even know if this book would get borrowed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned the book back to Heshikiri-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, Karube. Let’s go get some coffee.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both stand up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heshikiri.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karibe called Heshikiri-san’s name. He was probably asking if she wanted to go with us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m good. I have this after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She showed her water bottle as she declined the offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi Shion who let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube and I went to the vending machine in the corner of the cafeteria, where we ran into Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group. She had brought her own lunch, so she must have come here to buy something to drink after lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was standing still, perhaps not expecting to see me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi&#8217;s group would have been very excited and would strike up a conversation, but that was not the case with me and Karube. Karube Kagemitsu was a constant person who was always on the edge of his seat at all times, and while I was good at keeping the conversation going, I was definitely not a person who gets excited over trivial matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring them… would probably be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, if it isn’t Librarian-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking, I was interrupted at the right moment. It was Shiiba-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Shiiba-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, afternoon. Hey, listen, listen. I&#8217;m reading that book.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai looked up at me with a gesture reminiscent of a puppy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected of a library committee, it was certainly easy to read.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, my first recommendation got thrown off the window though.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wah, Shion-chan, look, Librarian-kun is being mean to me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai clung to Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get me involved. Besides, isn’t it a fact that you can’t read it so you got recommended to another book?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gununu… Don’t I have any allies…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it looked like that was enough fooling around, since her expression suddenly turned bright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me know if you find any good books, alright?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand… then, see you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I safely passed Hasumi-senpai and went to the side of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out a hundred yen coin and a ten yen coin from my wallet and was about to buy a café au lait from the vending machine―,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached for the slot to slide my money in, but suddenly my hand was grabbed. Two coins fell from my hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, hey…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai pulled me by the hand and took me away. The coins I dropped were still scattered on the floor… Well, I&#8217;m sure Karube, who was looking away with a blank expression on his face, will pick them up. Knowing him, he’ll probably buy me a café au lait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken to the side of the cafeteria doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cafeteria was at the end of the school building. In other words, we were at the end of the hallway. The students coming in and out of the cafeteria were wondering what we were talking about, but they couldn&#8217;t stop and walked past us, looking at us from a sideways glance.</span></p><div class="zetro-64ea777b4998de0172b285844a675dcd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-64ea777b4998de0172b285844a675dcd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai had a difficult look on her face, as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I would like you to think that our meeting here was just an accident.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will do my best to avoid seeing her at school, but I would be glad if she allowed me to bump into her in places like this where all students have access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care about any of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so it’s fine?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what was that face that seemed to be angry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevermind that,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded to her words, after which I thought she was about to cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch, how was it…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, what came out of her mouth was something unexpected, and this time, I made a dumb sound without realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, it was plain delicious, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Hasumi-senpai looked doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean most of it was just frozen food…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I made the other half, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she got angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just a tamagoyaki, but if it doesn&#8217;t suit your taste, what&#8217;s the point?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll put up with it even if it&#8217;s not to my liking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d rather have you tell me what you want rather than putting up with it. Come on, spit it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, even if it was more work she’ll do it, and if she made something, she wanted to make something that satisfies the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s just me saying that I’m simply grateful that you made me some, so I will not complain, and as I said at the beginning, it was delicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? Then, good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stated my impressions, Hasumi-senpai returned to her usual blunt attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was her boyfriend, a boy she liked, or someone she wanted to say how good it tasted, she would probably be pleased, but for someone like me, it seemed that she would only feel &#8220;If there’s no problem, then good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I wasn&#8217;t worried about anything, since the food we eat at home was delicious to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo-you don&#8217;t have to answer questions I didn&#8217;t ask.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slapped me on the arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s face was red. Is it possible that she was embarrassed? She becomes embarrassed when you like it and praise her, even though she was concerned about whether it suits my palate or not. What a difficult person.</span></p><div class="zetro-9b7782fb90e6ba7969f98214c5e2bdf5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9b7782fb90e6ba7969f98214c5e2bdf5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, we&#8217;re going back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her feet away as if she was running away, and I followed Hasumi-senpai as she headed back toward the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it. You two seem to be close. A date perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Akane Shiiba-senpai. She was grinning wickedly, probably amused by the fact that the two of us were secretly talking in private.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Also, do we look like we get along?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You do, you do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai nodded her head repeatedly, looking to be enjoying herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, Hasumi-senpai turned and looked at me. She didn’t say anything, but her eyes were asking my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only tilt my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Librarian-kun, Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai called out to me and pulled me closer to her as she put her arm around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll leave it at that, so you tell me how Shion-chan looked on your date later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akane, stop being silly and let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since they were only a few steps apart, Hasumi-senpai could hear her, and perhaps Shiiba-senpai said it so that she could let her hear on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stuck out her tongue and quickly backed away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group then left, and I saw them off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, something was offered to me from the side of my view. It was a can of coffee, and the hand holding it belonged to Karube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the usual one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Karube. He was very thoughtful. He had already bought my usual coffee with low sugar content and opened the pull-tab while he was waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to drink it right away.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the library after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Makabe-kun. Today I heard you and Hasumi-san had a difficult look on your faces while talking. Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, later when there were fewer people around, Takinami Ruika appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, the matter at lunch? No, she was just asking if the lunch she prepared suited my tastes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the location, a good number of students passed by while Hasumi-senpai and I were talking, so Takinami-senpai must have caught wind of it. She must have been genuinely concerned because she knew about our complicated relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Hasumi-senpai made some for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lowered my voice because of the content of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Takinami-senpai suddenly looked as if she ate something bitter and turned her face downwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could I forget such methods?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this fine? Takinami Ruika, the object of admiration of many boys at our Akendai High School, was making a face that she shouldn’t make in public.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I met her a few times in the cafeteria, but I was so careless. If I had made some from the beginning, Shizuru might have been mine by now…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was really eager to fish me with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Even if you did, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to bring it to me, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can just paint a picture, like the library committee member who has been helping me so much is having a hard time because of the loss of her mother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like she was going to take advantage of anything that seems viable. Well, it has been that way since a long time ago, it was too late to say anything now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if Hasumi-san knows that I’m aiming for Shizuru, and if I did tell her, will she give me her position?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she used the word &#8220;aim&#8221; with a smile, her intention</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of making me a lunchbox sounds like a predator&#8217;s scheme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Takinami-san, good afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon to you too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A female student entered the room and greeted Takinami Ruika as soon as she saw her. Takihana turned around and returned with a friendly, mature smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that’s right. This isn’t the time to be chatting around… Makabe-kun, can I have your help to find a book?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps remembering that this was the library and that many students were still coming and going at this time, she turned her smile to me across the counter. What a quick turn of attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, what kind of book is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Thank you. That’ll help.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really a textbook conversation between an honor student and a library committee member. However, Takinami-senpai had a secret side to her, and I have an appropriate attitude toward her with each side of her. Considering this, it was really a very outward and blatant exchange of words.</span></p><div class="zetro-29920dfcc554f0fba7ee74bfd87c3823 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-29920dfcc554f0fba7ee74bfd87c3823"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t hate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m looking for a French translation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Tale of Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… Do we have it in our library by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Tale of Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in French? Is there such a thing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think we have that on the shelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tap the terminal on the counter in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Le Dit Du Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Is this it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I searched for it with doubt, and found something that really looked like it. I was surprised that it really existed, but I was also surprised that this library had them. I don&#8217;t know how to read it in French, so I read the alphabet as it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You found it? Let me see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that with a pleased expression, Takinami-senpai leaned forward on the counter and peeked at the terminal screen. She doesn&#8217;t have to do that because there was a rotating platform under the monitor to show the screen to users as well, but… I’m sure she was doing it on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the terminal, trying not to look at her. It seemed to be in a case with a booklet in three parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you read French?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. I can barely read English and classic literature.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Says who? You were named as a top achiever in both subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard from someone that the book was beautifully illustrated, so I wanted to take a look at it. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, still leaning forward against the counter, turned her head toward me from the screen and happily smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was close, so it was hard not to look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll go get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up and went to the shelves to escape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pre-bell rang at 5:55 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was five minutes before closing time, and there were only so many students left that I could count them with one hand. One of them was Kanata-senpai, who was sitting in her usual seat and running a pen on her notebook, and the other was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was looking at the French translation of &#8220;The Tale of Genji&#8221; that I had brought with me, sitting far away from Kanata-senpai. But when the remaining students left the room, leaving just her and Kanata-senpai, she stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, thanks for the book. I’m done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came over here, she put the book on the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to borrow it? You seemed to have read it with enthusiasm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I could get your attention by pretending to be a literary girl at first, but halfway through the book, I started to dwindle. The illustrations were beautiful though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai casually said something calculating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, maybe it was the fact that she can&#8217;t be so calculating when she goes out of her way to say it. It would be scary if it was a part of her calculation to make me think that way…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like it&#8217;s a shame that I can&#8217;t read. Maybe I’ll study French when I go to college.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds great.”</span></p><div class="zetro-05414f201982e2e1dabfab1e22489ddd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-05414f201982e2e1dabfab1e22489ddd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the book and put it on the book truck of returned books at the counter. I&#8217;ll put it back on the shelf tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru. How about something like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned back to her, Takinami-senpai was again leaning forward against the counter, propping herself up on both elbows and resting her chin on her crossed hands. She then sent a provocative look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Curious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pose was also provocative. She unbuttoned one of the buttons of her blouse after all. Although the blouse was Japanese in style, so there was no cleavage to be seen, it was natural for a man to be curious about what was under her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now there&#8217;s no one around, so don&#8217;t be shy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, her dialogue was also provocative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this was the second time. When I searched for a book earlier, she did the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop being stupid. Please go home, it’s already time for closing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it was not that we were the only ones left. Don&#8217;t forget that Kanata-senpai was also present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept my distance from her, although any other guy would have his eyeballs moving around at a sickeningly high speed. I rested my body on the back of the chair, and as a member of the library committee, I asked her to leave the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai seemed somewhat dissatisfied with my attitude, and when she sat down, she put her hands on her hips in a sulky manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what, Shizuru? I&#8217;m putting my dignity as a woman on the line here, so don&#8217;t you think you should respect it by displaying a reaction?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you put your dignity as a woman on the line, you are responsible for your own failure and success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want to be demanded an opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru is used to seeing women&#8217;s bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then a voice breaks in. Of course, it belongs to Mibu Kanata, the last student left besides us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, Kanata-senpai, who was getting ready to leave, came up to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Mibu-san!? Shi-Shizu…what do you mean used to?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed there were so many surprises and can’t be unheard words that she jammed her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked at Kanata-senpai reflexively, but stared at me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by… No way, Hasumi-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did it come to that? Well, the only female who was involved in my personal life was Hasumi-senpai, so I guess it was a natural association. In fact, I was gradually becoming accustomed to seeing her in her usual revealing attire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily flinched at Takinami-senpai’s presence who suddenly came up to me leaning over the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I suddenly realized. ―Why was I being so stupidly honest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute. That&#8217;s got to be just her joke.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Joke…?”</span></p><div class="zetro-2ae8f89a81241e134f25bd5e5f5db379 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2ae8f89a81241e134f25bd5e5f5db379"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Senpai looked puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn’t I think of that possibility first? It was obvious at first glance that I was just a simple library committee with no relation to women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, however,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai replied. She shrugged her shoulders with a smile that was truly meaningful. My mouth unintentionally leaked out a voice saying, &#8220;Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you ask Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she answered, Takinami-senpai turned to me once again. The way she turned her head was a bit horrifying. Then she moved her face closer to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru? Are you hiding something from me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are a million things I haven&#8217;t told you, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like for example?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she asked with a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m actually meeting a girl who’s about ten years old from time to time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, I didn’t know that. Introduce me next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still had a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have one, too. Like my three sizes I measured recently. Should I mention it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are we doing? Saying silly things and facing each other at a distance where our foreheads would touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. It&#8217;s no use telling people when they don&#8217;t want to know, and it&#8217;s no fun telling them when they do want to know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you don&#8217;t want to tell me, why don&#8217;t you just say so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not asking about what you were not saying, but what you are hiding. I have a feeling that you’re hiding something important, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not telling, huh? Say, why did you go silent?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked away as I kept quiet and saw Kanata-senpai was just about to leave through the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Kanata-senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this what they call a bloodbath? I witnessed something great. Anyway, goodbye you two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to stop her, but Kanata-senpai was a very easy-going person. She just lit the fire and went home. This was the work of an arsonist, indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi Shion who let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube and I went to the vending machine in the corner of the cafeteria, where we ran into Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group. She had brought her own lunch, so she must have come here to buy something to drink after lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was standing still, perhaps not expecting to see me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi&#8217;s group would have been very excited and would strike up a conversation, but that was not the case with me and Karube. Karube Kagemitsu was a constant person who was always on the edge of his seat at all times, and while I was good at keeping the conversation going, I was definitely not a person who gets excited over trivial matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring them… would probably be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, if it isn’t Librarian-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking, I was interrupted at the right moment. It was Shiiba-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Shiiba-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, afternoon. Hey, listen, listen. I&#8217;m reading that book.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai looked up at me with a gesture reminiscent of a puppy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected of a library committee, it was certainly easy to read.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, my first recommendation got thrown off the window though.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wah, Shion-chan, look, Librarian-kun is being mean to me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai clung to Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get me involved. Besides, isn’t it a fact that you can’t read it so you got recommended to another book?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gununu… Don’t I have any allies…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But, it looked like that was enough fooling around, since her expression suddenly turned bright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me know if you find any good books, alright?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand… then, see you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I safely passed Hasumi-senpai and went to the side of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out a hundred yen coin and a ten yen coin from my wallet and was about to buy a café au lait from the vending machine―,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reached for the slot to slide my money in, but suddenly my hand was grabbed. Two coins fell from my hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, hey…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai pulled me by the hand and took me away. The coins I dropped were still scattered on the floor… Well, I&#8217;m sure Karube, who was looking away with a blank expression on his face, will pick them up. Knowing him, he’ll probably buy me a café au lait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken to the side of the cafeteria doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cafeteria was at the end of the school building. In other words, we were at the end of the hallway. The students coming in and out of the cafeteria were wondering what we were talking about, but they couldn&#8217;t stop and walked past us, looking at us from a sideways glance.</span></p><div class="zetro-8833356cad98504ed40576e5571cdd58 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8833356cad98504ed40576e5571cdd58"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai had a difficult look on her face, as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I would like you to think that our meeting here was just an accident.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will do my best to avoid seeing her at school, but I would be glad if she allowed me to bump into her in places like this where all students have access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care about any of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, so it’s fine?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what was that face that seemed to be angry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevermind that,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded to her words, after which I thought she was about to cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch, how was it…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, what came out of her mouth was something unexpected, and this time, I made a dumb sound without realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, it was plain delicious, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Hasumi-senpai looked doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean most of it was just frozen food…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I made the other half, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she got angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just a tamagoyaki, but if it doesn&#8217;t suit your taste, what&#8217;s the point?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll put up with it even if it&#8217;s not to my liking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d rather have you tell me what you want rather than putting up with it. Come on, spit it out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, even if it was more work she’ll do it, and if she made something, she wanted to make something that satisfies the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s just me saying that I’m simply grateful that you made me some, so I will not complain, and as I said at the beginning, it was delicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? Then, good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stated my impressions, Hasumi-senpai returned to her usual blunt attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was her boyfriend, a boy she liked, or someone she wanted to say how good it tasted, she would probably be pleased, but for someone like me, it seemed that she would only feel &#8220;If there’s no problem, then good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I wasn&#8217;t worried about anything, since the food we eat at home was delicious to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo-you don&#8217;t have to answer questions I didn&#8217;t ask.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slapped me on the arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s face was red. Is it possible that she was embarrassed? She becomes embarrassed when you like it and praise her, even though she was concerned about whether it suits my palate or not. What a difficult person.</span></p><div class="zetro-299429f20eb71e4a627c2b80f4f69e58 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-299429f20eb71e4a627c2b80f4f69e58"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, we&#8217;re going back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her feet away as if she was running away, and I followed Hasumi-senpai as she headed back toward the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it. You two seem to be close. A date perhaps?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Akane Shiiba-senpai. She was grinning wickedly, probably amused by the fact that the two of us were secretly talking in private.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. Also, do we look like we get along?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You do, you do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai nodded her head repeatedly, looking to be enjoying herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, Hasumi-senpai turned and looked at me. She didn’t say anything, but her eyes were asking my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only tilt my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Librarian-kun, Librarian-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiiba-senpai called out to me and pulled me closer to her as she put her arm around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll leave it at that, so you tell me how Shion-chan looked on your date later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akane, stop being silly and let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since they were only a few steps apart, Hasumi-senpai could hear her, and perhaps Shiiba-senpai said it so that she could let her hear on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stuck out her tongue and quickly backed away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group then left, and I saw them off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, something was offered to me from the side of my view. It was a can of coffee, and the hand holding it belonged to Karube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the usual one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Karube. He was very thoughtful. He had already bought my usual coffee with low sugar content and opened the pull-tab while he was waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to drink it right away.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">Act 3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the library after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Makabe-kun. Today I heard you and Hasumi-san had a difficult look on your faces while talking. Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, later when there were fewer people around, Takinami Ruika appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, the matter at lunch? No, she was just asking if the lunch she prepared suited my tastes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the location, a good number of students passed by while Hasumi-senpai and I were talking, so Takinami-senpai must have caught wind of it. She must have been genuinely concerned because she knew about our complicated relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Hasumi-senpai made some for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lowered my voice because of the content of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Takinami-senpai suddenly looked as if she ate something bitter and turned her face downwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could I forget such methods?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this fine? Takinami Ruika, the object of admiration of many boys at our Akendai High School, was making a face that she shouldn’t make in public.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I met her a few times in the cafeteria, but I was so careless. If I had made some from the beginning, Shizuru might have been mine by now…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was really eager to fish me with food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Even if you did, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to bring it to me, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can just paint a picture, like the library committee member who has been helping me so much is having a hard time because of the loss of her mother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like she was going to take advantage of anything that seems viable. Well, it has been that way since a long time ago, it was too late to say anything now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if Hasumi-san knows that I’m aiming for Shizuru, and if I did tell her, will she give me her position?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she used the word &#8220;aim&#8221; with a smile, her intention</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of making me a lunchbox sounds like a predator&#8217;s scheme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Takinami-san, good afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon to you too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A female student entered the room and greeted Takinami Ruika as soon as she saw her. Takihana turned around and returned with a friendly, mature smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that’s right. This isn’t the time to be chatting around… Makabe-kun, can I have your help to find a book?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps remembering that this was the library and that many students were still coming and going at this time, she turned her smile to me across the counter. What a quick turn of attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, what kind of book is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Thank you. That’ll help.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was really a textbook conversation between an honor student and a library committee member. However, Takinami-senpai had a secret side to her, and I have an appropriate attitude toward her with each side of her. Considering this, it was really a very outward and blatant exchange of words.</span></p><div class="zetro-58b39596f4588d2ab242e05a3df77867 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-58b39596f4588d2ab242e05a3df77867"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I don&#8217;t hate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m looking for a French translation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Tale of Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… Do we have it in our library by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Tale of Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in French? Is there such a thing?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think we have that on the shelf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tap the terminal on the counter in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Le Dit Du Genji</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Is this it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I searched for it with doubt, and found something that really looked like it. I was surprised that it really existed, but I was also surprised that this library had them. I don&#8217;t know how to read it in French, so I read the alphabet as it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You found it? Let me see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that with a pleased expression, Takinami-senpai leaned forward on the counter and peeked at the terminal screen. She doesn&#8217;t have to do that because there was a rotating platform under the monitor to show the screen to users as well, but… I’m sure she was doing it on purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the terminal, trying not to look at her. It seemed to be in a case with a booklet in three parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you read French?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not. I can barely read English and classic literature.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Says who? You were named as a top achiever in both subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard from someone that the book was beautifully illustrated, so I wanted to take a look at it. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, still leaning forward against the counter, turned her head toward me from the screen and happily smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was close, so it was hard not to look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll go get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up and went to the shelves to escape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pre-bell rang at 5:55 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was five minutes before closing time, and there were only so many students left that I could count them with one hand. One of them was Kanata-senpai, who was sitting in her usual seat and running a pen on her notebook, and the other was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was looking at the French translation of &#8220;The Tale of Genji&#8221; that I had brought with me, sitting far away from Kanata-senpai. But when the remaining students left the room, leaving just her and Kanata-senpai, she stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, thanks for the book. I’m done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she came over here, she put the book on the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to borrow it? You seemed to have read it with enthusiasm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I could get your attention by pretending to be a literary girl at first, but halfway through the book, I started to dwindle. The illustrations were beautiful though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai casually said something calculating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, maybe it was the fact that she can&#8217;t be so calculating when she goes out of her way to say it. It would be scary if it was a part of her calculation to make me think that way…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like it&#8217;s a shame that I can&#8217;t read. Maybe I’ll study French when I go to college.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds great.”</span></p><div class="zetro-50031720326b2021b41848e44c584025 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-50031720326b2021b41848e44c584025"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the book and put it on the book truck of returned books at the counter. I&#8217;ll put it back on the shelf tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru. How about something like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned back to her, Takinami-senpai was again leaning forward against the counter, propping herself up on both elbows and resting her chin on her crossed hands. She then sent a provocative look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Curious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pose was also provocative. She unbuttoned one of the buttons of her blouse after all. Although the blouse was Japanese in style, so there was no cleavage to be seen, it was natural for a man to be curious about what was under her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now there&#8217;s no one around, so don&#8217;t be shy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, her dialogue was also provocative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this was the second time. When I searched for a book earlier, she did the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop being stupid. Please go home, it’s already time for closing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it was not that we were the only ones left. Don&#8217;t forget that Kanata-senpai was also present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept my distance from her, although any other guy would have his eyeballs moving around at a sickeningly high speed. I rested my body on the back of the chair, and as a member of the library committee, I asked her to leave the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai seemed somewhat dissatisfied with my attitude, and when she sat down, she put her hands on her hips in a sulky manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know what, Shizuru? I&#8217;m putting my dignity as a woman on the line here, so don&#8217;t you think you should respect it by displaying a reaction?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you put your dignity as a woman on the line, you are responsible for your own failure and success.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want to be demanded an opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru is used to seeing women&#8217;s bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then a voice breaks in. Of course, it belongs to Mibu Kanata, the last student left besides us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, Kanata-senpai, who was getting ready to leave, came up to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Mibu-san!? Shi-Shizu…what do you mean used to?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed there were so many surprises and can’t be unheard words that she jammed her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked at Kanata-senpai reflexively, but stared at me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by… No way, Hasumi-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did it come to that? Well, the only female who was involved in my personal life was Hasumi-senpai, so I guess it was a natural association. In fact, I was gradually becoming accustomed to seeing her in her usual revealing attire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily flinched at Takinami-senpai’s presence who suddenly came up to me leaning over the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I suddenly realized. ―Why was I being so stupidly honest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute. That&#8217;s got to be just her joke.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Joke…?”</span></p><div class="zetro-7f2647d0456d8a42e21519138d052d4f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7f2647d0456d8a42e21519138d052d4f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Senpai looked puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn’t I think of that possibility first? It was obvious at first glance that I was just a simple library committee with no relation to women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though, however,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai replied. She shrugged her shoulders with a smile that was truly meaningful. My mouth unintentionally leaked out a voice saying, &#8220;Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you ask Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she answered, Takinami-senpai turned to me once again. The way she turned her head was a bit horrifying. Then she moved her face closer to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru? Are you hiding something from me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are a million things I haven&#8217;t told you, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like for example?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she asked with a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m actually meeting a girl who’s about ten years old from time to time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, I didn’t know that. Introduce me next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still had a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have one, too. Like my three sizes I measured recently. Should I mention it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are we doing? Saying silly things and facing each other at a distance where our foreheads would touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. It&#8217;s no use telling people when they don&#8217;t want to know, and it&#8217;s no fun telling them when they do want to know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you don&#8217;t want to tell me, why don&#8217;t you just say so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not asking about what you were not saying, but what you are hiding. I have a feeling that you’re hiding something important, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not telling, huh? Say, why did you go silent?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked away as I kept quiet and saw Kanata-senpai was just about to leave through the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Kanata-senpai!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this what they call a bloodbath? I witnessed something great. Anyway, goodbye you two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to stop her, but Kanata-senpai was a very easy-going person. She just lit the fire and went home. This was the work of an arsonist, indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the faculty to return the key to the library, and there I bumped into Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you&#8217;re alive? Takinami is surprisingly lenient to let you go in one piece.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever you say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you come clean, get down on your knees, and ask for forgiveness?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t do that. Not like I got caught cheating. Besides, whose fault do you think that was? Saying something so unnecessary. Don&#8217;t talk about it like it&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glared at her with half-open eyes, but it didn&#8217;t seem to work on Kanata-senpai. She was an arsonist, but now she looked like an onlooker coming to watch the fire. Well, I heard that arsonists usually come back to the crime scene, so it was probably the norm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you purposely provoke Takinami-senpai to get an interesting story out of it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not into modern stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, rather than an arsonist or an onlooker, she was an empress who didn’t care about the life and death of commoners. Kanata-senpai said so, seemingly uninterested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t explain myself to Takinami-senpai. I told her that it was Kanata-senpai&#8217;s joke to begin with, and asked her to leave quickly. Needless to say, she was not happy with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A joke, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained, Kanata-senpai mumbled a few words and laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, why are you here, Kanata-senpai? Are you not gonna go home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to change the subject so that nothing more would be added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I left something in the classroom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she borrowed a key from the faculty and retrieved what she had forgotten. She came back to return the borrowed key and here we were. The empress was surprisingly human.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went home together with Kanata-senpai as the flow of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went down to the entrance and changed into the school&#8217;s designated leather shoes and loafers at our respective shoe boxes. Then, after exiting the school gate, we headed for the station side by side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s been a long time since we’ve gone home together.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We exchanged a few short words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve somehow neglected to mention this, but I&#8217;ve decided to leave Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s house and go to my grandparents&#8217; place when summer vacation rolls in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we walked side by side, I started to talk to Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From the way you put it, it doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;re just going to the countryside to have fun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right. After my mother passed away, my grandparents asked me to come to their house. I’m planning on taking on their kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was one of the few options available to me. This was probably the most realistic decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You leaving out of Hasumi’s house. Is it because it’s not healthy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-4a8dbda991cf4cdedc76240ce71445ba zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4a8dbda991cf4cdedc76240ce71445ba"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? If that&#8217;s your decision, it&#8217;s not my place to tell you what to do.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai was really quite simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami is gonna be lonely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you, Kanata-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked while sulking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You, what do you expect out of me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, Kanata-senpai asked me, and I felt a little embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For someone who plays games with Takinami, you are surprisingly childish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave me alone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I became even more sulky, Kanata-senpai gave a small shrug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As soon as you find something you’re crazy about, or start hanging out with women, you won’t care about what I think anymore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s absurd.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most students were in awe of Mibu Kanata&#8217;s supernatural demeanor and treated her as if she didn’t exist. However, in a sense, this was the flip side of her overpowering presence, and it was impossible to say that they shouldn’t be concerned about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not cut out for dating girls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe Shizuru is not cut out for love―that&#8217;s your catch phrase, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know if my emotions were spontaneous or created. I was not suited for love, as I came to create my emotions by calculation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I assure you, it will be resolved sooner or later. Like a midsummer shower, one day out of the blue.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai unusually used literary expressions even in idle chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will it be Takinami or Hasumi by your side then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just for the record, I’m half related to Hasumi-senpai. Well, in many ways, the key person is Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a favorable feeling towards Takinami Ruika. If I can assert that these were my own feelings, I may be able to take a step forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai and I parted ways, with me getting off the train first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exiting at Myodani Station―turn my back to the south side, where the Suma Patio was located, and walk to the north side, where residential areas and high-rise condominiums line the street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there I got called out in a hushed voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, it was Hasumi-senpai. Looking at her in her school uniform, it seemed that she was on her way home from school right now. Lots of people were going home late today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Hasumi-senpai.”</span></p><div class="zetro-fa87aea41d8cd5990ddc9ba579ce0b67 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-fa87aea41d8cd5990ddc9ba579ce0b67"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, weren’t you just with Mibu-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Hasumi-senpai was also in the same car and noticed us. We walked side by side to the Hasumi residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay? Maybe you don&#8217;t know this yet, but she is not well respected in our school. In junior high school, she was really strong in fights even though she was a girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think Hasumi-senpai was genuinely concerned about me. That was probably why she wondered if I was approaching Mibu Kanata, who was shunned at school, without realizing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it still ticked me off a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stories she told were generally true. Whether it was an older man or a man, she never lost, and even now, if someone accidentally slips up and puts her in a bad mood, he would be thrown to the ground before he realizes what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But now she’s just in the library after school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way! Really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She should have been there twice in the past when Kanata-senpai was there, but she probably didn’t notice because she was poking at me or teasing Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, what? That person read books? For what? Studies?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dunno. I don&#8217;t really care what people do in the library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, that was just partly true. Just as I try not to stare at the titles of the books someone borrows, I don&#8217;t care what they’re doing at their seat. You can read or study or use the library as you please. If they were doing something that disturbs others, I just give them a warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I knew exactly what Kanata-senpai was coming to the library for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, from the looks of it, she&#8217;s either reading or researching something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the only reason why ordinary high school students use the library. Hasumi seemed convinced, saying, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you worried about me, by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-of course not―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s words break off halfway through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-well, I thought it was unnecessary aid, but you know…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reiterated falteringly, scratching her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, she was worried about me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. But don&#8217;t worry. Whatever she was in the past, she’s a person of literature now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-hope that’s the case.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said shortly, as if she had instantly lost interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked side by side to the Hasumi residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not much conversation between us―and she didn’t complain about us walking together.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Act 4</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was another person who was concerned, or curious, about me and Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, it was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you seem to be getting along very well with Mibu-san yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day after school, Takinami-senpai came to the library to ask me about the situation, even though there were still a fair number of people using the library. She was wary of her surroundings because of the topic, so she lowered her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you know? She―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Rumors that she fought all the time in junior high.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I Interrupted her words as she tried to worry like Hasumi-senpai yesterday. Why do they always assume the worst? It was not like they saw it themselves, it was just a rumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? That’s right. So you knew about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interrupted her once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you can see, she’s now just a literary girl who comes here every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking beyond Takinami-senpai, I saw Kanata-senpai sitting in her usual seat, running her pen into her notebook as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, her demeanor was too supernatural to be called a &#8220;girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, you saw it yesterday. She has a very pleasant personality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though it was more of a nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instead of listening to past rumors and such, how about you see her present self?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright, I’ll do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps still having doubts about what I told her, Takinami-senpai accepted my advice in a slightly somber tone of voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As long as you understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied briefly and proceeded to operate the browsing system to search for today&#8217;s overdue books. But there were no results. It seems that there were no books that were due yesterday. There really were not many people using this library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stared at me as I went about my duties, but then she suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you mad by any chance, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Not really.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied with my eyes still on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t seem that way to me… What kind of relationship do you two have?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a librarian and a student who uses the library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Truly simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You call each other by your first names though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It just happened to be that way.”</span></p><div class="zetro-143fe4042c896737bd9b819d4686ba78 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-143fe4042c896737bd9b819d4686ba78"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever. Now I&#8217;ll put it in the &#8216;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">things you haven&#8217;t told me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216; folder instead of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;things you’re hiding</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216; folder… Come to think of it, you owe me something, don’t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the unexpected word that came out of nowhere, I looked up from my screen and turned to Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately recalled what she was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been when she helped me with the matter about Hasumi-senpai. When Hasumi-senpai ran away from home the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that you and Hasumi have settled things down, so I’m claiming it now. Go on a date with me this weekend. Of course, I won’t take no for an answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that the mess over the Hasumi family had been settled, and there was no doubt that Takinami-senpai&#8217;s help was instrumental. In that sense, I owe her one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, I don’t really mind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks for your very reluctant reply. Why not smile a little? It&#8217;s a date with me, remember?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked really displeased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way I could be happy about a decision that deprived me of a choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just a little weird. Think of my feelings as a man to be forcefully asked by a woman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Think of it simply as being approached by a woman who’s just passionate. If you don&#8217;t like it, ask me out yourself. If you say, &#8216;I won’t take no for an answer.’ I will follow you anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll think about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can&#8217;t ask that of someone who was not suited for love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, we&#8217;ll sort out the details later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai finished her talk and I answered her, she headed towards the reading table. I thought she was going to spend the rest of the day studying or reading until closing time, but unusually, today she started operating her smartphone. Well, it was not like she was bothering anyone, so I will just leave her be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sort out the details, huh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deliberately voiced my words out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know much about it, but in this area, unless you were going to a theme park, the usual places to go were Sannomiya or Harborland&#8217;s Mosaic. There was a wide range of things to do in both. If that was the case, meeting at Sannomiya was sufficient for both places. There was nothing much to decide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How about going to one of the largest Starbucks in Japan at Meriken Park?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the bell rang five minutes before 6:00 p.m and Kanata-senpai was the only student left, Takinami-senpai came to the counter once again, as if she had been waiting for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, what are we going to do on the weekend?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cutting to chase, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind anywhere. You? Have somewhere you wanna go?”</span></p><div class="zetro-3f4b14b971df50c380a2206498fb9d8d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-3f4b14b971df50c380a2206498fb9d8d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me, spending a day with you is enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, Sannomiya is a safe bet. If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll stop by a bookstore on the way. I have a book I want to buy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, the book I was looking for was not available in the bookstore in Gakuen Toshi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, it&#8217;s time to go home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as Takinami-senpai said this, the door to the library opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it a hurry to check out or return? Either way, the room will be closed in less than five minutes. We need to rush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or so I thought. But, it was Hasumi-senpai standing there. She was slightly out of breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is-is it true you have a date planned?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was neither someone loaning nor returning a book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Takinami-senpai for an explanation. If Hasumi-senpai has been informed of the matter we just decided, she was the only one who can be the culprit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s my first date after all. I just have to tell someone, you get it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of all people, why Hasumi-senpai…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you wanted someone to talk about it to, Takajou-senpai was the perfect candidate. She would often misunderstand the relationship between me and Takinami-senpai, but in fact, she clearly understands it correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with you out of breath?… Curious much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said provokingly to Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she was messaging Hasumi-senpai earlier when she was operating her smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?! Why should I care? No, nevermind that! I came to tell you to go on a date like a high school student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Takinami-senpai again. I couldn&#8217;t understand what she was saying. What did she mean by “a date like a highschool student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean if Shizuru doesn’t come home that day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would you message me that?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What on earth did she send?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it would be best to tell his sister.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m telling you to not message me unlikely things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was standing next to me, murmuring in dismay. Her reaction was natural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, if you&#8217;re gonna ask what’s the reason, I can&#8217;t really answer that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said as scratched her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would think the same thing. If you look for it, maybe there was a reason to forbid it, or maybe there was nothing at all. However, I would like my friends around me to have relationships befitting of a high school student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s not unlikely. I think I hold sufficient knowledge and I consider this the place to settle it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-settle…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-04b43228cf5e9b88c95634cda3eaa27e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-04b43228cf5e9b88c95634cda3eaa27e"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, settling scores from top to bottom, inside and out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Hasumi-senpai was holding my collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-please tell your complaints to Takinami-senpai instead of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would she get mad at me? And why does Takinami-senpai say things that agitate Hasumi-senpai so much since earlier?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there I heard a faint laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not Takinami-senpai, nor Hasumi-senpai―Turning around, it was Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mibu-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. You guys seem to be having fun after all. Shizuru, a bloodbath for real this time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that what it looks like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does this person have some special expectation on bloodbath? Even if it was, why would you look forward to seeing it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know Takinami goes here every day, but I never expected Hasumi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? What do you mean?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, with her by my side, Kanata-senpai turned her eyes toward me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re surprisingly popular, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re kidding?! Me with this guy?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after, Hasumi-senpai understood what Kanata-senpai was trying to say, and she then shouted. Hasumi-senpai was pointing at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a moment after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even I would be hurt by that, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too. Why are you denying it so straightforward? Do you really hate the idea of me liking you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We looked at each other with a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since we’re already on the topic, I’d like to go on a date too, if that&#8217;s all right. Oh, I’m fine going after Takinami and Hasumi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’d happil… Ugh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, Takinami-senpai grabbed me by the collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got some nerve to cheat in front of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Hasumi-senpai came up to me. I was being questioned by the two upperclassmen. The situation was really starting to look like a bloodbath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at Kanata-senpai from between Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senpai, she had her hand over her mouth and was laughing without letting out a sound. Unbelievable. To begin with, she knew my relation with Hasumi-senpai, there was no way she would misunderstand anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the main bell rang at 6 p.m.</span></p><div class="zetro-8c845ad134b6e52b38fae5e8f0f1470e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8c845ad134b6e52b38fae5e8f0f1470e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the place was at a standstill. No one opened their mouths, and Takinami-senpai remained clutching me by the collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’ll be going ahead first.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We waited for the chime to finish ringing―Kanata-senpai was the first one to speak out. She poured in all the energy she had and was the first to leave the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, then, I’ll be closing the library. Can you two leave the room?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, ah…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw Kanata-senpai dashing out of the library, and I took advantage of their stunned state to escape from Takinami-senpai&#8217;s hands and forcefully pushed them both out of the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then lock the door from the inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, open up!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Open up. We’re not done talking!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a siege.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like today I would have to rearrange the bookshelves, which I don&#8217;t usually do, before leaving.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align: center;">Act 5</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so came the long awaited Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The meeting place was at the east ticket gate of the Sannomiya Municipal Subway Station. From here, we can go almost anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I waited in front of an advertisement for a new apartment, Takinami-senpai showed up about five minutes after the meeting time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today she was wearing a shoulder-less top, wide pants, and a cap on her head. The other day, she was talking about settling scores, but for the time being, it appears to be a tame fashion style that takes into account the season of early summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I met Takinami Ruika in April. One thing led to another and she has been aggressively courting me for some reason. This was the first time we have met outside of school, perhaps because I have no desire to do so. This was also the first time I saw her in casual clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re quite early.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t exactly keep you waiting after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to say, &#8220;You&#8217;re late though,&#8221; but swallowed my words. It was just my usual light-hearted remark, but I didn&#8217;t want her to think I was a narrow-minded man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Takinami-senpai looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I knew she’d be here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she found something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. There was a familiar face watching us. If I’m not mistaken, that was Hasumi-senpai. She was wearing an asymmetrical camisole and low-rise skinny denim jeans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course she’d be there. You provoked her that much yesterday after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I wonder what you’re talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Senpai blatantly feigned ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all that talk about the date, even Hasumi-senpai would be curious and would want to come check on us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, even though she was curious, she didn’t want to interfere, so she didn’t talk to me while I was waiting here alone for Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, she was fatally ill-suited for spying because of her eye-catching appearance. I recognized her immediately, and even now she was being approached by a couple of guys who were either students at our school or guys who were just picking up girls. Probably the latter, as their flashy, gruff appearance and jangly accessories were unlikely to be students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They seem persistent. I’ll be back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I should go in to help, and was about to head for Hasumi-senpai, when Takinami-senpai suddenly grabbed me by the arm and held me back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. When it comes to us girls, it&#8217;s not uncommon for guys to approach us, so she can handle guys of that caliber.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounds like she was being self-conscious, but I guess it must be true. And Hasumi-senpai also didn’t make eye contact with the men, waving her palms in the air and seemingly not taking them seriously at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai started walking toward Center Gai Shopping St. I followed her with some reluctance.</span></p><div class="zetro-40ca9946bf1245fbe6fefe92a6d4f6d8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-40ca9946bf1245fbe6fefe92a6d4f6d8"></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first stop was a bookstore, as I requested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the second floor of the Center Plaza building, we entered the large bookstore via a connecting walkway over Center Street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, how is life at Hasumi-san&#8217;s house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked around for books, she asked about Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uncle is taking care of me as much as he can. I&#8217;m doing well with Hasumi-senpai now. So, on the surface, I am at peace. It&#8217;s just―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little at a loss for words, but Takinami-senpai urged me to go on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s hardly a healthy family structure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was fatal for a mistress&#8217;s child to take shelter in his father&#8217;s home, no matter how much the biological father wanted to. It should not continue for a long time, and if it continues for a long time, it will eventually collapse. That was why I decided to leave the Hasumi residence after the summer vacation started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that&#8217;s not what I want to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I urge her to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You live under the same roof with Hasumi-san, don&#8217;t you? If that&#8217;s the case, you&#8217;ll see her in something other than her school uniform, won&#8217;t you? You know, like those manga-like developments…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered the time when she came out of the bathroom wearing only a bath towel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, Shizuru. What’s with that silence? Did something happen? Something happened, right? What did you see? Tell me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a misunderstanding.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai suddenly grabbed me by the collar, and I raised both hands in the air as if saying “Violence is not good,” “Let’s talk about it.” Isn&#8217;t this a common pattern these days? I don&#8217;t want to get used to being grabbed if I can help it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone saw her grabbing me by the collar and I heard things like, “What? What? A bloodbath?” “The man should get down on his knees and apologize.” “Men should just die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you know, Hasumi-senpai is broad-minded, so her loungewear is just like that. To be honest, I&#8217;m having trouble looking at her. Well, In that sense, this is the development that you fear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that’s what you meant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed Takinami-senpai was somehow convinced. She removed her hands from my collar. Although I’m downplaying it a little bit, I was not lying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘If you want to look at something, just look at me,&#8217; is what I would like to say, but it wouldn’t suit me to dress like Hasumi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you guys are polar opposite after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that could be imitated and suited would be the naked bath towel fashion. I don&#8217;t want her to do it, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, found it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my attention back to the flatbed again, I finally found what I was looking for. I quickly picked it up.</span></p><div class="zetro-0c16775955409b504c1b83df2fa2e967 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0c16775955409b504c1b83df2fa2e967"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that what you were looking for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a new book by the historical fiction writer, Tsukasa Soichiro.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Historical fiction? Surprising. I didn&#8217;t expect you to read this kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai also picked up a book from the pile and looked at the front and back covers alternately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this the kind of thing you like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Just the writer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s it? Is it interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I read this for one reason. Because she wrote it. I bought it for the author. [T/N She?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least to me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, however, even though she was regarded as an up-and-coming writer of historical fiction, it does not seem to be translating well into sales figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact of the matter was, as far as Tsukasa Soichiro was concerned, selling was easy. There may be some favoritism, but the content was unquestionably good, so it was a matter of being noticed. So she should just be featured in a light literary magazine. A great one would be Michelangelo, a recent general literary magazine with lots of color pages. If you can get your work featured in that magazine, it will sell like hotcakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, the author herself wouldn’t want her work to increase sales with that tactic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps out of interest, Takinami-senpai began to read the back cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re curious, go ahead and read it. I have all the previous volumes, so I&#8217;ll lend them to you anytime. I&#8217;ll just go ahead and buy this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left her there―I walked past a girl standing in the magazine section, who was hiding her face, and headed for the cash register.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we wandered around, lunchtime came around and we moved to the restaurant area of the building. There we entered a Western-style restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of Takinami-san, I put up appearances and ordered a plate of steak, which was a bit expensive for a high school student to eat, while she ordered an omelet and a plate of grilled chicken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This isn’t exactly a good time to tell you this, but I’ll leave Hasumi-senpai’s house and go to my grandparents’ place when summer vacation arrives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I started tasting the food that arrived, I spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this, Takinami-senpai stopped her movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like this was the first time she heard about this, so why was she so surprised?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Wait a moment. Didn’t the problem get solved? She doesn’t exactly hate you, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now we even talk normally and she was making my lunch everyday. She even followed us because a certain somebody provoked her. I can say that our relationship is doing well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asked, looking like she didn&#8217;t understand what was the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you before, right? It’s hardly a healthy family structure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought for sure you were gonna stay in that house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t exactly do that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not trying to worry about it, but the neighborhood was aware of me coming and going out of the house. Whether I explain the situation or not, it will eventually come biting me in the back. I can still feign it for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. If that’s what you decided to do, it can&#8217;t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, feeling that there was something she wanted to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought that this isn’t the for me to be concerned about other people”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry about it, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But her reply was just hollow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you already tell her that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did. She seemed convinced.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. How unsympathetic. I thought she cared for you a little more.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sure this was how it was supposed to be. It was as natural as leaves falling to the ground. Besides, Hasumi-senpai still cares enough about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Put yourself in her shoes, how would you feel if a man not much older than you, suddenly made to live with you under one roof?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-1a19d75208acf17e0009accc0cf087ca zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1a19d75208acf17e0009accc0cf087ca"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I&#8217;ll welcome it with open arms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai replied with a smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s me you’re imagining. What if it&#8217;s a guy you&#8217;ve never met before…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, ok, sure…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this time, she became meek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s position.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you and her are different. You may have barely met, but you’re connected by blood even if it’s just half.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is both good and bad. In fact, this time Hasumi&#8217;s anger was directed at his father, but it could have been directed at me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Hasumi-senpai was very rational. Normally, she would have turned her hatred towards me without even realizing that it was unreasonable and misguided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, I can say goodbye with a smile. An unbelievable good ending, no?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then how about going back to your old house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinam-senpai suggested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought about it but―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll even come by seven times a week to take care of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just now, it disappeared without a trace from the list of options.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyday?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, at one time I considered staying in that house. But I had too many memories of my mom there. To be honest, it was hard for me to be alone there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Takinami-senpai again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She noticed my gaze and asked me about it, to which I responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have previously analyzed my feelings, because I was able to avoid sinking into deep sorrow since I left home immediately after my mom&#8217;s death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe she was one of the saving graces in that regard…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was concerned about me, but she didn&#8217;t stop at that, and made advances to me in the same way as before. Me, on the other hand, was somewhat comforted by her attitude, even though I also treated her in the same casual manner as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after Mom’s death, my daily life remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After this, If you find something you like, I’ll buy it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a great opportunity. I should get her a gift as a thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really!? I&#8217;m so happy. Alright, I&#8217;ll find something expensive to buy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Please don’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sound of despair. Seeing me like this, Takinami-senpai happily smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, being her, I was sure she would choose a moderately priced item, and she must be aware of my desire to thank her, so she will not refuse.</span></p><div class="zetro-e7895f8ffe6eaf48e208dbd77ccfdf78 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e7895f8ffe6eaf48e208dbd77ccfdf78"></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After lunch, we moved to Kobe MARUI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here, we looked around the ladies&#8217; floor. Naturally, there were only branded stuff, but it was amazing that she could find something that would look good on a high school student. If we even stopped for a moment to take a look, the store staff would immediately rush to us, not wanting to miss out on the sales pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dragging me around. I had no choice but to wait until she was done dealing with and fending off the clerk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around and saw a lingerie store nearby. As a man, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, pervert. Look at you, looking so intensely.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Takinami-senpai came back. She was giggling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Done?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Are you gonna buy me some? I wonder what you’ll choose. I’m looking forward to it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to say that there were no high school students who would, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you expecting? Unfortunately, I have no such plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, how about you do boyfriend-like stuff for once? Acting all shy and reserved is good and all, but man up once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not even dating in the first place.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai’s provocation made me a little annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let’s go then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke and stepped out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And where I headed to was―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, wait a second, Shizuru. Where do you think you’re going?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai rushed to stop me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was understandable that she was upset. I had entered the lingerie store in question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re the one who told me to choose for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did say that, but…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored her confusion and went around the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a quick look around, I picked up a few items I had my eye on ― all of them were a set of a bra and panties ― and I shoved them at Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one, this one, and this one. I don&#8217;t know the size though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, you really picked some up?! Oh, this doesn’t look bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was surprised, but immediately looked at it with interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ones I chose were too mature of a design for a high school student to wear, but perhaps for Takinami-senpai, it would probably suit her. The colors were all clean white. I&#8217;m glad I was able to choose ones that she liked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, how did you know what to choose?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-4df6225c05e24dd38a85acf42e7d2c1b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4df6225c05e24dd38a85acf42e7d2c1b"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Takinami-senpai was slightly shivering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a trade secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which company’s trade secret it was, I wonder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai seemed to have had a flash of inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You chose what you wanted me to wear, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Definitely not. Alright, I’ll be outside. Whether you want to buy it or not, it’s your choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned on my foot and turned my body to the outside of the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you’re not gonna buy it for me? For the gift, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not stingy. I&#8217;m willing to buy you something, but choose another thing. If I buy it, it&#8217;s going to complicate things a bit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left her and went outside the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there I let out a deep sigh. In Takinami-senpai&#8217;s eyes, it might have looked as if I had chosen it easily. But to tell the truth, like many boys, I was not good at this kind of thing. In fact, I don&#8217;t think there was anyone who was good at it. Of course, you don&#8217;t get used to it even if you have a lot of experience. That was exhausting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, Takinami-senpai came out. In her hand was another bag with the store&#8217;s logo printed on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for the wait, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you buy it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But the size was a little different. I wonder if I should tell you my three sizes. Also, what design do you like? You know, for reference.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t need that kind of information. I picked some on the spur of the moment, but I’m never doing this again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I retorted, Takinami-senpai chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never thought you had such a sense of style for this kind of stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then her eyes suddenly wandered around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you know, Shizuru…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her speech became unclear and her face was slightly red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you… um… imagine it when you chose these?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, she was wondering whether I chose it because I imagined her wearing it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t exactly answer the question. Of course, when giving someone an outfit, I think about whether or not it will look good on them, and I do simulations in my head. It goes without saying.</span></p><div class="zetro-cb08b4e1fc8f22ac785321cb6ed3f20f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cb08b4e1fc8f22ac785321cb6ed3f20f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this also another trade secret?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess that’s how it’s gonna be.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the second time, what kind of company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. That so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai seemed to have guessed the right answer as I kept my mouth shut. She gave a nasty smile, a complete change from earlier. Hey, whatever-company, what was this about? Aren’t you being too lax in managing confidential information?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru? Since you went through the trouble of picking these, should I tell you when I put it on? Or should I not only tell you, but also show it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to say it. You also don’t have to show it. I don’t have time for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I refused flat out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… You know, I like the type where the side is tied with a lace, can you help me pick one out again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?! Absolutely not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She saw this as an opportunity to go on the offensive, so I shook off Takinami-senpai, who was clinging to me, and I started to walk away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I haven&#8217;t decided where to go.</span></p>

<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Act 6</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to look around MARUI and bought some affordable accessories for Takinami-senpai as a gift, until she suddenly looked at her watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think we should call it a day.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my watch, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was still 4 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we go home now, I will be home before five o&#8217;clock. Even elementary school students don&#8217;t go home this early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad to hear that, but for the rest of the time, you should spend it with Hasumi-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? With Hasumi-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You will be leaving Hasumi-san&#8217;s house soon, right? Then, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to do something as siblings before that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to do so, as long as I’m not being hated. However, I wasn’t sure if Hasumi-senpai would want such a thing…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I suddenly realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t tell me you provoked Hasumi-senpai for this purpose?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was this the reason why you let her follow us after provoking her that much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I had to, otherwise she wouldn’t be honest, y’know? At first I thought this would be a great opportunity for you two to get closer, but I didn’t think this would be such a memorable experience for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, it’s the same for you too, right? Takinami-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It does not mean that we will never see each other again, but it will be a gradual process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with you today? You&#8217;ve been saying a lot of nice things to me. It&#8217;s as if your attitude towards me before was a lie.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai widened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m probably gonna ask you for another date before summer vacation. Anyway, stay here, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said this to me, and without hesitation, she walked straight ahead―eventually disappearing into the crowd of people passing by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand Takinami-senpai&#8217;s intention. But was Hasumi-senpai still there in the first place? I had to deal with Takinami-senpai, so I lost sight of her in the middle. If she wasn’t here, she may have already gotten bored and gone home. However, Takinami-senpai looked convinced that she was still here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, what’s with you?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, a voice came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked towards the voice, I saw that Takinami-senpai was pushing Hasumi-senpai. And for some reason, she was coming back from the opposite direction of where she had disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she brought Hasumi-senpai in front of me.</span></p><div class="zetro-c2095461e17072a36fa52c11bb1d3117 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c2095461e17072a36fa52c11bb1d3117"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, you’re here too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai crossed her arms, turned away her head, and spoke in a condescending manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Uh, did you know from the very beginning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you stand out after all, Hasumi-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, this person was out of the loop. As expected of Uncle’s daughter. With her gorgeous appearance, fashion that sometimes reveals a glimpse of her flanks, it would have been impossible for her not to catch people&#8217;s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry but can you take care of the rest, Hasumi-san? I suddenly have to go home now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No, I’m…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Thank you. I’m counting on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai </span><span style="font-weight: 400">didn&#8217;t even bother to listen to her</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, or rather, she completely ignored her and pushed me towards Hasumi-senpai, and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What remained was me and Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, was that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we wander for a bit and then head home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. I’ve been following you guys, so I haven’t seen much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because you’re spending your precious weekend on something stupid. You get what you deserve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai just wanted to eat something, so she went to the first thing she saw and bought a soft-serve ice cream shop, vanilla flavor with chocolate coating. I also bought the orthodox vanilla flavor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys are really close, huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said somberly as she stood in front of the store eating the ice cream. She can’t walk around with that. I guess she was planning to eat it here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t know Takinami-san could make a face like that. She always has that graceful smile, but she provoked me and even smiled innocently at you. Two-faced was it? I don&#8217;t think I can imitate her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone has his or her own strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, it’s your openness that makes you attractive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ca-can you not say something so embarrassing?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glared at me. However, since she looked embarrassed with her face tinted with red, it lacked pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you? Do you like Takinami-san?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so she continued, trying to divert the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably? Make it clear.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not suited for it, the person named Makabe Shizuru, for romance.”</span></p><div class="zetro-25eede433cf5a20782a5d2582a307337 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-25eede433cf5a20782a5d2582a307337"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that I have feelings for Takinami Ruika. But were these truly genuine? Can I confidently say that these feelings weren’t made to suit her wishes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied, sounding convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t know much about love either. Love or whatnot. The people around me make a lot of noise about it, but it’s not my thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she made it clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Hasumi-senpai took my earlier words to mean that she wasn’t interested in a colorful love affair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, shall we go home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Satisfied with her soft-serve ice cream, she simply rolled up the paper on the cone and tossed it into the trash can in front of the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, please don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, it was nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to hang out and walk around with Hasumi-senpai a little more. I wished this time could last a little longer, that was all, nothing more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no way I could say that. I just wish we had that kind of relationship to be able to say it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You see? Hasumi-senpai isn&#8217;t thinking in the slightest about making memories with me for the last time.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I mocked myself inwardly, it still felt lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I finally figured it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sure that I wanted her to acknowledge me as family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My half-sister, whom I met when I lost my only immediate family and was taken in provisionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew her before I met her in that house; she was a senior who was very popular with the boys at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said to me, a testament to her father’s betrayal. ―</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You were just born, you are innocent.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was how I got saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought that not only had I lost my mother, I would be hated, and even be denied of my own birth, but those words saved me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, somehow, I became greedy. ―I wanted her to acknowledge me as family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was naive. It was a fleeting fantasy. After all, it was hardly a healthy family structure, as I said myself, and she had no desire to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That so? If it’s nothing, let’s head home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright… look out. In front.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, I was speaking as fast as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Hasumi-senpai turned on her heel to head for the station, there was a person standing in front of her, and she crashed into him.</span></p><div class="zetro-0c5eecb73beea160ee300d5b82b18b0d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0c5eecb73beea160ee300d5b82b18b0d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was an accident, fine. But to my eyes, it looked as if the man was standing there as if he was blocking Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, my bad. I wasn’t looking at the way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai apologized, holding her bumped nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Aren’t you the girl from earlier this morning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I look at the other person again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw him too. I was looking at a distance, but his flashy, gruff appearance and jangly accessories looked a lot like the people who were picking up women in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alone? Actually, I’m alone too. About bumping me, it’s fine don’t worry about it. In exchange, can you accompany me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was the same for me. This guy… pretended as if he found Hasumi-senpai again by accident, but was standing in a position to deliberately bump into her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sorry but I’m with this one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pointed at me using her chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your friend? Come on, instead of that dull looking guy, hang out with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sorry about that, for being dull. I&#8217;m an average peep, after all. But I think it was better than being a bad looking guy who can&#8217;t hide his bad attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, so lame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai rolled her eyes, and the man sounded menacing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s good manners to withdraw quietly when you are rejected. But to be turned down twice and still not back down, that&#8217;s really something, isn&#8217;t it? Maybe I&#8217;m supposed to be impressed, but it’s really astounding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai lined up her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man&#8217;s face turned bright red as he looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This looks quite bad…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was camly analyzing the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s personality, she would clearly state her likes and dislikes, it came out beautifully. However, in this case, straight talk only served to offend the other party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll f*cking kill you, b***h.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment I saw a knife in his hand. Dammit… he was just a delinquent, huh? Also the type that would commit crimes in the future. What era are you from? Who else carries a knife these days?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Hasumi-senpai, who was not afraid, looked horrified.</span></p><div class="zetro-d7b91ccdb40527e4e6869eed69e88348 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d7b91ccdb40527e4e6869eed69e88348"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man goes towards Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was running at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I protect her by pushing her away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, came intense pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntary cower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it should be, if you look at my left arm, there was a knife stuck in it. The pain was often described as if someone had stuck a burning iron into your arm, and I guess this was exactly what it felt like. And yet, for some reason, it also felt strangely cold. It felt like my teeth were gonna come out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai rushed over to me and looked alternately at my face and the knife that stabbed me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa-are you okay?!?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked me, but I have a knife stuck deep into my arm. There was no way I would be okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, about it…!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grasped the handle of the knife and pulled it out with great force. [T/N If you ever get stabbed don’t do this, it would only worsen the bleeding. You might faint from blood loss or even die.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A hair-raising sensation ran through my body, and then another sharp pain shot through me. But I shook it off and stood up unsteadily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dropped the bloody knife in front of the man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hih…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man already looked so pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was good that he wielded the knife in anger at being made fun of, but he must have realized that he had done a terrible thing when he hurt someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That doesn&#8217;t mean I can forgive him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How dare you try to take away my family…! I won’t let you take away anymore of my precious family…!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I punched the man with all my might. [T/N While his left arm was bleeding btw] [E/N Could be punching with his right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man was blown away, and he remained motionless. Was he comatosed, or was he unable to stand up due to the shock of having stabbed someone with a knife? [E/N What? Was he that strong? One punch to blow a guy away?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I landed on my knees again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru! Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was about to faint from the pain and bleeding, I heard Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s voice in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ah, that’s the first time she ever mentioned my name…’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I was taken by an ambulance and given proper treatment at the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, there were no major blood vessels or nerves damage, so it was not likely to be serious. I didn’t get hospitalized either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the treatment, I went straight to the police station from the hospital for a brief interview ― and after that, I called Hasumi-san. He had heard the news from Hasumi-senpai. He told me that he was on duty today and could not move, but that he had called the hospital directly and asked the emergency doctors to take care of me. I don&#8217;t think that will make any difference in the treatment though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so the next Sunday, it was just the two of us at breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That looks hard.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it’s because of this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had my left arm strapped to my neck because moving it too much would worsen the wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Hasumi-senpai making a Western-style breakfast, I can mostly eat it with one hand. However, there were some things I couldn&#8217;t eat with one hand. For example, bread. I can&#8217;t spread jam with one hand. It wouldn&#8217;t work even if you put it on a plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I resolutioned myself to eat it without anything on it, Hasumi-senpai, who was sitting across from me, snatched the whole plate of bread away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai carefully spread jam on the bread &#8211; and not long after, the plate came back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buy some pastries for today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai bluntly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we returned to our meal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru,”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai suddenly called my name.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;where’s your reply?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I’m sorry. I was just thinking.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that my mind was just wandering around. Prompted by a gruff voice, I hastily responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, she addressed me as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you clean out your house and get ready to move with those hands?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s difficult, but I just have to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should do what I can do and ask Karube for help. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll just hire a moving company. It will probably be expensive, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">but it might be</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> a good idea to include an alternate plan where I just leave the entire moving to the moving company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had planned to leave as soon as summer vacation started, but at this rate it will take a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that moment while I was lost in thought, Hasumi-senpai suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you stay with us for a little longer?”</span></p><div class="zetro-4474713f1e5ebd327a06fc759d490fa5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4474713f1e5ebd327a06fc759d490fa5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, with that hand, it will be inconvenient, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai sulkingly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess. What do you mean by… a little longer?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How would I know? Until your injury heals, or until you graduate from high school and enter college, or after college. You do whatever you want, Shizuru. It’s normal for a family to stay together, but you’re a man and you’re gonna leave home at some point. You should decide for yourself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so overwhelmed by her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was probably Hasumi-senpai’s way of showing her consideration, but the atmosphere was not such that I can thank her for it ― so the meal continues in silence once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we did, Hasumi-senpai opened her mouth again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so, how long are you…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same words, but this time she was the one who asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can do whatever I want, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;You, you’re surprisingly a jerk.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glared at me with her eyes half-closed.</span></p>
