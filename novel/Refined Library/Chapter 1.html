<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 1 -  Makabe Shizuru and His Seniors: Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just about a week ago, in June, my mom died.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a traffic accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just me and her, my mom. A fatherless family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which meant, I just lost my one and only family member, and was left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, on the same day the funeral was finished that was organized with the help of my relatives, something happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At night, I was feeling helpless inside an apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was confronted with my mom&#8217;s corpse, I broke down in tears. I may be a guy, but I’m still a seventeen year old high school student. I hope you won&#8217;t call me pathetic for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I soon found myself busy with the traditions around funerals, and had no time to mourn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cremation was over before I knew it, and when I returned home with the remains and a portrait of the deceased. I no longer had the energy to cry again and was just at a loss for words in the vastness of the house I was left alone in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was pondering over what to do now, the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up in a helpless motion. It was then that I realized that the sun had already set, and the first thing I did was to turn on the lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the front door without caution. Standing there was a middle-aged man, elegantly dressed in a high-class suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you Makabe Shizuru-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked at me straight in the eye and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makabe Shizuru is indeed my name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, what of it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded my head, he replied with deep emotion. He then looked at me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May I ask who you are?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, of course. I’m your mother’s colleague and this is who I am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pulled out a business card from it and held it out to me. I didn&#8217;t know how to accept a business card, so I accepted it with both hands as politely as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had his name and the name of a University Hospital not too far away, and indicated that he was a cardiologist there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom was a nurse at the same hospital. Although doctors and nurses belonged to different departments, they could certainly be called colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve just been away from the country for an academic conference. I just heard about your mother&#8217;s death a few days ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If his words were correct, then he must have heard the news of mom’s death and quickly flew to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I couldn&#8217;t attend the funeral, but I hope I can at least pay respect to her remains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Thank you for taking the trouble. I&#8217;m sure my mother will be happy to hear that. Please come in.”</span></p><div class="zetro-db138c2dc4f781861213c39f82e450e6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-db138c2dc4f781861213c39f82e450e6"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Convinced of the purpose of his visit, I quickly invited him in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother raised me single-handedly, but she was an experienced nurse who also served as the head nurse and was paid quite well, so I never had to worry much about my financial situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This house is a 2LDK apartment, but it was more than enough for a single mother and child to live in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the corner of the living room, there was a simple altar with a picture of mom and her remains on it. He sat down in front of the picture and put his hands together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, I decided to prepare some tea for the visitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom was a busy person, befitting of her position and career. That&#8217;s why I often took over the household chores, and I can do this level of work without putting in much attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to the living room after preparing a cup of tea, he was still sitting in front of the altar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Keiko-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was then that I heard his mumbling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my mom’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I made you some tea, if you want, go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pretend not to hear him and call out to his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he jolted in surprise, as if he didn&#8217;t think I was back, or had forgotten about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no immediate reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, he pressed the handkerchief he was holding against his eyes. I couldn&#8217;t see it from here, but I wondered if it was tears that he had just wiped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Thank you. I’ll take it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After doing so, he finally replied in a slightly raised voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He replied, but despite his words, he did not leave the altar at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed my palms on my thighs and stared at my mom&#8217;s remains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it for a while, and then I decided to throw some words at his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;m wrong. You&#8217;re my father, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, his body tensed slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How did you know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with his back to me, he asked me, choosing his words carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were several factors to conclude from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One was the way he looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other was his back while he was looking at my mom’s remains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither was something he would show to his colleague or his colleague’s son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know much about relationships among work colleagues. But would a mere co-worker call her first name and stare at her remains as if he was in deep grief? Would he know the name of the son of a mere colleague and look at him with such loving eyes? I&#8217;ve lived my whole life without knowing my father. But those are the eyes of a father, aren&#8217;t they?</span></p><div class="zetro-e51a8d43c9360f493748e466ebd0b8c0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e51a8d43c9360f493748e466ebd0b8c0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a hunch.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t think there was any point in explaining it out here, so I just said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had to put it into words, I would say it was my intuition as a blood-related parent and child. Rather, I would say that I looked for a reason after I had such a feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did your mother say anything about your father?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular. But on the other hand, looking back, I don&#8217;t think she ever said that my father is dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he finally left the altar and sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been standing since I put the teacup on the low table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was already married at the time, and your mother, well, It was a relationship that we can’t openly declare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took a sip of his tea to moisten his throat and began to speak without clearly affirming my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, naturally, we couldn&#8217;t stay in the relationship for long. I knew that she had a child, being you, because of our relationship, but I left her knowing that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because I had figured it out on my own, but I wasn&#8217;t too surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This person is my father.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I listened to his confession, I became convinced that he was right, but at the same time, I calmly thought that my mother and I might have been supported by the child support he paid. Thinking like this is my bad habit, or rather, my nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you seen our hospital?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have, several times.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a University Hospital in front of the subway station, about five stops from here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I have never been to a hospital as a sick or injured person. In the first place, Japan&#8217;s medical system does not allow people to suddenly rush to a large hospital unless it is an emergency. I simply ate at the outpatient cafeteria with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a big hospital, right? So it was surprisingly easy to avoid seeing each other if you were in different departments. But I never thought I&#8217;d never see her again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked down at the teacup he held in both hands and murmured sadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must be sad for him to have her to leave this world without any warning, even if they haven&#8217;t seen each other for a long time after settling the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if he had been waiting for it, he looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you going to do from now on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From now on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I question him back.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. I think it&#8217;s too hard for a high school student to live alone here. Or do you have relatives you can rely on?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My grandparents called out to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was &#8216;just in case&#8217; however.</span></p><div class="zetro-5e08545555f030e13b9c3981cb033c61 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5e08545555f030e13b9c3981cb033c61"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. If it’s fine with you, uhm…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here he slurred his words as if he had difficulty saying them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it&#8217;s fine with you, why don&#8217;t you come to us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he cut off his words again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t do anything for her now that she&#8217;s dead, but I think it&#8217;s my duty as a parent to do what I can for you, who was left behind… What do you think? Would you like to come to my house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, he wants to take me in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but feel his strong sense of responsibility as he laundered his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fortunately, if you could call it that. My wife died a few years ago. You can be sure you will have no concerns about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He repeated his words, trying to convince me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a daughter who&#8217;s about your age. I think she&#8217;d make a good conversation partner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think so, that’s more of an obstacle, isn&#8217;t it? If a person of the opposite s*x of the same age suddenly came to stay in her house, I don&#8217;t think she would fancy the person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it was my turn to look down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked down and thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it’s not gonna be that easy, huh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother was a single mother who stubbornly refused to tell who the father of her child was. Because of this, she was not taken seriously by her relatives. Still, she was one of their relatives, and since she died too early in her mid-forties, they came to the funeral. They even proceeded with the memorial service, which was too heavy for a high school student like me. Talk about being ostracized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, nothing has been decided after this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this day and age, it&#8217;s not so easy to add one more family member to the mix. It&#8217;s even more difficult when it&#8217;s relatives you haven&#8217;t had much contact with. My grandparents were the only ones who approached me, but as with my habit, I suspected it was just lip service, so I withheld my answer. Unless I proactively asked for help, no one would want to get involved with me anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Now then, how do I feel about the person in front of me?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is my father. I don&#8217;t want to single-handedly accuse him of abandoning my mother, because I don&#8217;t know what was going on at the time or how she felt. But the fact is that he had an affair with my mother even though he was married.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s when I thought about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, how about just a month?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“A month?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I titled my head at the strange suggestion that came out of his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your mother&#8217;s funeral is over, but there are still some complicated procedures to be completed. You also have your own life and schoolwork to attend to, Shizuru-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the part I was at a loss for. After my mother&#8217;s funeral, not everything was over. The 50th day of her death was soon to follow, and there were still things like the grave and bones to be buried. According to my relatives, the grave of my mother&#8217;s family is not near here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I still have to go to high school, attend classes, and take exams. Just because I lost my parents doesn&#8217;t mean that the school will accommodate the unfortunate student.</span></p><div class="zetro-78a676cfc3a628aed60129382667bb51 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-78a676cfc3a628aed60129382667bb51"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, if you come to my house for at least a month, until the summer vacation starts, I think your burden will be reduced a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I do as he says, at least the burden of daily life will be greatly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anything after that, you can just think about it again. If you like it, you can just stay. And, uhm…If you don’t feel great about me, you can always choose another way. Of course, I’ll do everything I can to help you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than pressuring me to make a choice, he looks at me with a pleading look. As a parent, he must be compelled to do something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, he would certainly be right and I would not feel good about him. But if you are going to accuse him of having an affair with my mom while he was married, it would not be fair if you did not also accuse mom for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as I calmly checked my own feelings, I realized that I probably had nothing against him at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t have the right conditions to have negative feelings towards him in the first place. I have never heard my mother complain about him, and considering the fact that she was working with him and did not take any action, I think the relationship ended satisfactorily enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He himself seemed to have at least some sense of responsibility for what had happened, whether it was rushing over here or trying to take me in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now what should I do in this case?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I was thinking calmly and reasonably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. I&#8217;ll be in your care for a month for starters.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see! Thank you. With this, I can finally have some peace with myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He cheered with delight and grabbed my hand with both of his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably the best solution right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I have no idea what to do with myself. However, I would prefer not to rely on a family member who does not want to be relied on. And more than anything, that&#8217;s what he wants. Then, I should let him do what he wants to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s not a bad deal for me, either.</span></p>


<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 2</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That week on Sunday, I visited his house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a subway to his house. The house of the Hasumi family was just a short walk away from the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a large mansion. As expected of a doctor, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first he offered to pick me up, but I refused. Partly because I wanted to think things over while walking slowly on my own feet, and also because I thought it would be better to buy some snacks. Thanks to this, I had a large sports bag filled with the necessities in my hand, as well as a paper bag of Japanese sweets I had bought at a store in front of the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my watch to confirm that it was 1 o’clock in the afternoon, which was the appointed time. I took a deep breath, then rang the chime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Who is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after, a somewhat listless female voice answered over the intercom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s Makabe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, I thought I heard a faint sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;Come on in. The gate is already open, the front door will soon open too.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short pause, that was all that was said, and the intercom was cut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to do as I was told.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gate was indeed open, and as I walked up to the front porch, the door opened as if it was timed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl came out of the door wearing an open-shouldered top and denim shorts. She had short brown hair and large eyes. Perhaps because it was Sunday, her makeup was conservative and she looked like a sporty girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily widened my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the liveliness I always felt when I saw her at school was nowhere to be found. Now she was looking at me without a trace of a smile, and was fuming. To put it simply, she seemed to be in a very bad mood. It was not the kind of attitude one would put in front of a visitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I thought about it, the business card he gave me mentioned his name to be “Hasumi”, I thought I heard it somewhere, so it was Hasumi-senpai, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That reaction-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like you know me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you’re quite famous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along with Takinami Ruika, she is our school’s bright jewels. There is no one in our school who doesn’t know them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’re a student of our school, huh? If I’m not mistaken… you’re from the library committee, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Hasumi-senpai also knew me. It’s true that I’m a member of the library committee, and I remember seeing Hasumi-senpai visiting the library several times. We must have exchanged a few words, though it was probably not much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, this sucks…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-cfda8dd7f061651bdc3d396eb976cc01 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cfda8dd7f061651bdc3d396eb976cc01"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she immediately turned to look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever… Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Hasumi-senpai released her hand that was holding the door and disappeared inside, asking me to follow her. I grabbed the door k**b as it was about to close and followed her in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was led to the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The living room is as spacious as the exterior of the mansion. It was naturally incomparable to the house where me and my mother lived, and it was larger than any other house I knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there is no one there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had assumed that Hasumi-san would be here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sit down wherever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her word and sat down on one of the sofas. I put my sports bag and a paper bag of Japanese sweets beside it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me, but where’s y̶o̶u̶r dad?” [TN: This is a word play, I really can’t translate this.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Hasumi-senpai sharply glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately sensed what was upsetting her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I meant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> dad. I&#8217;m also not convinced either. I still can&#8217;t get my head around it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Dad was called to the hospital on short notice because something happened to one of the patients he was in charge of. It happens all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happens all the time, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did the patient&#8217;s condition suddenly change? I hope the patient is fine. It’s quite hard when a person around us dies at a completely unexpected time. Thinking of this, I felt as if my chest were tightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t get my head around it either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai suddenly spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up to see her walking toward me from the kitchen, holding a tray with two glasses of what appeared to be cold tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai silently put the glass on the low table and sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really loved my mother. Although, she already died five years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t really dislike my dad. I&#8217;m an only child, so it&#8217;s just him and me now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was from a fatherless family, and Hasumi was from a motherless family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been extremely painful for her to be separated from her mother, who had been by her side everyday. I was only with my mom, that’s why I can understand her painfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But now what? You&#8217;re telling me that dad was actually cheating and I actually have a little brother?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s more, he&#8217;s my junior at the same school. Gimme a break!”</span></p><div class="zetro-6024a0cc2fc9ddca86d65ab659ca6843 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6024a0cc2fc9ddca86d65ab659ca6843"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, she lifts her back from the sofa, leans forward, and declares once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, but I don’t think I’ll be able to recognize you as a family anytime soon. Just remember that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was silent without any words to say back. I softly sighed in my mind. “Good conversation partner” my a*s. It doesn&#8217;t look like that’s going to happen at all. It seems that Hasumi-san has failed to understand his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if anything, I can sympathize with Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s feelings. It would be stranger for her to suddenly accept the fact that her dad cheated in the past, and then be told that she has a half-brother. Furthermore, having suddenly made to live with that half-brother of hers, her complaints were valid to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I would be perplexed if a girl only a year older or a year younger than me suddenly became my older sister or younger sister and had to stay with me. I wish that kind of development would only exist in a novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, I had a feeling that I should give Hasumi-san some face, or rather, let him be satisfied. It would be easy for me to leave this place, considering Hasumi-senpai feelings. But if I did so, Hasumi-san would not be able to fulfill his duties as a parent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there were not many options for me to take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘After a month, I’ll leave…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made up my mind to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would give Hasumi-senpai her ordinary life back, and would also satisfy Hasumi-san to some extent for his duties as a parent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was what had happened in the last few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rapid development of this drama-like situation was just nothing but astonishing.</span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After not going to school for quite some time, I visited the library when class finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not for borrowing books, rather for committee work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Hasumi-senpai pointed out, I belong to the library committee. What’s more, I’m its only member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The work of a library committee is not particularly hard. The library is open after school and closes at 6 pm. During the open hours, the work consists of checking out the books to borrow, handling books to be returned, and organizing the shelves. The more complicated tasks, such as book selection, purchasing, and receiving new books, are the responsibilities of the faculty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was told that while I was absent due to unavoidable circumstances, the teacher who was available opened the library and sat at the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the library with the key I received from the staff room, the first thing I saw was a pile of returned books on the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I kinda expected this but…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher who handled the library must have only checked out and received returned books on his own while doing his own work at the counter, and did little to organize it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was looking at the pile of books to be organized, someone walked past from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a female student in the 12th grade who always gets in first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long, straight black hair flutters as she sits in her usual seat by the window. We haven&#8217;t seen each other in quite some time, so it might be nice to say something. Since we’re acquaintanced and all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly turned on the computer. Since It would probably take quite a while for it to get up and running, I decided to organize the books before then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to work, students soon arrived here and there. Most of them are regulars. Some of them approached me since I was away for a while. They asked me how I&#8217;ve been, but I just replied nonchalantly, I don’t really want the story to spread after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at that time when I almost finished organizing the books that had accumulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice that had a melodic tone called my name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up from my seat and saw a neat and tidy beauty with her long hair carefully set standing there, smiling. The soft lines outlining her eyes gave a gentle impression to those who looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takanami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is often mentioned together with Hasumi Shion, the other pair of jewels our school were proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I passed you by the hallway at lunchtime, so I knew you were already at school but it&#8217;s nice to see your face here after a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I can’t exactly be absent forever.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded, Takinami-senpai&#8217;s smile suddenly clouded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I heard your mother passed away. Makabe-kun, are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she knew about my situation. Since I was absent from the committee for a long time, she must have asked my homeroom teacher or the teacher who is the advisor of the library committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;d be lying if I said I was fine. Since I just lost my one and only mother. However, I can’t grieve forever, so I’ll get my feelings sorted out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. You’re quite strong. If you need any help, just let me know, okay? I can help you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takanami Ruika is this kind of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is not as easygoing as Hasumi-senpai, and it is difficult to talk to her when you have little contact with her, but she treats everyone equally. This is probably what makes her so popular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I appreciate it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-3866b8380661c899489261b75d1e7646 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-3866b8380661c899489261b75d1e7646"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expressed my gratitude to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For me to, no, we’re both being quite obvious to each other… although it’s late to say that now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But inwardly, that’s what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the wall clock and saw that the two hands were already pointing to 5:50 PM. Ten minutes before closing. While I was quietly putting away the stacks of books, more time had passed than I had expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around the library, I saw only two students remaining. The girl from third grade who first entered the library and another boy who seemed to be studying hard were the only two left. The latter seemed to be just about to leave, and was just now getting up to grab his bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and Takinami-senpai silently watched the student leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just after the student disappeared, as if she had been waiting for it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, Shizuru, isn&#8217;t it awful for you to not contact me at all? We were worried because you&#8217;ve been absent for so long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai&#8217;s soft smile was gone, and she turned her face to me as she leaned forward on the counter, looking really dissatisfied. If I was wearing winter clothes, she might have grabbed my tie and pulled it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no obligation to inform you, Takinami-senpai. Being that you’re basically a stranger to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me, on the other hand, flipped the switch in return. I reply in a curt manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Shall we officially date, then? That way, we won’t be strangers anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re always saying that when you get the chance, don’t you? I humbly refuse.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika is also this kind of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the surface, she is a gentle, soft-spoken honor student who leads a quiet life in high school. But beneath the mask, this is how she is. When there is no one around and it is just the two of us, this is what happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is one thing in common between me and Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that is—.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <span style="font-weight: 400">§§§</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only recently that I managed to get to know a woman named Takinami Ruika. It was this spring when I entered the 11th grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I was sitting at the counter as the only member of the library committee when she appeared just as the library was closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai entered the library somewhat nervously. She probably does not use the library very often. But I imagine that she had to come here for a reason &#8211; I calmly deduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And my eyes suddenly met hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simultaneously, I put on a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello, Takinami-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A greeting with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no response from her. On the contrary, Takinami-senpai turned her cold, somewhat observant gaze on me, something I had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm, That Takinami-senpai also makes this kind of face, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite surprising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was nothing great</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I observed her as much as she did. Soon after this, I realized that I gave Takinami-senpai the same amount of time to observe me as well. It was only for a few moments, but it was enough for her.</span></p><div class="zetro-8335dbd8f298ab267e61439ca4a3454d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8335dbd8f298ab267e61439ca4a3454d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Takinami-senpai said those words with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it probably lasted less than ten seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you looking for any books?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stood in front of the counter, pretending to think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as if looking for my reaction, she continued with her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly found myself lost for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timing of that line, uttered at this point in time, is just like mine from earlier. What on earth was Takinami-senpai&#8217;s intention?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a famous quote. There are several books by Nietzsche here and there, If I’m not mistaken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet I quickly regain my footing and comply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you from the library committee? What&#8217;s your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s Makabe Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Makabe, Shizuru, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai pronounced my name carefully, checking how it rolls off the tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. You’re a celebrity, Takinami-senpai. I doubt there’s any boys in the school who don&#8217;t know you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I don’t remember being that famous.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you are looking for a book, I can help you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai and I exchange words one after another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earlier I thought I was being observed by her, but was it just my imagination? Just as I was thinking, it flew in like a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, books are good for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nevermind that― say, Makabe-kun. Do you ever camly look at your current situation from a third-person view?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell silent in alarm.</span></p><div class="zetro-428be20f4dc5b1edeb8be098bb83e029 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-428be20f4dc5b1edeb8be098bb83e029"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like I’m right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled as the edges of her mouth hung open. It was a smile I had never seen before, and one that was unlike her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I entered the library, you first observed me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s exactly what Nietzsche calls the abyss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, when our eyes met, you immediately prepared a smile. But if I made a face that I wouldn&#8217;t normally make, you calmly observed it as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, by observing herself, she managed to observe me. It seems that my initial feeling was not wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was right about everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right, I can see myself objectively and dispassionately. By looking at myself objectively, including the situation at any given time, I am able to find the best solution for how I should act and what kind of expression I should make in each situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that we’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, she nodded her head.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m the same way. I can objectively view myself. I know what I should do in what situation. That&#8217;s why we are the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t say I’m like that, did I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you didn&#8217;t deny it. If what I said was so misguided, you would have denied it right away. I never thought that while going to the library for books… I would stumble into something like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takihana Ruika laughs in delight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re much cooler when you’re calm and focused like right now than earlier when you’re just smiling for service, you know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know that much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately retorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know myself very well. Objectively speaking, I am not that bad looking. I just don&#8217;t feel like bragging about it because it is something my mother gave me, not something I earned through my own efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? It’s a good thing to know yourself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami smiles again in satisfaction at my egotistical response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, let me ask you, Makabe-kun. Do you have your own proper </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?”</span></p>


<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 4</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since then. She has been a frequent visitor to this library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I was her target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly before the library closed, when only a few people were left, she would approach me, whom she considered a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and we would talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first it would be with her “act” on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when we’re alone, far from the public eye, she would drop the “act”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of it all, she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me, knowing what I should do means knowing what people want from me. So I continued to meet those expectations and became the person I am today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When people praised her appearance, she tried to improve herself to be more beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she was praised for her grades, she would excel and study hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If people praised her smile, she would hold onto that smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, the person known as Takinami Ruika is beautiful, an honor student, and always has a gentle smile &#8211; the embodiment of what everyone idolized her to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But then one day, I suddenly thought, if I really had my own proper </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. I wondered if I might be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">empty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This leads me to the question she asked me at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">You. Do you have your own proper </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is the distress she’s currently carrying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, Takinami-senpai also gave an answer to the question she had presented, and began to visit the library more and more as a part of her daily routine. To top it all off, she recently has been coming on to me and asking me to go out with her. I don&#8217;t mind being seen as the same kind, but what&#8217;s so good about someone like me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not interested in going out with anyone at the moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied as if to shake her off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I recognized Takinami Ruika as someone I should be wary of, because she was the &#8220;same kind&#8221; and would be able to read through me. I was afraid of that. Therefore, I stopped using honorifics soon after meeting her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may sound strange and sensual to say, but I, who can calmly and objectively look at myself and prepare appropriate remarks and facial expressions according to the flow of the situation, was rather defenseless against Takinami-senpai. It is precisely because I am wary of her that I decided to face her as my true self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I&#8217;m not good enough for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of man is not gonna be happy with Takinami-senpai? Is that guy aiming for a Hollywood actress or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just not cut out for that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not cut out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai tilted her head and asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. I am not suited for romance. Maybe I am not even suited for friendship as well. I thought she would understand this feeling… Well, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In case you forgot, I just lost my mother. I can&#8217;t afford to devote myself to something like that, something that I could use the time for something else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interrupted her and told her my thoughts.</span></p><div class="zetro-bfeb0f0daee9a961d6a0d6a945affb64 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-bfeb0f0daee9a961d6a0d6a945affb64"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why. I thought now was my chance, when you’re vulnerable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re terrible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily looked up to the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Women who are calculating will be hated, you know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All women are calculating, you know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s refreshing to be told so definitively. It makes me feel more and more that romance is really not cut out for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, you wouldn’t hate me over something like this, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where does her confidence come from?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, in fact, she was right. I rather fancy her two-faced personality. I also can forgive her for her words she said earlier, which could have been a disaster if she said it to any other person than me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makabe Shizuru fancy Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt about that. But I also had my reasons for not wanting a romantic relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> something fatal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chime rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time is 5:55 pm. It is the pre-bell before the main bell at 6:00 p.m. Unless there is a special reason, students must leave school at 6:00 p.m, and the bell indicates to get ready to go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, the library closes at six o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a member of the library committee, it was my job to ask the remaining students to leave the room. Of course, Takinami-senpai, who is right in front of me, is not exempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re about to close, so could you get the h**l out of here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want to go home together?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I have a little more work to do today. Too bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sure that I am the only man in the whole of Akanedai High School who would refuse Takinami-senpai&#8217;s invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I mentioned before, the teacher who sat at the counter while I was gone did nothing. Thanks to that, I still have some small work to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Then, It can’t be helped. I’ll see you next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Takinami-senpai was about to leave, she stopped moving and turned to look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, I know you must be going through a lot after your mother passed away, so if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were much like the words she said before, but not as bland or calculating as then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, she meant it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think this is also Takinami Ruika and that’s quite sly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. If it comes to that, I’ll rely on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied, Takinami smiled with satisfaction and left the library.</span></p><div class="zetro-034d7d78686914ea5e1cd9c13e5a90de zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-034d7d78686914ea5e1cd9c13e5a90de"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then after I saw her off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I deliberately let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is one more person left in this library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A 12th grade female student who was the first to enter the room shortly after it opened. She has been sitting in her seat since then, repeatedly pondering and writing in her notebook, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked up to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called her name, she, Mibu Kanata looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has long, naturally straight black hair that compliments her tall figure, and long, slit eyes. She has a beauty that doesn’t lose out to either Hasumi Shion or Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could have been lined up along with the other two, but thanks to her ice-cold appearance and supernatural demeanor, she is treated as untouchable, even called as the &#8220;Empress&#8221; behind her back. It was the unspoken understanding of this school. That&#8217;s why even Takinami-senpai showed her true face as if there was no other person present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She also calls me by name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s already closing time. Sorry to interrupt your concentration.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As always, you have interesting relationships with others.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai looked up at me as she closed the notebook spread out in front of her. As she did so, she did not respond to my words as a member of the library committee, but said something like that. A slight wry smile appeared at the corners of her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no denying that it is an interesting relationship. After all, the normally ladylike Takinami Ruika shows her true colors here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In fact, it&#8217;s gotten even funnier lately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai&#8217;s curiosity bit just a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you heard of Hasumi Shion-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi? Oh, that girl. Of course, I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Kanata-senpai, who seemed untouchable and a recluse, knew her considering the two years she spent in this school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She became my sister. Thanks to that, I became a nuisance in the Hasumi household.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai quickly narrowed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was thinking about the meaning of what I said. However, if you don&#8217;t know her well, you might have been overwhelmed by her stare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a few seconds later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was your father also the father of that girl?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. That saves me a lot of explaining to do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai was truly intelligent and quick-witted.</span></p><div class="zetro-71b266da7aa6629ff1aa18e62f4f7f19 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-71b266da7aa6629ff1aa18e62f4f7f19"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. It sounds like a joke.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I totally agree with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was a bad kind of joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you say so, are you sure you’re not enjoying it? I mean, you’ve got flowers on both hands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On both hands?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Hasumi Shion and Takinami Ruika would be the flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckle to cover it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It certainly would be, on paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for Hasumi-senpai, the joke is even worse for her, and thanks to that, I have been brilliantly hated by her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Takinami-senpai, as we have seen, has a difficult personality. The fact that she is regarding me as one of her kind and courting me is probably a joyful thing, if one thinks about it in a normal way. But unfortunately, I am not suited for that kind of thing, and I am afraid to jump into their bosom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, if it was a flower in both hands, I would need an additional hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Kanata-senpai with this thought in mind, and saw that the beautiful, solitary empress was putting away her notebooks and pens, seemingly indifferent to me and to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going home, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai soon put everything in her bag, got up from her seat, and walked towards the doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please be careful.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And me, who was seeing her off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time she left, the main bell rang at 6 p.m. She&#8217;s really punctual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And again, I deliberately let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s get the remaining work done quickly. It was good to have things to do. While I&#8217;m doing it, I don&#8217;t have to think about anything else.</span></p>
