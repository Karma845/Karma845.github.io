<h3 style="text-align: center">Prologue</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been a while since I&#8217;ve been to school, and I’m walking together with my classmates through the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been a week, I think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, my friends seemed to be at a loss as to how to interact with me, but after eating lunch together, they have been able to adjust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was now on my way back from the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Mom used to make my lunch, but… this is how it will be from now on, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about the days I&#8217;ll never get back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, It’s Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then one of my classmates spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His voice sounded a little excited and cheerful, as if he had found a good topic of conversation that was not too bland, but still exciting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came back to my senses at the sound of the voice &#8211; or more accurately, the name that was spoken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked in front of me. At the end of the hallway we were walking down, a group of girls from the 12th grade, a year above us, were approaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl stood out among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was short in length and brownish in color. Her eyes were large and beautiful, giving her a lively look. She was wearing make-up like any other highschool girl, but nothing too flashy. And the way she dressed made her look like a sporty girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her, one of my classmates called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, good afternoon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello there, juniors! Are you guys doing great?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied to our greeting in a light tone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to her conspicuous appearance as mentioned above, she has such an outgoing personality that it is impossible for her not to be popular &#8211; as a matter of fact, she is one of the top two famous girls in our Private Akanedai High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name is Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, Hasumi-senpai also noticed me, and when our eyes met, she turned her head away with a snort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I&#8217;m the only one she’s giving this attitude to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it’s not surprising…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the two groups passed each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What would you do if I told you that she and I are siblings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking behind them, I casually said a few words, and the place instantly froze. Everyone stopped and turned to look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay, man?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, one of them opened his mouth and got really worried.</span></p><div class="zetro-d9e8b02f1311b53793e1c8113bedfadb zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d9e8b02f1311b53793e1c8113bedfadb"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I suppose that’s what&#8217;s gonna happen. I lost my mother the other day. I was absent for about a week due to the funeral and other things, and when I came back to school for the first time in a while, this is what I said. No wonder they’ll be worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a joke.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? So it was a joke.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My classmates let out a dry laugh, as if relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was a clear slip up from you, Makabe. Considering how you always make great jokes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I played along with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t want to make the excuse that I wasn&#8217;t feeling well. If I said that, the atmosphere would probably become awkward again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in fact, it was far from a joke. Just the other day, I really became a sibling to that Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai sure is great, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, right? She’s easy to talk to, and she’ll listen carefully when you talk to her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Words were exchanged deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of all this, I looked back on a whim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a matter of course, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group was already far down the corridor, and she wasn’t looking back at us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, It’s definitely Takinami-san for me. She’s calm and beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such an objection, another name came up this time. That voice brought my face to look back at the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is the name of the female student who is the counterpart of Hasumi Shion, who always comes up in this kind of talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep. My vote goes for her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice in agreement immediately sounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika and the previously mentioned Hasumi Shion. It can be said that the two of them split the popularity among the male students of this school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, speak of the devil. Man, I’m in luck today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You serious?! Man, what a luck!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of third year girls were in front once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s group, they seemed to have much calmer demeanor. Apparently, Akanedai High School used to be a school for young ladies until about ten years ago. Maybe they were all like this back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the center of the group was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her black hair was carefully set and she has a beautiful face. She has the calm atmosphere of an honor student and always has a kind smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-senpai, good afternoon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of that, we greeted each of them in a more restrained tone of voice than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon.”</span></p><div class="zetro-86221f88e196da1dc8438c5548eca015 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-86221f88e196da1dc8438c5548eca015"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering what she was like, it was only natural that a greeting with a smile would be returned, but even so, some of them grip their fist out of happiness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for Takinami-senpai, being greeted by a complete stranger was a regular occurrence. The two groups pass each other again without stopping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end, when she passed by me, she gave me a wave that only I could see… with a special little smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I pretended not to notice and looked away. She made a slightly annoyed face when she saw how I ignored her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was such a momentary exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this was the true representation of the relationship between me and Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And going back, the exchange between me and Hasumi Shion earlier was also an accurate representation of our current relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, in these few minutes, there was a microcosm of relationships between me, Takinami Ruika and Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
