<h3 style="text-align: center">Chapter 2 - <b>Average Day Was Well Off The Average Value: Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My days these days begin in a room that I have no clue how to fit in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the morning, when I woke up and got out of bed, I would open the curtains first. The room, exposed to the morning sun shining in through the window, is composed of a desk, bed, closet, and other luxurious black furnishings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the kind of room I was given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Hasumi-san prepared this place in a hurry after I decided to stay at the Hasumi household for a month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, a wealthy family sure is different. Or is it that, as a parent, he was willing to spend money for me? It&#8217;s a little distressing to think that in a month&#8217;s time it will all be for nothing though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it because of taste that I’m not sure how to fit in this room? Or Is it because it’s too much for a poor person like me… Nah, I’m not that financially needy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I changed into my rough loungewear and left the room. After washing my face in the upstairs washroom, I went downstairs and headed to the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, I gave my morning greeting to the girl there― Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was sitting on the sofa, reading a newspaper that was spread out on a glass-topped low table in a stooped position. It was a bit surprising since she doesn’t look like your typical high school girl of today. Perhaps it was the influence of her father, who is a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was still dressed as rough as I was, in shorts and a T-shirt. She is the most stylish female student I know and is quite the apple to the eye. However, she doesn&#8217;t seem to be bothered. She probably doesn&#8217;t care what I thought of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glanced at me and then said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still sounded grumpy as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, you always get up on time, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, she continued talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had assumed that there would be only minimal conversation at most and no small talk between us. I was puzzled at first, but decided to take it as a sign that this was the sociability of an eighteen year old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe the basis of being a trustworthy person is being on time and keeping your word, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked uninterested and expressed her understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a very boring answer, as expected of a member of the library committee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, where’s uncle?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">After smiling at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s words, I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I decided to call Hasumi-san as “uncle.” I thought he might be pleased if I called him &#8220;dad,&#8221; but It was not possible because I hadn’t fully accepted it yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He left early today. This also happens all the time… Come on, let’s hurry up and eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai folds the newspaper and gets up from the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the dining table, breakfast was being prepared. There were several empty plates stacked on top of each other, but I guess it was just getting ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bake the bread.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s instructions flew in. She was now going to make bacon and eggs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after, breakfast was ready.</span></p><div class="zetro-2f231a63e48cee052eab15b731d86d97 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2f231a63e48cee052eab15b731d86d97"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Toast, bacon and eggs, prosciutto salad, and fruit yogurt. That&#8217;s today&#8217;s breakfast menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to Hasumi-san inviting me to his house, I have been free from any chores. Breakfast is ready when I wake up in the morning, and dinner is ready when I return after finishing my classes at school. I only had to clean my room. This would not have been possible if I had stayed alone. I should be grateful to Hasumi-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said that, I can&#8217;t just stay here and do nothing. I need to do something when the time is right. I&#8217;m sure Hasumi-senpai would not be pleased with me cleaning the residence, so if I were to help out, it would probably be with the meal preparation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Itadakimasu.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We immediately started eating together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Hasumi residence is large. The living room is correspondingly spacious, as with the dining area and kitchen. The table set was for four people, but the table looks larger than most tables. Even if four people use it, it wouldn’t feel cramped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until a few years ago, the Hasumi houselond used this table for the three members of the family. Then, it was reduced to only two of them, and a few days ago, it increased to three again..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now it&#8217;s just me and Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were no talks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered why and realized it was because Hasumi-san was not there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up until now, he has been. I can talk normally with Hasumi-san, and Hasumi-senpai is angry with her father, but not so much that she wouldn&#8217;t talk. So at first glance, there was a sense of having dinner together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But without Hasumi-san, this is how it ends up…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Then, why did Hasumi-senpai wait for me to wake up?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a question came to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told my face that she did not recognize me as family. If she had eaten with her father first, she would not have had to share a meal with me, whom she hated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, from now on, in this kind of situation, you can eat together with uncle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, she stopped eating immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you being considerate of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s nothing of that sort…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, it is, but I&#8217;ll say whatever comes to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t care either way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai spilled the beans in a throwaway manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know? I don’t like it. Not being straightforward. One thing is even though they don’t like it, they’re always doing it, only when there’s a reason not to do it is when they happily let it go. If I don&#8217;t like something, I&#8217;ll say so, and if I don&#8217;t want to do something, I won&#8217;t do it in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, since she has decided to have dinner with me even if she doesn&#8217;t like me, she doesn&#8217;t want to look for an excuse not to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Man, I wish a certain two-faced senior would learn a little from her. Although, being that straightforward is certainly admirable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You think it’s weird?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not really.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think I let a bitter smile show on my face, but Hasumi-senpai, who subtly sensed it, glared at me.</span></p><div class="zetro-33bd6458f4aa0899155d19926663fc61 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-33bd6458f4aa0899155d19926663fc61"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then snorted and cut off the conversation there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the meal was almost over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t tell anyone at school that you and I became brothers and sisters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Hasumi-senpai opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t. No one would believe me even if I told them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She agreed in a bland tone. After all, fact is stranger than fiction or something along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I tried it out, but my classmates thought it was just a bad joke. On the other hand, Kanata-senpai, who knew I would never joke about such a thing, did not suspect it. Well, she wouldn&#8217;t go around telling everyone about it anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, just in case. Since, it’s a shame in the family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it was Hasumi-senpai who gave me a warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s not say anything more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">§§§</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing my meal, I returned to my room to get ready for school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, we go to school separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I&#8217;ll leave first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went downstairs and called out to Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was in the kitchen. She had already changed into her uniform and was apparently preparing her lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to leave the house, since there was no response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hey.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was stopped by a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing for lunch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped and came back, and Hasumi-senpai asked me. She was still in the middle of prepping. She did not look at me at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? I’m going to the cafeteria.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then asked another question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mom used to make me lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although that mom is already gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her blunt question, as if I was gouging out a wound that had not yet healed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-6db0efe2caedde0a9d23a5946b174a86 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6db0efe2caedde0a9d23a5946b174a86"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, Hasumi-senpai turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, bring that lunch box next time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said while looking straight at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have one, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if I go back home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Up to this point, I had been answering without knowing her intentions, but I finally had a vague idea. After all, Hasumi-senpai is doing exactly that right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could it be you’re going to make me some?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what I’m trying to say.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She answered bluntly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I always pack enough for myself and dad anyway, so one more won&#8217;t make much difference. But you have to prepare your own lunch box. I won&#8217;t go that far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overwhelmed by Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s one-sided demanding attitude, I faltered in my reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In my case, my mother was sick. I was able to learn many things while visiting her in the hospital. But you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai scratched her head roughly. What a waste, the time to set that hair up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahー, nevermind. Forget about it, I don’t think I can deliver this story well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t seem to have a good handle on what she wants to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go on, get going. If you don&#8217;t go, I can&#8217;t get out either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, excuse me. Well then, I’m off.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the beginning to the end, it was one-sided. I left Hasumi&#8217;s residence as if driven off by her words.</span></p>



<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 2</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch break, after morning classes were finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the other day, I was visiting the cafeteria together with a certain group in my class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Lunch box, huh…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I arrived at the table with my food tray, I looked at it and remembered my conversation with Hasumi-senpai this morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said at that time, there’s one if I go back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But should I really take Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s word for it? She was already in a bad mood because she didn&#8217;t think well of me, so if I took her word for it and offered her my lunch box, she might become even more grumpy…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Nah, I don’t think so.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly reconsider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said it herself, didn&#8217;t she? She said, &#8220;If I don&#8217;t like something, I&#8217;ll say so, and if I don&#8217;t want to do something, I won&#8217;t do it in the first place.” Therefore, she would not make such a proposal if she didn&#8217;t want to do it. If she said she would do something, she would do it responsibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi Shion is a person with no hidden side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this is by no means equal to her being friendly with everyone. If she has someone doesn&#8217;t like, she will act that way all the time. But then again, that&#8217;s just who she is. There must be only a few she hates. And one of those “few” is certainly me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When dealing with me, she&#8217;s always so bitter. Well, that just shows how much she doesn’t think well of me, and her reputation might suffer if she is seen like that at school. But I don&#8217;t think she would be able to be so flexible and treat me the same way she treats other students at school, given her personality. It would be better to be careful not to run into her at school as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After deciding so, my eyes turned to the entrance of the school cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what was going on and immediately knew why. It was a group of several female students with Takinami-senpai being at the center. I caught a familiar face out of the corner of my eye, and my eyes were drawn to it before I even noticed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air in the cafeteria immediately changed a bit with the arrival of Takinami-senpai. My classmates also noticed her and whispered something to each other. Is this the power of Takinami Ruika, one of the twin jewels our Akanedai High School prides in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I idly looked at Takinami-senpai, she also recognized me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked surprised, as if she had not expected to see me here. Then, after saying a word or two to her friends who were with her, she quickly walked over towards us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello there, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A greeting together with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rare. You’re having lunch here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don’t have any other choices.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;” As soon as I replied with a wry smile, Takinami-senpai brought her palm to her mouth and let out a sound in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai apologized as her expression clouded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">C**p. I revealed too much. I should have thought a little more about how I said it. If I had done so, she wouldn’t have given this kind of look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cursed myself for being so careless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Takinami-san. This is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were friends of Takinami-senpai who caught up with her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them asked. Because of her slightly tawny eyes and calm demeanor, she had a kind of strange s*x appeal, although she probably had no intention of doing so.</span></p><div class="zetro-1bc002996f729204de15f28d289dd2bd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1bc002996f729204de15f28d289dd2bd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takajou-san. This is Makabe-kun, a member of the library committee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seniors, pleased to meet you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I greet everyone through a senior called Takajou as Takinami-senpai introduces me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Makabe. You know Takinami-senpai?””</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Naoi-kun!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The situation instantly became chaotic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi Kyouhei approached me from the side of the table. He is the leader of this group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why the seniors were surprised to see him was because in essence, Naoi is the male equivalent of Takinami Ruika and Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has good looks and can study well. Combined with the fact that he is the ace of the handball team and is considered to be the next captain, his reputation as a good-looking guy that can do everything is well deserved. It is no wonder that he is well known even among other grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t expect seniors to know my name. It’s an honor.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi bashfully chuckles, but somewhat proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s natural, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seniors verbally agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, again, unsurprisingly, this group led by Naoi Kyouhei is well known within the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, the top groups of the school caste began to interact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the center of attention was Takinami-senpai and Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because they were aware of each other&#8217;s existence as the Naoi group and Takinami group, but hadn’t had a chance to make contact, they were pretty excited. Takinami-senpai&#8217;s group, who had probably come here with that intention in the first place, went to the vending machine at the right moment to buy something to drink, and then came back here to continue chatting. Some were standing, others were pulling chairs from nearby seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai, who had been watching everyone with a grin, suddenly tugged at the sleeves of my shirt and Takinami-senpai&#8217;s blouse. Perhaps she was aiming to take advantage of the timing that everyone&#8217;s eyes were on Naoi, the only two people who looked back were me and Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the reason Takinami-san often went to the library by herself was because of Makabe-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takako-senpai whispers, covering her mouth with her palm as if she was having a private conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re misunderstanding us.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both denied it at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at you guys getting along.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai looked smug and broke into a happy smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at Takinami-senpai and told her to say something, she just winked back at me. She might be denying it, but her true feelings said otherwise. I knew it, she was an enemy after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun is not just a friend of Naoi-kun’s, but also seems kinda cool.”</span></p><div class="zetro-669081a6fac0e81380ef4b9c4dcd24e9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-669081a6fac0e81380ef4b9c4dcd24e9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heard that? Isn’t that great, Makabe-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai looked at my face and said something like that, and Takinami-senpai immediately got on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Flattery won’t get you anywhere, okay? Do you enjoy teasing underclassmen?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s pretty fun, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two seniors laugh at their own selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since we’re already at it, let’s tease him some more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Takajou-senpai stood right behind where I sat and wrapped her arms around my neck. She hugged me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you and Takinami-san aren&#8217;t like that, then how about me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then whispers in my ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you…? What do you mean…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, don’t play dumb. You already know what I’m talking about. Why don’t we become like that and do something only we can do by becoming like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She was saying it with a giggle, so she’s probably just joking. In fact, she said she was going to tease me earlier. However, due to her strange s*x appeal, it seemed very tempting. Because of the hug, there seemed to be a sweet fragrance in the air, whether it was perfume, shampoo, or just my imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, now. That’s enough. Makabe-kun looks troubled.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Takajou-senpai was soon pulled away by Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I fished something big. I knew it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-it’s nothing like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai&#8217;s focus remained vague, and Takinami-senpai&#8217;s face turned red in denial at the point Takajou-senpai made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, wouldn’t it be counterproductive to do so? It would look like she was desperately trying to hide her obvious fondness for him… although, since it’s Takanami-senpai who’s an expert at hiding her true intention, is she intentionally denying it to convey her true feelings? After all, if she gets serious, she can even lie with a straight face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like to exchange numbers if you don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai asked with her smartphone in hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or would you prefer a social media account with naughty selfies?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately made an unintentionally silly noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you’re joking, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who knows?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I questioned her, however, she just smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No way she’s serious, right? I froze, not knowing how to react.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Makabe, what&#8217;s going on over there? Let me in too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to ask Takinami-senpai for help, Naoi&#8217;s voice came flying from across the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up. I’m in the middle of something.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s more, at a level that might not even be a joke.</span></p><div class="zetro-a7856d4cf0e0f8ddf3e0e99943db32e2 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a7856d4cf0e0f8ddf3e0e99943db32e2"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied back, the place erupted in laughter.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After having lunch in the cafeteria which was more lively than usual, I was on my way to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think, Makabe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">As we walked down the hallway, Naoi suddenly struck up a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Between Hasumi-senpai or Takanami-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this school, whenever guys gather, this topic always comes up. Well, this group in particular seems to bring it up a lot though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, which side should I take?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, this group was somewhat leaning towards Hasumi-senpai. However, one of them had just had a chance to talk with Takinami-senpai and said that he would switch to that side. Well, it doesn’t change that the majority is still on Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For me, it’s Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, even Makabe agrees.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, what’s with that? Isn’t Hasumi-senpai great? She has a fine body.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Naoi who voiced his protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. I agree with you there, as I have more opportunities to see Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s revealing everyday clothes now that I live in the Hasumi household.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi, better choose your words correctly or you’ll get shunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops, I didn’t mean it that way though. I’ll be careful…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pointed it out to him, he smiled as if he was trying to mend the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think Hasumi-senpai is also great. Although, I just can’t go along with her vibe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not saying this because she dislikes me, but because I have been thinking about this even before Hasumi-san showed up, when I was just watching her from afar. That being said, I can understand why many students like her outgoing attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in the case of Takinami Ruika, they couldn’t be more worlds apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My opinion was met with half agreeing with me and the other seeming doubtful. As intended, the topic became even more lively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, you and Takanami-senpai seem to know each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another classmate, who was not Naoi, asked me about it, but since I can’t really bluff my way out, I just affirmed it honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, do you talk to Takanami-senpai a lot?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not as much as you think. We just talk a little when she’s by the counter. That&#8217;s how we know each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, that wasn’t the full story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I wish it had been so. If only she hadn&#8217;t seen through me that day, Takinami-senpai could have still been an ideal upperclassman, and I could talk with her over the counter from time to time&#8230; it could have been a small happy relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about it, we reached the classroom. Just as we were about to run out of topics, I said my goodbye and parted ways with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, I don’t usually belong in this group, but only when I have to get lunch at the cafeteria. We usually part ways around here.</span></p><div class="zetro-b337bc56270ed89902dcae3377e4f359 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-b337bc56270ed89902dcae3377e4f359"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, today, I was stopped by his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi Kyouhei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here, you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think he meant to come over to the “group.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This group, led by Naoi Kyouhei, was unquestionably at the top of the school caste. Although the main members of the group were not as up as Naoi, they all have the status to match him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked behind him and it seemed like Naoi hadn’t noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the members were talking to a group of girls like it was natural. However, some of them were looking at us from a distance. I wonder if it was wariness or hostility that I sensed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I return my attention to Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? I appreciate the offer but I can’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whenever you&#8217;re around, Makabe. It gets lively.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that just a coincidence?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I do it intentionally. It was easy to get the place going if you think and speak a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe. I was surprised when you first asked me to go to the cafeteria with you, but you, you’re pretty good. It&#8217;s not like we have any entrance exams or qualifications to begin with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi then laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exactly. He would probably accept anyone. I can see that even in my case. He has not set up any walls to exclude non-members, and he has that much magnanimity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If there was, I’d be rejected immediately at the screening stage.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I won&#8217;t force you… See ya. ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Naoi Kyouhei turned his back to me. He walked over to where his group were, and the girls&#8217; group and his group had merged to form a larger group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I deliberately let out a sound and looked around the classroom, and found it truly silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a duo of a guy and girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A female student with glasses was reading a book, and a male student sitting in front of her was sitting sideways. They seem to be chatting, but there’s no smile on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube Kagemitsu and Heshikiri Sakura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How do I put it? They have a lot in common with their name. Like about three in common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I approached them. Also, I&#8217;m not intruding. It seems that these two are not dating, and if I belong to any group at all, it’s here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I slightly leaned on the desk next to Karube’s, they both looked up and glanced at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both have surprisingly well-defined profiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, both were lacking in personality.</span></p><div class="zetro-a89c11cfb9da04539a04cc2e88f11318 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a89c11cfb9da04539a04cc2e88f11318"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san, as viewed by the fact that she always read books alone, was quite introverted. Karibe, on the other hand, doesn’t actively try to get involved with others due to his energy-saving nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch, done?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I just got back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, both Karube and Heshikiri-san had finished eating. While our group was having fun and also the case with Takanami-senpai, it seems a lot of time had passed without us noticing. Even Heshikiri-san&#8217;s lunch, which he eats very slowly, was already gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m surprised you can manage to eat with those people.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube coldly looked at Naoi and company, who seemed to be enjoying themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re not bad people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I mentioned earlier, they were not as exclusive or elective as people around them think they were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Facts should be stated accordingly…you mean, Naoi, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I vaguely and bitterly smiled for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is the food at the cafeteria any good? I’ve never been there after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there, Heshikiri-san asked in a low volume voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t ask. I can&#8217;t help but compare it to my mom’s cooking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… I, I’m sorry…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She lowered her voice even more, and she lowered her head in apology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I don’t mind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay… But, are you okay, Makabe-kun? Aren’t you alone?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it will work out, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my mom died, I was left alone as a high school student. It was understandable to be concerned. She really has a kind nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have relatives I can count on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t the whole truth, but I didn’t lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That relative is my father and I only recently found out about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe, I heard you say that you and Hasumi-senpai are now siblings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube jumped into the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a joke. A joke. Man, it even reached your ears? I’m not one to tell jokes that aren’t funny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laughed and covered it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was the guy at Naoi&#8217;s group who said it. He went out of his way to make sure everyone could hear him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alright. Seems like I’m really being treated as an enemy. I was reminded of their stares and Naoi’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I bet that joke is true, right?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p><div class="zetro-c5247149eaa0abdbefb0acb4bf956eed zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c5247149eaa0abdbefb0acb4bf956eed"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Karube repeated his words, without changing his tone in any particular way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Why do you think so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said it yourself. You said it was a joke that&#8217;s not funny. You don&#8217;t make that kind of joke. If it&#8217;s not a joke, it&#8217;s the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-do I…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beside me, Heshikiri-san was also rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell into silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, no one was listening to us. We were not a remarkable group that deserved to be listened to after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, it&#8217;s a well-known story that they are a father-daughter family and that the father is a doctor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that so? I didn&#8217;t know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was a big no-no. Hasumi-senpai just told me this morning, but knowing these two, it would probably be fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you have perceived, it’s true. But, don’t tell anyone. Hasumi-senpai will get mad at me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who would have the time for that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You don&#8217;t seem too busy though. This energy-saving guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san, who was nodding beside me, no offense to her but she doesn&#8217;t seem to have anyone to talk to, even if I have to remind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what’s going on?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was surprised by the conclusion, but could not imagine the process of how it came to be. Well, it was understandable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other words, my father, who I didn’t know, was also Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s father.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I used a definitive proper noun, I lowered the tone of my voice, wary of my surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was born out of an unusual relationship that couldn’t be made public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san was left speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so that kind of thing happens…huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was what came out of her mouth. I think her glasses were also slightly off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only answer that with a wry smile, since it was actually happening to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I suppose it could work out somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s what I’ve been saying.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a nod to Karube&#8217;s ambiguous way of putting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps he guessed that I had been taken in by the Hasumi household. But he didn’t verbalize it. Thanks to this, Heshikiri-san also somehow understood our conversation and just let it slide.</span></p><div class="zetro-cf03291ad3d447cced53cae1d8a24aa9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cf03291ad3d447cced53cae1d8a24aa9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we talked about unimportant things like that, lunch break ended.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along with Takinami senpai, I rode onto a subway in the Gakuentoshi station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, the Seishin-Yamate Municipal Subway Line, although called a subway, runs on the ground level, so it does not look like a subway at all. Looking out the window, you will see a valley spreading out below, and cars that look like toy cars were running on the road there. Incidentally, the next station, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sogoundo-Koen Station</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, used to boast the highest elevation for a subway station in Japan until a few years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The train wasn&#8217;t too crowded, but wasn&#8217;t empty enough for us to sit next to each other &#8211; so we just stood side by side, holding on to the strap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At a quick glance, no students seem to be wearing the same uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t believe you didn’t accept it when I went out of my way to invite you on a date. This is troubling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still going on about that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a glance at Takinami-senpai, who was seriously pondering beside me, and was taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, it was probably a serious situation. Putting aside how many men have approached her in the past, I must be the only person who has ever been asked out by Takinami-senpai and turned her down without a second thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just got a bright idea. I should just go to your house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, don’t be stupid.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What outrageous thing is she talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, think about it. If you won’t go when I invite you, I’ll just have to drag you out myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m never letting you in, you hear?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m currently in the Hasumi family&#8217;s care, and even if I were to return to my original home, I would be the only one there. Letting Takinami Ruika in? What kind of joke is that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly changed into a serious tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you really sure you’re doing alright in your home?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, somehow.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked me with a worried look, to which I replied in a casual tone. But in turn it made me hate myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m always dodging everything… huh.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were many things I can&#8217;t say, but I don&#8217;t want to lie either, so I end up dodging, playing dumb, and acting like I don’t know every time, even to Takinami-senpai, who was seriously concerned about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that’s the case, should I at least give a sincere answer now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be completely honest, I’m all over the place right now. But, I’ll tell you what I can, once things settle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai nodded, being reassured and somewhat happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, It’s my stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself listening to the announcement in the train, indicating that the next stop was Myodani Station, where I should get off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Shizuru, isn&#8217;t your stop at Shin-Nagata Station?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class="zetro-9461e3e27812822edec9e48bb68bb61a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9461e3e27812822edec9e48bb68bb61a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was stupid. I started going to school from the Hasumi house, and naturally, my stop would change as well. I was careless. Should I have made my stop in Shin-Nagata and then gone back to Myodani so that she would not be suspicious?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have some business here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was still somewhat skeptical of my ambiguous reply.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that I ended up lying to her once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Then, I’ll see you tomorrow.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the station shortly after, I said my goodbyes with a bad aftertaste in my mouth and got off the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My name was called and I turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Takinami-senpai, who should have been standing in the middle of the car holding the strap just a moment ago, came near the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She just stared, as if observing me. I was a little afraid that she might see through my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『The door will now close. Please be careful.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, an announcement was heard and the doors were about to close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There we go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senapi jumped out of the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, that was dangerous―?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took one more step and came right in front of me, put her hands behind my neck and brought her face close to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so shocked that I tried to pull my face back. But of course I couldn’t escape. On the contrary, she pulled me closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Takinami-senpai stopped moving suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Did you think I was gonna kiss you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tips of our nose were almost touching each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a nasty mischievous smile. Beyond her, a train was already running with its doors closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. I wouldn’t do such a shameful act. Because, I’m gonna have you kiss me, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you even have a sense of shame in the first place?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was only barely able to say that, and Takinami-senpai brilliantly dismissed my point and smiled innocently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, stay with me and drink coffee while we wait for the next train.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she removed her arms from around my neck, stepped back, and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Again, why?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Distractions.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said it before, right? I can find </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">myself </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">beside you.”</span></p><div class="zetro-0ef74bcda8e628dff71fa69986269dfe zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0ef74bcda8e628dff71fa69986269dfe"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She uttered with the accelerating train in the background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruikai once asked me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400">You. Do you have your own proper </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">』She said―.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also directed at herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had been reading the expectation from the people around her and had been responding to it by becoming Takinami Ruika that everyone idolized her to be, but she was worried that she had no &#8220;self&#8221; and was &#8220;empty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when she met me, she came to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn’t have to play coy with me, being that we’re of the same kind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was what she meant by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Takinami Ruikai’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is found beside Makabe Shizuru.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I idealized her to be beautiful, kind, and always have a gentle smile on her face. But, her coming to my side without any warning and showing me her other side was really annoying &#8211; and also made me a little bit happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, whatever.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied. On the platform, where silence returned after the train had gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, whose is this distraction for? Not for me, I assume.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t matter who it is for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stated in an easygoing manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I figured that was the case, so I quickly made my way to the vending machine.</span></p></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After today&#8217;s class, I opened the library as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deliberately let out a sound with the thought of what I should start working into, and right when someone walked past behind me ― I turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, again, she was first in line. She walked briskly with her long jet-black hair and sat down in her usual seat by the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, it would be nice if she said something at least. But since she usually doesn&#8217;t speak much, it was enough to make an unaccustomed person feel uneasy about their relationship with her. As expected of someone who was known as Empress. I guess she doesn&#8217;t care much about relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the counter again, I saw a small quantity of books piled up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was not the remaining work I had left, so someone, a teacher, must have returned their borrowed book during recess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes this happens. To begin with, I’m the only member of the library committee. So, to be honest, I can&#8217;t really do much. Normally, the library should be open during lunch break and after school, but I can&#8217;t do that much on my own. That is why the library is only open after school, and if I have something to do, I’d just announce that I can’t open it that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of that, the library was not really being used. I try to open the library as much as possible, but I would like to have some manpower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so today&#8217;s work begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Kanata-senpai, no more than ten familiar faces appeared, sometimes students I had never seen before or teachers who had come to the room to do research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of having to explain how to use the library to the students who do not usually come to the library, I became a machine that simply processed check-outs and returns for students and teachers who visited the counter and distributed books to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the wall clock of the library and saw that it was already 30 minutes before closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which means it’s about time…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was muttering alone, I saw a lone female student at the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled as soon as she saw me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Makabe-kun… Oh, what’s wrong? You look dejected, is it about your family?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when she came to the counter, she gave me a concerned look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there were still a few students left at this hour, Takinami-senpai&#8217;s expressions and manner of speaking were really pleasant and honor student-like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, I will respond in a similar manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s nothing of the sort…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you say so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked a little confused as I spoke ambiguously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my face was showing something, it would be because Takinami-senpai&#8217;s behavior was simply too perfect than anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, in reality, aren’t you having a hard time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d be lying if I said I’m not.”</span></p><div class="zetro-1158366388778fc521501d7dc45d79f4 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1158366388778fc521501d7dc45d79f4"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, it was a different kind of hardship from losing a loved one, since it was mainly due to the relationships that were suddenly formed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Next time, let’s go somewhere as a change of pace.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would be nice.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai’s face lit up as she made the suggestion, and I responded with a smile in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?! I’m glad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sound really excited, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? How rude. It’s nothing of the sort. I’m just giving the librarian, who works hard every day, a time to relax.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sullenly retorts, yet with a touch of charm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While this exchange was going on, the remaining students in the library left one by one, before finally, the last one stood up… No, to be precise, Kanata-senpai still remained, but as usual, she was not counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently watched as the last student left at the edge of my vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small shout, Takinami-senpai sat on top of the counter. She moved her face so close to mine that our foreheads were almost touching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;About the date, it better be true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Isn’t it supposed to be just a distraction?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our tone changed at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was no longer ladylike, and my respect for her as an upperclassman vanished. Well, she still retained her elegance, maybe because she was born with it, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, don’t sit on the counter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it’s fine. Besides, it looks erotic, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smiling bewitchingly, Takinami-senpai pulled up the hem of her skirt. It exposed her thighs, which was something you wouldn’t normally see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, look, a knot.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><b>Ah?!</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes almost looked at it, but I held on tight. Don’t wear that kind of stuff in school… I beg you not to show any openings in front of a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, great job not looking. Then, how about this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time she crossed her legs in an extraordinarily large motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want to see it from the front?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai laughed teasingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a good thing that her legs were on the other side of the counter, since viewing it from the front would be very fatal.</span></p><div class="zetro-d12d397827e3298e6b6c8a12b7c93c74 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d12d397827e3298e6b6c8a12b7c93c74"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You joke too much, Takinami-senpai. Please get down from the counter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her politely and firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she shrugged her shoulders and did as she was told, getting off the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It certainly wasn&#8217;t a good behavior, even for a joke. I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she apologized honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But couldn’t you have reacted a little more? I was hoping for a cute reaction, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied, leaning my body against the back of the office chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any other men out there would be happy to oblige, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It wouldn&#8217;t be interesting, and I don&#8217;t want to do it to some random guy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It would be better to do it to you, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a real nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, about our date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was just lip service. Of course I’ll pass.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will just ignore the fact it changed into a date at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, what’s the fun in bringing me out? I’m just one of the many guys out there, and there’s no way I can match Takinami Ruika, who was well known to all the students at this school. Even if we walked together, I would only feel awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that Takinami-senpai and I may be &#8216;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216; as she likes to call it. But, even so, I think it was a whimsical thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered her clearly, Takinami-senapi just shrugged her shoulders and shook her head. She must have known that I would eventually settle on this kind of response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, come to think of it ― that was unexpected. I didn&#8217;t know you’re in Naoi-kun&#8217;s group. You were walking together the other day too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, she then utters, perhaps remembering the incident at lunchtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way. It&#8217;s just a coincidence. I just joined them to go to the cafeteria.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai nodded in understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that surprising for me to be in that group?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surprising is one way of putting it, but… it would be more accurate to say that it doesn’t suit you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laid it down clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I told you this when we first met, but you look better being calm and collected rather than smiling all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You make it sound like I’m a clown just by opening my mouth.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a selfish thing to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She certainly said something like that. Regardless of how I look to those around me, I’m also more comfortable being reserved with Karube and Heshikiri-san than with Naoi&#8217;s group. But on the other hand, I also don&#8217;t dislike myself for being able to play out a character and get along well with such people.</span></p><div class="zetro-0696a3640252713e517453d62692e72f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0696a3640252713e517453d62692e72f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, but if that happens, girls other than me might start to notice you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s absurd. You think I’m that kind of guy?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, then again, I also don’t want you to see you flirting with someone. This is hard.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s not even listening. Go on, worry by yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the pre-bell rang, five minutes before 6:00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, today’s work will soon be over.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, want to go home together?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai suggested so at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment before answering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, how rare. I just assumed you’d say no as usual.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was she surprised when she was the one who invited me? But since I rarely accepted this kind of invitation, it should not be surprising that she was surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did I decide to go home with Takinami-senpai on this day in particular?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, Takinami Ruika is an easy person to talk to, apart from the fact that she’s quite aggressive in her advances. If I knew her as any other person does, I would probably treat her with admiration and respect as my senior with a little nervousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she has a hidden side… unlike Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After getting to know her hidden side, I was able to get along with her front side quite easily. I guess it was fun to have a farce knowing her other side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, I can&#8217;t say that I’m in an environment where I can relax right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lost my one and only mother, and my father, whom I thought I would never see, appeared in my life, and when I was sent to his house, my step-sister did not take kindly to me. Now, one of the times and places where I can have some peace of mind may be the time I spend with Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe that’s why I took her offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with the sudden change?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. I just thought it would be nice once in a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, I&#8217;m not going to be stupidly honest about it with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you were finally going to be my boyfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laid it down clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was true that I fancy Takinami Ruika. However, I had no intention of entering a relationship at the moment. I’m not suited for love after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai put her hands on her hips and let out an exasperated sigh.</span></p><div class="zetro-d0a571e1956793e1d185a507f4cc24fd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d0a571e1956793e1d185a507f4cc24fd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, this book, it’s going back to the shelf, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Yeah, it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pointed at several books that were returned today. Naturally, the return process had already been completed, and I looked inside to make sure there was no damage or writing. All that was left was to return it to the shelves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll put it back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying so, Takinami-senpai walked towards the shelves along with the books in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it was a matter of efficiency. In order to get home early, she’ll help me with my work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sound and went to the last student remaining in the library &#8211; namely, Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no sign that she was using any of the books in the library, and she was still moving her mechanical pencil as if she was writing a letter. It would have been easier if she had brought her laptop instead of doing such an analog thing. She would have been able to write in handwriting later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai, times up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai&#8217;s inorganically neat face turned towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it’s already this late, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was so absorbed in writing that she did not realize it was almost closing time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was watching.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t seem to be affected by Takinami’s provocation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s what you meant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was apparently properly paying attention to things around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s best not to give a reaction when they’re acting like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so… tired of looking at a woman&#8217;s body?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ghg!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I choked up at the unexpected surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have as much appetite as I thought you&#8217;d be if you got bored looking at a woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder what you’re talking about… Now, please leave, we’re closing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was a poor way of avoiding the topic, but I still kept my cover and drove away the beautiful upperclassmen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a demanding library committee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s regular business to ask remaining patrons to leave the room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Kanata-senpai alone, who was still somewhat smiling.</span></p><div class="zetro-7a8f006a3f903c075aca7886579a1622 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7a8f006a3f903c075aca7886579a1622"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was waiting for me at the counter. It seemed that the books had already been organized. It probably didn&#8217;t take long because each location was not too scattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to be talking a lot with her. Are you… close by any chance?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her skeptical gaze on me and asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I wonder?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? What’s with that phrasing? Are you really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if that’s the case, it has nothing to do with you, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seemed that this response was not a good one, and Takinami-senpai tried to further question me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shi―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goodbye, you two.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Kanata-senpai passed by at just the right moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She threw a greeting with a clear tone of voice and walked past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-of course, goodbye, Mibu-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she heard her voice, which was rarely heard. Takinami-senpai was taken aback by her words.</span></p>


<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Act 3</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to the Hasumi residence at exactly 7:00 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I consider the time I spent having coffee with Takinami-senpai on the station platform, I would have been home 15 minutes early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got through the gate and stood on the front porch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a deep breath, I opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have a key to this house. No, to be precise, uncle almost handed it to me once, but I saw the complicated face of Hasumi-senpai from the corner of my eye and I refused it. I said, “I’ll take it once I get used to the house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, what did you expect? For Hasumi-san, it might be a no-brainer since I’m his son, but for Hasumi-senpai who got introduced to her half-brother that came out of nowhere and was as good as a stranger, her reaction was to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, as much as possible, I tried not to go out or come back when they were away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘On that note, it’s quite convenient that I&#8217;m on the library committee.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made a self-deprecating smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since If I open the library, I will naturally come home late like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently go up to the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite strange. When mom was still alive, I would say &#8220;I&#8217;m home&#8221; even if no one was present. But here, I just silently walked up, even if Hasumi-senpai was home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued down the hallway and went into the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked toward the kitchen and saw Hasumi-senpai cooking in the same loungewear clothes and apron she wore in the morning. She was probably preparing dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold, not even a word. And naturally, she didn’t look towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t expect a friendly greeting, and I don&#8217;t think Hasumi-senpai would want to give me either. After reporting that I&#8217;m back, I went up the stairs in the corner of the living room and returned to my room on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the middle of this, I heard Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It’s already done. Once you get changed, come down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around. But the angle seems off, so I can&#8217;t see her. I went down a few steps back. However, Hasumi-senpai was still in the middle of cooking.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied to her back and started to climb the stairs again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crawling into the room, I threw my bag and quickly changed into my regular clothes. I was feeling the need to take a breather, but I quickly left the room. On the way, I washed my hands in the washroom upstairs and went down once I’m done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the kitchen, Hasumi-senpai was in the middle of arranging dishes on the dining table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The menu consists of Kyoto-style grilled pork, braised burdock root and tuna salad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For two people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means it was for me and Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, what about uncle?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-b98d635caccdb00eef27703fcf14ff5f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-b98d635caccdb00eef27703fcf14ff5f"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s on night duty today. He won’t be back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was convinced. That hospital also provided nighttime diagnosis services in addition to emergency services. Hasumi-san, a doctor specializing in cardiovascular medicine, would probably be on duty as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Medical examination at noon, night shifts, then repeat on the next day. What a brutal job, being a doctor.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said it like she was not interested &#8211; maybe because she really wasn&#8217;t amused, or maybe because she was dealing with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s done… Now, why don’t you sit instead of standing there aimlessly?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I talked with Hasumi-senpai, admiring her skill in arranging the dishes on the plate, I realized that all the plates had been set, and I suddenly came to my senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down as I was told, and Hasumi-senpai also sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just like in the morning, the two of us began to eat together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, no small talks. Perhaps that’s why the food was so tasteless, even though it was undoubtedly delicious. This is a good example of how the atmosphere affects the food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, next time you don’t have to wait for me and you can just go ahead and eat ― Ah, and no, I’m not trying to be considerate…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of my talk, Hasumi-senpai turned to me with a grumpy expression, and I immediately changed my choice of words to clear up the misunderstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably thinks I&#8217;m being considerate of her again by saying this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you know, I&#8217;m on the library committee, so I&#8217;m usually gonna be home around this time every day. If you eat along with me, you’ll be eating late too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, so that’s what you meant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I got back from Hasumi-senpai was a reply that sounded more like she had lost interest rather than her being convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry. This is the usual time we eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dinner at 7 p.m was probably later than any average household. Well, maybe a house whose parents are doctors was not probably an average household.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our family also had dinner at the same time too. However, in our case, mom worked at the same hospital as Hasumi-san, but she usually came home earlier than I did when I opened the library, so she had to wait for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re gonna be home any later, call me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I did not have her contact address. So it would be safe to come back straight after closing the library so as not to be late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can’t come back earlier, or any later… Man, it’s getting more and more restrictive.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will ask Hasumi-san for the phone number of this house tomorrow because I don&#8217;t want any unforeseen circumstances to arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been meaning to ask you―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After silently moving her chopsticks for a while, Hasumi-senpai unexpectedly cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who else is on the library committee?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a question.</span></p><div class="zetro-cef04f9484b7de8ba66c46ef48d76e69 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cef04f9484b7de8ba66c46ef48d76e69"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t think she would initiate small talk. Perhaps she was trying to fill in the silence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I’ve only seen you… Well, I’ve only been there a few times, so maybe it’s just bad timing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just me alone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered her question, she sounded so surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just me alone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard you… Eh? What’s up with that? You’re alone?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do you mean you could hear me when you just asked for confirmation? I thought you couldn’t hear me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had seniors until last year, but after they graduated, I’m the only one left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was because it was a modest and unpopular committee to begin with. It would have been nice if someone new had joined this year, but as you can see, it was unfortunate. Maybe it was because committees have the same opportunities to recruit new members as they do in clubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that a lot of work?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I suppose. The school is also aware, so they don’t make me do this and that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess they were just thankful that it was being opened. That’s expected, at a school where almost all students choose to go on to college, it would be unbecoming for the library to remain unopened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it hard work? Why continue doing it? What, do you enjoy it? Do you like books?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t particularly like books. I&#8217;m also not the kind of person who would be happy if I were to be surrounded by books.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai tilted her head, looking really puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I had to say, it was probably because there are people who are annoyed when the library is not open and people who are happy when it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two women&#8217;s faces immediately come to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Hasumi-senpai threw her back against the backrest, sounding both impressed and dismayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t imagine doing that. I can’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess that&#8217;s true for some people. It&#8217;s not even about competing with others. There are no records, no evaluations, no merit to it. The best you get is a line to your unofficial report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s merely a service activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not everyone, but there will be those who are suited for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would you even think of doing something like that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai again moved her body away from the backrest, this time leaning forward while peering for an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I was in middle school, there was a lecture at a nearby university.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A lecture?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p><div class="zetro-4ceaba88cb0f1a5b244174c6b67cf1fe zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4ceaba88cb0f1a5b244174c6b67cf1fe"></div>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. From a librarian in the United States.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I happened to hear about the lecture and went to listen to it on a whim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lecture was about how Japan&#8217;s library administration was lagging behind and had gone in the wrong direction. Libraries were not places to borrow books, but to obtain information. Such was the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, the audience was small, and I was struck by his chuckle as he said, &#8220;Look at how little interest there is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I could not understand the attraction of libraries. What attracted him to libraries and why did he cross the ocean to become a librarian in the U.S? But I felt that it was wrong to dismiss him just because I didn&#8217;t understand it. So I decided to give it a try and joined the library committee when I entered high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did anything good come out of trying?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular at the moment.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing at the podium, he also said that librarianship is the job of bringing books and people together. Unfortunately, neither me nor the high school library committee members can do such a big job. At the moment, I’m not confident whether I could fulfill the role of a librarian as he had described it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for myself, I met people, not books. It could be Takinami Ruika or someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you, Hasumi-senpai? Club activities, committees, things like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought we’re in that kind of atmosphere right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was probably the first time since I came to this house that we are having an honest conversation. What I see in front of me now is close to the Hasumi-senpai I see at school. So now I wanted to continue the conversation a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But apparently that was a mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? I was on track and field until 8th grade.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Until 8th grade?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kind of a half-baked time to quit. Usually, students quit in preparation for high school entrance exams, which can be as early as the summer of 9th grade, and as late as the fall of the same grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was when the expression disappeared from Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mother was hospitalized for an illness and died in less than six months and ― I lost all motivation to do anything. By the time I realized I couldn&#8217;t go on like this, it was too late. I couldn&#8217;t do the same training routine as before, and my record was not going to come back. So I knew I had to stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps remembering her late mother, Hasumi-senpai told only the truth and then fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, a silent meal ensued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, she opened her mouth again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t look at me. Her gaze remains fixed on her plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think mom died, not knowing anything about you, or dad’s infidelity?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I was mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she remembered was not her mother. But she remembered that we don’t have a great relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai must have been caught off guard. She had asked a question on a whim to fill the silence and had unexpectedly received an interesting answer, which made her a bit talkative. But then she came back to her senses and thought I was proof of her father’s betrayal.</span></p><div class="zetro-d51b3ea82e855bc6671151c47a70b0eb zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d51b3ea82e855bc6671151c47a70b0eb"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry but I have no clue… You’ll probably have to ask uncle about that matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only Hasumi-san knows the answer to that question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose. Next time, I’ll ask him.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably doesn’t really have the intention of doing so, so she simply dodged the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s natural. It was normal to hesitate when Hasumi-san might give an unwanted answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, we finished our meal without exchanging any more words.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
    
    
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hands of the clock point to 10 o’clock in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sitting on the couch in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I came to the Hasumi residence, I sometimes come out to the living room like this. It would be quite creepy if I were to stay confined in my room so as not to see Hasumi-senpai. However, she probably would be annoyed if I stayed here all the time, so I kept it in moderation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a noisy day…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I murmured with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, what am I doing here? Sometimes I read books or textbooks, sometimes I play on my smartphone and sometimes I brazenly watch TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now &#8211; I was reflecting on the day that was today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the fact that my day started and ended at this mansion was a big change in itself, but because I made a point to eat lunch with Naoi Kyouhei&#8217;s group at school, I also had the opportunity to come into contact with Takinami Ruika’s friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was way above the value of my average day. Perhaps this will become the norm from now on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was imagining a scary vision of the future, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s voice came flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted around in my seat on the couch and looked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;?!?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I thought my heart would stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There she was standing &#8211; probably after taking a bath. She was only wearing a bath towel wrapped around her naked body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bath towel covering her body was not very large, and her slender, healthy legs were visible at the base of the towel. And yet, the top edge of the towel was also almost halfway up her chest, and perhaps because the towel was tightly wrapped around her, she had a deep cleavage. I had always thought she had a good style, but this showed me how great it really was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you dressed like that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was careless since dad wasn’t around. I forgot you’re here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I hurriedly turned away, Hasumi-senpai just casually answered me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had been caught off guard, she could have just walked through behind me without saying a word and returned to her room as quickly as possible. Why bother calling me out? But in fact, she didn’t seem bothered about being seen. It seems that I’m being treated as a stranger, let alone a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know,”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if she would go upstairs while I was looking the other way, but she spoke to me, as if she had something to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t look half-bad when you’re quiet and in thought. I passed by you before in the hallway at school, but you look much better earlier than being a goofball at school.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Coincidentally, I was just told something similar today by Takinami-senpai. But in her case, she has been saying it for a long time. If I were talking to Takinami-senpai right now, I would have said something arrogant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, yeah. About 30% better.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“30% better?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It means you finally have a face worth looking at.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by that!? That’s uncalled for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I protested, Hasumi laughed at me. Perhaps it was because she had taken a bath, but she was in a good mood. She was like that at dinner, and now she was like this. Her attitude was unpredictable. I was confused.</span></p><div class="zetro-0f5848e120f183ac8a67874435aa046b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0f5848e120f183ac8a67874435aa046b"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, please go upstairs and put on some clothes. You&#8217;ll catch a cold.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drove her away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t underestimate a former athlete, I wouldn’t catch a cold over something like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s poison to my eyes, so please.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you a guy? You’re probably used to seeing this kind of stuff in magazines or on the internet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, the gravure pages of manga magazines were filled with swimsuit photos of idols, and if you scour the Internet, you can dig up plenty of more extreme ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s a huge difference between a page or a display and a real person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, sure. I understand, adolescent young man.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai answered while shrugging her shoulders, and with a clatter of her slippers, she went upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually I heard the door to her room open and close again, and I let out a deep sigh. I relaxed my body and let it sink onto the couch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even at the end of the day, this is what I get…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rested my head on the back of the sofa and looked up to the sky as I lamented about my far-from-average life.</span></p>
