<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Lonesome Strawberry Donut</h3>

<p>"Good morning, boyfriend! Hey, what were you doing just now? After class, we have gym, but if I wear my gym clothes, it'll be too embarrassing. But if I don't wear them, it'll be like art class. Hey, do you want to see it? Boyfriend! I'll show it to you next time we're alone! And also..."</p><p>In the classroom in the morning.</p><p>Rosy is sitting at my desk. She talks to me nonstop with her legs crossed.</p><p>Although I racked my brain trying to figure out how this had happened, I couldn't think of an adequate response.</p><p>However, there was one thing I was sure of. Rosy is actually a student in the secondary education section of this school.</p><p>She didn't just suddenly appear, but has been in another building all along. I just didn't know it before.</p><p>Of course, this can't be a reason for Rosy to come to the high school division and take over my desk.</p><p>"Why did you come to this place...?"</p><p>"Because Rosy didn't know the boyfriend's contact information. If she wanted to talk to you, she could only come to the classroom, right?"</p><p>"I have no relationship with you."</p><p>"We have a relationship. Didn't you protect Rosy from Ioka?"</p><p>"That was ..... anyone would have done the same thing."</p><p>"Do you think Rosy is better than Ioka? Ioka said so earlier."</p><p>"No, that's not so."</p><p>"Is that so? Then, why was Ioka so angry?"</p><p>"Stop talking about it. This topic is over..."</p><p>"Can we talk about it later then?"</p><p>"That's not what I meant!"</p><p>"I'll come get you after school! But Rosy gets out of school earlier - forget it, I'll wait for you, boyfriend!"</p><p>She took off like a storm, leaving behind only a ruined me and Miu's look in the mud.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Aruha. They were talking so loud, I heard everything."</p><p>"Hmm... It's not Miu's fault..."</p><p>"Honestly, what's going on?"</p><p>"Even I don't know."</p><p>"Do you feel like Eric Clapton and George Harrison? Oh, needless to say, in this situation Aruha is Layla."</p><p>"You're making it even more confusing."</p><p>"By the way, how is Ioka-chan?"</p><p>"Well... it's a long story..."</p><p>After that, I didn't see Ioka again and our contact was completely cut off.</p><p>Ideally, I would have been the one to initiate contact. But I didn't know what to say.</p><p>I betrayed Ioka.</p><p>And I completed my duties as an exorcist in the worst possible way.</p><p>The devil was exorcised. But as a price, I lost my relationship with Ioka forever.</p><p>No, this realization is too self-righteous.</p><p>This is not the price of exorcising the devil.</p><p>It's simply because I covered up the truth and delayed the problem for my own good.</p><p>So, since then, Rosy hasn't stopped bothering me.</p><p>Still, I don't want to see this as her replacing Ioka. I don't know what I am to her, I'm clearly not her exorcist or anything like that.</p><p>Yes, I am Ioka's exorcist. That's right, it's just a convenient relationship that is neither good nor bad. Since the mission is completed, I should return to my peaceful daily life as before.</p><p>That's what I wanted before.</p><p>... It should have been like that.</p><p>But, Rosy--no, myself, I don't let things go back to the way they were.</p><p>Is it the intense heat that's twisting my heart?</p><p>On the other side of the window, drizzle, no matter how strong the flame seems, it will be extinguished.</p><p>***</p><p>After class, Rosy actually showed up and dragged me to Mister Donuts.</p><p>Even though I was carrying a tray in my hand, my head was dizzy and I just stood there without choosing anything. Rosy paid no attention to me and hummed a tune I had never heard before as she piled up mountains of donuts. The bright yellow raincoat she wore contrasted sharply with the pink donuts.</p><p>"You really like these things, huh?"</p><p>I couldn't think of anything else to say, so all that was left for me to do was react to the scene before me.</p><p>"Because it's similar to Dum Dum donuts."</p><p>"Gundam?"</p><p>"Dum Dum. It's a donut store in London, I really like it. My father sometimes buys it for me to take home. But Rosy likes Japanese doughnuts better. Because they are cheap and tasty."</p><p>After saying all this, she finally noticed that my tray was still empty.</p><p>"What's the matter, you've never been here before? This one is really good. Here, have some."</p><p>After speaking, she put a strawberry donut on my tray and quickly went to pay and secure a seat. I stopped thinking and grabbed the tray with the same donut as Rosy's and headed for the cashier.</p><p>When I sat down across from her, Rosy, who had taken off her trench coat and sat down on the couch, patted the seat next to her. Although it seemed unnatural to sit together on a four-seater sofa, I didn't have the strength to resist and sat down next to her as she had instructed.</p><p>"It's raining a lot. Rosy hates rain in Japan. It's too intense."</p><p>She looked out the window and took a big bite of her donut, the pink crumbs falling onto the plate.</p>

<p>Hearing her words, I finally had an idea of Rosy's origin.</p><p>"Rosy is from England?"</p><p>"Yes. Dad's still in England. Merlin? Morgan? Something like that, it's a job I don't understand. Rosy lives with Mom, but Mom's busy and never home."</p><p>"I see. So you came to Japan with your mother?"</p><p>"No, it's just the opposite. Rosy has two older brothers, two older sisters, they all live in Winchester. But, Rosy's a little too straightforward, isn't she?"</p><p>"I can't deny that."</p><p>"To be honest, I should have gotten along better with the people around me, but I couldn't do that, and Dad was always nagging me. So Mom brought me to Japan."</p><p>"I see..."</p><p>Since proper nouns are pronounced in English, I didn't understand some parts. Although I don't know the details, it seems that she came to Japan with her mother. She is good at Japanese, maybe because of her mother's influence? In any case, it sounds very harsh.</p><p>Perhaps because I showed a worried expression, Rosy responded first.</p><p>"But it's nothing. Mom and Dad's relationship was not good from the beginning, and Mom also has boyfriend in Japan. Just like Rosy wanted to come to Japan. Those kids at school are all brats, they're the ones I hate the most."</p><p>Rosy said indifferently, but in general, it seems that things are complicated. Anyway, Rosy's appearance is very striking, and with her personality, it will probably be hard to fit in at school.</p><p>Although it was during the conversation, the donuts kept disappearing one by one.</p><p>Seeing this, I couldn't help but think of someone.</p><p>"Can I ask a rude question, you won't get fat from eating like this?"</p><p>"Eh, why?"</p><p>"Well, this stuff seems to have a lot of calories."</p><p>"Ah, some people get fat just from eating. I've heard of things like that."</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>Although I don't know what counts as a so-called modeling talent.</p><p>But if you have a body that doesn't get fat from eating, it's certainly one of the talents.</p><p>"We were just talking about Rosy."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"I thought the boyfriend came here to find out about Ioka, and that's why he came with me."</p><p>The words spoken so matter-of-factly, cut me like a sharp blade.</p><p>"Why is everyone talking about me and the Ioka affair like that?"</p><p>The donut escaped Rosy's mouth.</p><p>"Boyfriend, are you serious? You can tell just by looking at him. I think everyone gets it."</p><p>"Get what?"</p><p>She sighed and picked up the donut crumbs from the tray and popped it into her mouth.</p><p>"Hmm... how so? But if everything went well, Rosy might be okay too. By the way, what's going on, is there a play?"</p><p>"No play. Heart stop."</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>"Nothing. Sorry. How's Ioka?"</p><p>I asked the question as she said, and resigned myself.</p><p>"Hmm... I'm not too sure. I think she's getting ready for the show."</p><p>In the end, Rosy raised no further objections and apologized to the designer, so Ioka will be the one to appear in the fashion show.</p><p>That had been her wish for a long time</p><p>"Is that okay with Rosy?"</p><p>She smiled with a mouthful of donuts.</p><p>"Rosy took a little look at Ioka's appearance .... I can't win against her at all. I'm afraid, if that designer knew and still chose Ioka, then she's really that good."</p><p>Hearing this, my feelings became somewhat complicated.</p><p>Deep down, I wondered if my existence had helped her at all, but that was just my self-centered wishful thinking. My role was over and she no longer needed me.</p><p>"Hey. Rosy's already said so much. Boyfriend, can you tell me too?"</p><p>She leaned closer to me, our thighs touching.</p><p>"Why was Ioka on fire?"</p><p>After all, Rosy was also involved in the danger. I think she has a right to know what it's all about.</p><p>I told Rosy the most basic information.</p><p>After listening to me, Rosy nodded her head repeatedly.</p><p>"I see. So it's a devil..."</p><p>"Do you believe me?"</p><p>She readily accepted my words, which surprised me. It should have sounded like a far-fetched and absurd story. Even Ioka, the person involved, was initially skeptical about it.</p><p>"Onii-chan was having a very hard time for a while. Although he went to the hospital many times, it didn't help, so he went to church. At first, Dad didn't believe it, but the situation improved quickly. That's why I thought it might be true."</p><p>"Wait. So, your brother was possessed by a devil, and then an exorcist exorcised the devil?"</p><p>"Yeah, something like that?"</p><p>While saying this, I remembered that Sai-san is now in England. I didn't expect her to be related there as well.</p><p>"But aren't devils a supernatural phenomenon? That's what church people say."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I suppose so...?"</p><p>Although she sounds too general, she's not entirely wrong.</p><p>"So, Rosy decided not to lie to herself. She gets angry when she's angry and cries when she's sad. But she was criticized by other people for not being polite. I want to be like that too, but it's probably best not to think about it too much. After all, devils are very scary."</p><p>I was surprised. Although I don't know what church she is or if she understands devils the same way Sai-san does, but overall, the reasoning seems to be the same.</p><p>"So, it's kind of like being a bad girl ..... But, Rosy really felt sorry for Ioka and apologized to her."</p><p>After saying that, she touched her slightly reddened neck.</p><p>If it wasn't for the fact that Rosy wanted to defeat Ioka using such a violent method, she almost wouldn't have been turned into a barbecue by Ioka. In that sense, it could be said that she got what she deserved.</p><p>"I hope the burns don't leave scars."</p><p>"It shouldn't be a problem with this level of burns. But..."</p><p>"But?"</p><p>Rosy looked at me seriously.</p><p>"If it wasn't for you saving me, Rosy wouldn't be able to modelling anymore. So, thank you."</p><p>I don't think it's necessary for me to say you're welcome. Rosy's actions were certainly not a good thing.</p><p>"So, what are you planning to do, boyfriend?"</p><p>By the time I noticed, Rosy had already finished her donut. She asked me as she wiped her mouth with a handkerchief. She looked coarse but her actions were surprisingly elegant, giving off a sense of good manners.</p><p>"I don't have any plans. The devil has already been exorcised. After that, as long as Ioka can perform in the fashion show and show off her modeling skills, it's fine with me. And also..."</p><p>"Also?"</p><p>"Don't call me boyfriend again. I'm not. I simply played the role of exorcist."</p><p>"Hmm...."</p><p>Rosy put her fingers to her lips and thought for a moment.</p><p>"Hey, so the boyfriend isn't Ioka's boyfriend, is he?"</p><p>"Haven't I already said that many times?"</p><p>"Then, would you like to be my boyfriend?"</p><p>"Haaaa?"</p><p>Hearing this, I couldn't help but let out a strange noise.</p><p>"It's not bad to be my boyfriend."</p><p>Rosy tugged on my sleeve.</p><p>"Wait, you're still in high school, right?"</p><p>"What? So, if Ioka is in high school, wouldn't you like it?"</p><p>"Ioka is Ioka, it has nothing to do with age... no, it's not even a matter of whether I like her or not."</p><p>"Come on, you're trying so hard for a girl you don't like? It's strange, isn't it?"</p><p>"That, we'll leave it for now. After all, I don't know anything about Rosy, and Rosy doesn't know anything about me either, right?"</p><p>"Then, you know everything about Ioka?"</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>I don't know her at all. I don't even know what she's doing now.</p><p>Rosy sensed my inner hesitation and broke through.</p><p>"It's all right. I got dumped anyway. Let's try to be boyfriend and girlfriend. I really like you, you know? You listen to me, you don't put me down, you're mature and you saved me."</p><p>I was going to say, isn't that a fact? But I kept my mouth shut. Maybe it's the opposite. She's never been in a relationship like this. How does she feel now, staying here, staying in Japan?</p><p>"The boyfriend is happy too, isn't he? After all, Rosy is so cute."</p><p>"I can't do something so irresponsible."</p><p>"I'll tell you everything about Rosy from now on. If it doesn't work out, we'll break up. The Japanese take these things too seriously. It's not that big a deal to be irresponsible."</p><p>Rosy leaned against me. Because she was taller, my head was pressed against Rosy's cheek.</p><p>"Let me think about it."</p><p>"Great!"</p><p>"No! What I meant a moment ago was ... a polite way of refusing..."</p><p>"What is 'enkiyoku'?"</p><p>"Umm, a roundabout way of speaking?"</p><p>"Huh? What the hell? I don't get it."</p><p>I had no answer. But Rosy continued quietly.</p><p>"But Rosy's not disappointed or anything. You can't fully understand everyone's feelings."</p><p>Rosy is a strange child. Sometimes she seems like a child, sometimes she seems like an adult.</p><p>"I can't be that understanding."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"It's hard to explain it to you. It means that Rosy, even though she's in high school, is pretty amazing."</p><p>"You say it has nothing to do with age. The boyfriend just said it, Ioka is Ioka. So Rosy is Rosy."</p><p>"Hmm... Yes, maybe..."</p><p>I'm really impressed by her. It seems like I'm the one who doesn't understand.</p><p>Just when I was feeling impressed by her words, she suddenly stood up.</p><p>"But, Rosy is very good. The groom won't be at a disadvantage. And I will become even more amazing later on. I understand it myself. Even though I lost to Ioka this time, there's still a chance. I won't stop here."</p><p>I was overwhelmed by her determined figure.</p><p>Not by her height.</p><p>But by her confidence.</p><p>Being in this place now and soon having something to be proud of.</p><p>It's something I don't have.</p><p>And it must be the same for Ioka.</p><p>"Ah, I forgot about this, here."</p><p>She handed me a piece of paper. I took it without thinking and only then did I understand its meaning.</p><p>"Do you want to come? You can come in with this."</p><p>"Wait, I have no intention of going."</p><p>"Rosy can't give this to you by herself. Shimizu-san wants you to come too."</p><p>Simultaneously upon hearing that name, that deep voice rings in my mind.</p><p>(Seeing my face will probably put her at ease.)</p><p>But I am not a factor that can be part of Ioka's strength.</p><p>I can no longer fulfill that expectation.</p><p>"Well then, Rosy's leaving. Will you come, boyfriend?"</p><p>"No, I..."</p><p>"Oh, I wanted to try that. That umbrella!"</p><p>"Don't you have a raincoat?"</p><p>"You really don't understand. It's better to be together. Forget it. Do something better next time. That's it! Bye!"</p><p>After handing me the ticket, Rosy put on her raincoat and walked alone in the rain.</p><p>The sound of the rain splashed along with her footsteps, as if it was her territory even in the rain.</p><p>As I watched her back, I suddenly thought.</p><p>(If only I had to follow her like this.)</p><p>(If I were to become her boyfriend.)</p><p>(Wouldn't I have to worry anymore?)</p><p>(Could I forget about Ioka?)</p><p>But I know it's not that simple.</p><p>There's still an untouched donut and a ticket on the table.</p>
