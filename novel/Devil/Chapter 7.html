<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Garbage, Towel, Bed</h3>

<p>"Cough, cough."</p><p>"Ioka! Thank God..."</p><p>After dragging Ioka under the bridge, she soon opened her eyes while coughing nonstop.</p><p>"Ah. You're here, Aruha! Sorry, I..."</p><p>"It's okay, it's okay."</p><p>I should have said something more insightful, but I couldn't think of anything.</p><p>I felt like my brain had been drenched in water and I couldn't think. Still, I kept rubbing her back as she continued to sob.</p><p>Soon, when she calmed down, I apologized.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I acted recklessly. I only thought of that method at the time."</p><p>"No, it's my fault ..... the devil..."</p><p>Ioka hugged herself.</p><p>It was undoubtedly the biggest flame so far. The devil ignited it at lightning speed. Although there wasn't much combustible material on the bridge, there was still a chance that the fire could spread to other places and start a fire. And if we left it there, someone would eventually notice and call the fire department. Although Rosy was too shocked to take pictures, if a crowd gathered, someone would take a picture and spread it around. We had to consider this possibility.</p><p>That's why I jumped into the river.</p><p>I don't know how deep the river was. I knew there was a possibility of hitting the bottom and injuring myself. But I would rather take that risk than let it happen to her.</p><p>Fortunately, we were safe.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>"I think so."</p><p>Ioka checked her body and answered. I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>"That's great..."</p><p>It seemed that, for the time being, she wouldn't be able to start flames again.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>She let out a cry and seemed to realize something. She patted her hair with her hand.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"The hairpin...!"</p><p>Ioka looked around after saying that. I immediately understood what she meant.</p><p>The star hairpin she was wearing had disappeared from her hair.</p><p>"I'm going to look for it!"</p><p>I looked around, but it was too dark to see. I tried to go back to the river, but it was too dark to see either, even the hand I had stuck in the water.</p><p>Although my body was already soaked, it was the first time I felt how cold the river water was.</p><p>"Aruha, that's enough."</p><p>"But it's something very important, right?"</p><p>"... There's nothing we can do about it. Compared to that..."</p><p>Ioka looked at her own body after saying that. I followed her gaze and noticed something I shouldn't have. I quickly looked away.</p><p>We were both in a pitiful state. We were not only soaked, but also covered in dirt from something unknown. We were lucky our phones were waterproof.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"M-My house is nearby."</p><p>"Oh..."</p><p>If we walked the streets like this, we would definitely scare people. Someone might even call the police. Her house was definitely a good place to go.</p><p>"But, you have to make me a promise."</p><p>"Promise?"</p><p>"Please, just don't say anything."</p><p>Although I was confused, she had already gotten up and started walking, so I followed her.</p><p>I understood her request for me not to say anything. After all, from Ioka's perspective, it was natural for her to be wary of a man entering her room.</p><p>But what did "don't say anything" mean?</p><p>My clothes clung to my body, and I found it hard to think.</p><p>My thoughts flowed with the trickle of water, like water that can't be picked up again.</p><p>***</p><p>"We arrived."</p><p>After about five minutes walking with Ioka, we arrived at the entrance of a high-class apartment building. The lobby looked like that of a hotel. Ioka deftly inserted the key into the automatic lock and opened the door.</p><p>In this situation, I couldn't help but feel nervous. My body was shivering, not because of the cold. After all, it was my first time going to a girl's house, and it was Ioka's house.</p><p>But now it was an emergency. I was not to do anything unnecessary. I should just borrow a towel at the entrance and go home. After all, she had asked me not to say anything earlier, and now it was late at night.</p><p>As we entered one of the elevators, lined up side by side, Ioka pressed the button for the tenth floor.</p><p>The square platform accelerated smoothly and I felt my own weight.</p><p>Ioka wore a contemplative expression and stared at the floor indicator. Droplets of water fell rhythmically from the ends of her wet hair.</p><p>The orange light indicated that we had reached the 10th floor, and so we walked down the silent corridor. Then Ioka stopped in front of room 1011, turned the key and opened the door.</p><p>"Please come in."</p><p>"Excuse my intrusion."</p><p>As soon as I entered the room, the automatic lights came on and illuminated the entrance.</p><p>"Oh, wow..."</p><p>Then, the sight before me made me gasp in awe. The interior was well decorated and elegant, and had an ambiance that would be fit for a fashion model.</p><p>However, it wasn't what it looked like. The room was cluttered with large, tightly closed white plastic bags. They were garbage bags. They were piled up in the hallway leading to the living room.</p><p>Ioka gave me a look so I wouldn't say anything.</p><p>"I'm sorry. I'll keep quiet."</p><p>"Stay here for the time being."</p><p>After kicking off her shoes, she hurried into the room. I stood in my place, staring blankly, as she ran around the room with the echo of her wet footsteps.</p><p>After a while, she returned and opened a door in the hallway, gesturing for me to enter.</p><p>"Anyway, go take a shower first."</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>I couldn't help but make a noise.</p><p>"Don't worry, the bathtub is very clean. I set a timer to heat the water since I wanted to take a shower when I got home."</p><p>"Isn't that the problem though?"</p><p>"You can't stay wet like that. I'll take a shower later, too."</p><p>"Oh, okay?"</p><p>"You're being vulgar. And I meant after you're done showering."</p><p>"What I'm saying, is that the problem isn't here..."</p><p>"Stop talking nonsense! Hurry up! Take off your shoes! Then I'll clean up the hallway."</p><p>I obeyed her even though I had more to say, took off my wet shoes and walked down the hallway in my wet socks.</p><p>I'm not sure if she was in a hurry or just didn't want me to do anything unnecessary, but she pushed me into the dressing room and closed the door behind me. Warm light came from the frosted glass door on the other side.</p><p>As I thought this, the door creaked open and Ioka poked her head in.</p><p>"H-Huh?!"</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>"Don't avert your eyes, it's embarrassing like that. When you were putting on your suit, you didn't seem to mind."</p><p>As she averted her gaze, Ioka held out her hands.</p><p>"It's different when I'm at home ..... Anyway, the towel is in that storage box over there. As for the clothes, put this on for now. It's mine."</p><p>"Uhh..."</p><p>"Put the clothes you take off in the washing machine. I'll wash them later."</p><p>After saying that, she closed the door with a thud.</p><p>Listening to the sound of her footsteps and rustling as she did something inside, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. After all, she suddenly brought me into her house and I had to clean up. This was out of the question. I decided to go into the bathroom with a sigh.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, I borrowed the shampoo and washed my hair and body with the soap in the shower. When I finished showering, my whole body emitted Ioka's fragrance.</p><p>I thought about the devil and the flames, Ioka's wishes, Rosy and the photos, and the organization of the fashion show. All these things I have to consider were piling up like a mountain, but it seemed that all these thoughts vanished with the ventilation.</p><p>In short, it became clear why Ioka had not let me approach her house earlier. She was not staying at home, but practicing walking on the rooftop of the school.</p><p>But that's not what I should be considering. I should be thinking about Ioka and the devil. The fire is fulfilling her wishes. In other words, the devil must be achieving her goals by spitting fire.</p><p>The devil against - no, Ioka had a clear hostility toward Rosy, who prevented her from performing in fashion shows. To Ioka's desire, she herself paid no attention, or rather, didn't want to admit it. In the end I came to this conclusion.</p><p>Her wish is.....</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Suddenly, a voice interrupted my thoughts. I could vaguely see a figure on the other side of the frosted glass door.</p><p>"Is everything all right? I haven't heard anything from your side."</p><p>"I'm fine, I didn't drown..."</p><p>"Is that so? That's good."</p><p>After listening for a while to confirm that I had left the locker room, I came out of the bathroom. I dried my body with a towel and looked around. Although I could probably find a hair dryer somewhere, I was too embarrassed to look through her things, so I just used the towel to dry my hair. Since I don't have very long hair, it dried right away.</p><p>The clothes she gave me to wear were summer clothes: a large T-shirt and shorts. I was surprised at the size of the shorts, which were very short and left my thighs exposed. And I noticed that the shorts were women's shorts. I also noticed that my underwear was wet. I couldn't put them back on after bathing, though.</p><p>I put on my clothes and peeked into the living room, but there was no movement. I was about to open the door, but decided to knock instead.</p><p>As soon as I knocked, Ioka poked her head in, her face tense, and invited me in.</p><p>She had changed into her home clothes and was drying her hair with a towel. She was wearing almost the same clothes as I was. But the T-shirt was falling down, exposing her delicate shoulders. From her bare thigh to her toes, everything was dazzling, and I had to consciously look up.</p><p>"Well, the place is a mess, but the bed is empty, so sit here, please."</p><p>Ioka pressed me apologetically, she looked nervous and didn't even notice my strange look.</p><p>The living room was in the same state as the hallway, with a large number of garbage bags piled up. Still, it looked like the bed area had been tidied up a bit, leaving a small space around the bed.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"Nothing, it's just..."</p><p>Although I had a lot to say, I managed to restrain myself.</p><p>"... I'm going to take a shower."</p><p>I nodded and sat on the bed as she had said. However, the idea that Ioka usually slept here made it hard for me to keep calm. I listened to the distant sound of the shower as I looked around aimlessly.</p><p>The room was extremely cluttered, with piles of garbage bags everywhere. Through the bags, it looked like they were all filled with plastic, probably food wrappers bought from convenience stores. In one corner of the room were stacks of blue boxes with numbers on them. If that had been the case since she moved in, then this state had been going on for more than a year.</p><p>I looked into the kitchen, which was occupied by dirty dishes and cups. The stove area was exceptionally clean, looking as if it had not been used for cooking. Fortunately, there was no rotten or strange smell.</p><p>After waiting for a while, I suddenly wanted to go to the bathroom.</p><p>But I found it awkward to talk to Ioka, who was still showering.</p><p>I went to the hallway and saw that the door that was closed before was now open, so I looked inside ..... And then I saw it.</p><p>The room was full of clothes.</p><p>Only this room was different from the rest. The clothes were neatly arranged in transparent boxes, many hangers were arranged like in a clothing store. Many shoes that I had never seen before were arranged in pairs on the shelves.</p><p>I see, now I understand. This house, like it's owner, has sacrificed everything in life and devoted her whole body and mind to fashion.</p><p>Without a doubt, this is where Ioka's refuge is.</p><p>So what can I do? I went back to the room, made up my mind and picked up a garbage bag.</p><p>***</p><p>"Sorry it took me so long .... huh?"</p><p>After a while, Ioka came out of the bathroom and looked around the room in surprise.</p><p>"Sorry, I just tidied up a bit."</p><p>"No need to apologize, why did you do that, Aruha?"</p><p>"No reason. The garbage was already piled up, I just threw it away and washed some dirty dishes. I didn't throw anything important away. Besides, I borrowed the key to the entrance from before."</p><p>"I wasn't asking about that..."</p><p>The bags were mostly plastic, so they were very light. Fortunately, the apartment complex's dumpster was open 24 hours. The dirty dishes were mostly plates and cups, so there was no food waste. Actually, cleaning up was much easier than it looked.</p><p>"After all, I cleaned up without telling you, you won't complain, will you?"</p><p>"You're really bad, Aruha."</p><p>Ioka pouted playfully. Seeing this, I couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>"I hope you take it as a kind gesture."</p><p>"... You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you so much."</p><p>She looked crestfallen, and actually lowered her head.</p><p>"By the way, do you have a vacuum cleaner?"</p><p>"Well... probably..."</p><p>"You're so ambiguous..."</p><p>After using the vacuum cleaner, which Ioka pulled out from under the bed, and cleaning the dust and other debris from under the garbage bags, the room was much cleaner and livable.</p><p>Ioka contemplated the new state of the room with a silent expression.</p><p>I sat up in bed, feeling a little tired from the cleaning.</p><p>"I live alone too, so I understand your difficulties."</p><p>Ioka let out a sigh.</p><p>Perhaps out of embarrassment, her face was red.</p><p>I realize that my hard work cleaning up wasn't just out of pure kindness.</p><p>"I'm sorry about the hairpin."</p><p>"Are you still thinking about that?"</p><p>She sat up in bed, his face alternating between surprise and speechlessness.</p><p>Then she suddenly relaxed and said,</p><p>"Come here, Aruha."</p><p>After saying that, she patted the bed beside her.</p><p>Obediently, I sat down beside her.</p><p>She looked me straight in the eyes.</p><p>"Please don't wear that expression. It's not your fault, it's my fault. Because I'm a bad girl and I'm possessed by the devil, that's why it doesn't work."</p><p>"No, it's my fault. If only I could have exorcised the devil earlier .... then the hairpin wouldn't have been lost .... and the scene where we were together wouldn't have been captured..."</p><p>My hand, which was resting on my knee, suddenly felt hot, and I stopped.</p><p>"Enough is enough. Maybe it's fate."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>With her head down and eyes drooping, Ioka began to speak slowly.</p><p>"I used to live in Akita and was a normal girl ..... or so I thought. I never had any self-confidence and always did what my parents told me to do. I didn't even know how to take care of my appearance, let alone take an interest in fashion. I just looked at the world through the gap in my bangs. My parents only cared about my test scores and thought that worrying about my appearance or my clothes was a bad thing. They expected me to get good grades on exams and if I didn't, they scolded me. Eating was my only way to relieve stress. But after I entered high school, many girls were interested in fashion, and the people around me seemed to shine brightly .... however, I felt that those things had nothing to do with me. Just then, I went with my family on a trip to Tokyo. By chance, I happened to walk past a small store called Naratel which at that time was still relatively unknown .... Although at that time I couldn't understand the situation .... but even I, who knew nothing, felt that there was something unique about it. However, if I were to buy clothes, I didn't know how I would be scolded, so I secretly bought a hairpin. It was the star hairpin. At that time, I didn't know anything. However, I still don't remember what story that hairpin had. But it looked very shiny, and it was my treasure. On the second day back from the trip, I left the house and put the hairpin in my hair on the sly, and then went to school. Afterwards, a friend paid me a compliment, "You look like a model." It was just a casual compliment. But, for me, the impact of those words was enough to change my world. So I believed it and I was happy, forgetting everything else and letting myself go .... then I secretly signed up for a modeling audition. On the day of the audition, the stage was full of girls 100 times more fashionable than the most fashionable people in my class. I felt out of place. I was like a little pebble among shining stars. I still remember that day, I didn't participate in the audition and just went home. Even now, I can't put into words the feelings I had at that moment. Regret, sadness, misery, jealousy, I think I had it all. But there was only one feeling I will never forget. "The desire to win." From then on, I began to transform myself. I changed my diet, started exercising and practicing judo. And I went to clothing stores and bookstores .... I was no different than I am now. Of course, my grades went down. My father and mother were always angry, saying I had become a bad person. Funny, I hadn't done anything wrong. Still, I was happy about the changes that had taken place in me. The more I changed, the more I liked it. I was completely absorbed in it. A year later, I challenged the audition again. I was no longer a pebble. But I had a body and heart willing to fight to the end. I passed the audition and started working as a model. However, the jobs available in the field were not noteworthy. I knew that there were many girls in the world who aspired to be models since they were born by their parents' wish. I was a step behind from the beginning. At that time, I had set my own goal. If I hadn't bought the star hairpin, I wouldn't have wanted to achieve anything. So, I wanted to become a model that Naratel could one day use. Before that day came, I wouldn't lose to anyone. That's what I thought. When I told my parents that I really wanted to be a model, they were furious. I thought that for them to approve of me, I could only go to high school. So I studied hard and got into a high school. Although my parents are still opposed to modeling, they have come to accept it and let me go to high school while supporting me financially. After joining the agency, I also worked hard. Shimizu-san, although he worries a lot, is very capable. With these strengths, I was able to participate in the Naratel styling manual. My dream came true. That's what I think. Then, I found out that Naratel was participating in the Collection Total Girls fashion show .... you know the rest."</p><p>I listened to her words silently.</p><p>Many times my emotions were about to boil over, but I restrained myself.</p><p>I was unaware that she had the goal of participating in the Naratel parade with such feelings.</p><p>And I also didn't know beforehand what that star ornament in her hair meant to her.</p><p>"It's really important."</p><p>"Well, I said it before, it's like a talisman, I don't need it anymore."</p><p>"But, now...."</p><p>Ioka turned her body toward me and put strength into her overlapping hands.</p><p>Then, suddenly, she came to herself and looked away, then gently parted her lips.</p><p>"Because Aruha is here."</p><p>I've been thinking about what I can do for her.</p><p>But in the end, I haven't been able to get rid of the devil and just held her back.</p><p>I've been a bit of a hindrance.</p><p>But if I can be a talisman for her, I'll be satisfied.</p><p>"... I'm very tired. Let's go to sleep."</p><p>Ioka said that, and suddenly dropped onto the bed.</p><p>"You said sleep...? Should I sleep with you?"</p><p>She looked up slightly at me.</p><p>Her long hair was spread out on the sheet.</p><p>"There's no other choice, have you forgotten? Your clothes are still being washed."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"It won't be dry until tomorrow morning. You can't go out in these clothes, can you?"</p><p>"Um, do you have any other clothes? Even if it's women's clothes, it's fine."</p><p>"No way. I'm not lending you any."</p><p>"Ioka, why?"</p><p>"I said we should be together..."</p><p>She curled into a ball on the bed and pouted her lips.</p><p>"... I don't want to be alone, isn't that right?"</p><p>Seeing this behavior, I felt my heart break. I felt a mixture of emotions in my body, crashing and crashing all over the place.</p><p>"It's not that it's not okay, but what should I do? That I..."</p><p>"What do you plan to do?"</p><p>"It's not that!"</p><p>"On the other hand, don't you think I'll do something to you?"</p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p>"At critical times, I might be stronger."</p><p>"In any situation I would also give it my all..."</p><p>"Endurance?"</p><p>"It's not... that..."</p><p>Seeing my nervous appearance, Ioka's eyes narrowed like a crescent moon.</p><p>"All right, get ready for bed. I have a new toothbrush at home."</p><p>I gave up completely and got up to go to the bathroom next to Ioka. She put cream on her face and I brushed my teeth beside her with the brush she had given me. Looking at the parallel figures in the mirror, we seemed to have entered a different world, with no sense of reality.</p><p>Soon, Ioka finished her preparations for sleep and went to bed.</p><p>"Where should I sleep?"</p><p>"Of course you will sleep here."</p><p>After saying that, Ioka patted the place beside her.</p><p>"I'll sleep on the floor."</p><p>"It's too hard to sleep on it. Does this room look like it's set up for a mattress?"</p><p>I had no answer. There wasn't even a couch, let alone a mattress. I had just ordered this room, I knew there wasn't one.</p><p>"Okay, come here. Hurry up."</p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p>Although I was hesitant, I was also exhausted.</p><p>Fatigue overcame rationality.</p><p>I quietly entered the bed next to her.</p><p>The warmth of her body had already warmed the bed.</p><p>As soon as I got in, the narrow bed was filled. Her droopy-eyed face was within reach.</p><p>Ioka reached toward the head of the bed and pressed the remote control for the light. With a "beep," the lights went out.</p><p>"... Well then, good night."</p><p>She turned around, her back to me.</p><p>This went on for a while, but I couldn't fall asleep.</p><p>I didn't even dare to turn over, I could only carefully maintain my rigid posture.</p><p>Every breath was filled with her fragrance.</p><p>After a seemingly eternal time, I heard Ioka's soft voice.</p><p>"Hey, are you still awake?"</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>Hearing my reply, she twisted and turned toward me.</p><p>"Umm..."</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"Umm, how should I put it..."</p><p>"You're worried about the pictures, aren't you? I'll think of a way to convince Rosy tomorrow..."</p><p>"No, it's not that. But this matter is indeed..."</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Ioka decided to speak.</p><p>"Aruha, why do you want to stay by my side?"</p>

<p>I couldn't understand the meaning of this question.</p><p>"After all, I ... burst into flames again, and became a laughing stock, and even my house is like that ... it would be better not to get involved with a devil-possessed woman like me, don't you think?"</p><p>"That's..."</p><p>Different answers swirled in my mind.</p><p>Long hair like a waterfall was right in front of me.</p><p>Everything about Ioka was at my fingertips.</p><p>I never thought there would be such a strong desire in my heart, I surprised myself. This feeling seemed about to explode at any moment, the pressure was almost tearing my body apart.</p><p>The closer I got, the more I wanted to get closer and understand more about her.</p><p>Under an irresistible force, I fell toward her. She was like a falling meteor, a shooting star.</p><p>But because of that, there was now only one answer available to me.</p><p>"....Because, I am your exorcist."</p><p>"Is that true?" Replied Ioka after a moment's hesitation.</p><p>I couldn't look at her like that, so I turned my back on her.</p><p>What was Ioka's wish? I already had the answer.</p><p>If I was a so-called exorcist, I should have immediately said what the wish was and confirmed whether it was the right answer.</p><p>Devils are there to fulfill wishes that even the person herself may not have realized she had. Desperate wishes that have not yet been fulfilled. As Sai-san said earlier, that's youth. Whether it's me or Ioka, we were probably all fooled by that beautiful statement.</p><p>Wishes fulfilled by devils can't be good things.</p><p>They are the dirtiest and ugliest desires of one's heart.</p><p>But I couldn't say that to Ioka now.</p><p>Is it so as not to hurt her fragile being any more?</p><p>That is also true sincerity.</p><p>But half of it is also for me.</p><p>I understand that in the end I will have to exorcise her.</p><p>But after the exorcism, I will no longer be an exorcist.</p><p>I will just be an ordinary stone by the side of the road.</p><p>Now, I just want to hold on to this moment. That's what I thought.</p><p>I repressed my feelings, desires and wishes inside me.</p><p>To prevent them from accidentally bursting out, I carefully sealed the cracks in my body.</p><p>After stiffening my body for a while, I soon felt something soft behind me.</p><p>As I tried to control myself not to startle, I slowly turned my head and saw Ioka, who had her eyes closed and was hugging me.</p><p>The pillow she used to use had been pushed aside.</p><p>Although I wanted to scold her for not understanding human emotions, it's just a way of redirecting anger.</p><p>I told myself.</p><p>(I'm just here. I'm just here.)</p><p>Because a small stone that is attracted by the gravity of the stars is bound to burn.</p><p>***</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>After waking up, it took me some time to realize where I was.</p><p>Seeing Ioka asleep beside me, I couldn't help but let out a sigh.</p><p>She was still asleep. Her sleeping position was so bad that it was obvious at a glance. The blanket covering her was pulled up, and the lower part of her body was almost falling off the bed.</p><p>"Mmm... Mmm..."</p><p>Perhaps sensing me waking up, she furrowed her eyebrows and groaned in discontent. Then, keeping that expression, she cocked her head slightly and opened her eyes slightly.</p><p>"Good morning, Aruha..."</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, she closed her eyes again.</p><p>"You're very sleepy."</p><p>"It's okay, I'm fine..."</p><p>"Do you have work today?"</p><p>"None."</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh at the sight of her so seriously bedridden.</p><p>Today is Sunday and she doesn't have to go to school. If she doesn't have modeling work today either, then there's no need to rush to wake her up.</p><p>"Then, you can go back to sleep."</p><p>She replied in a fluffy, cotton candy voice before dropping her head with a thud.</p><p>Is she really tired, or does she just naturally like to sleep in bed? I don't know why, but I get the impression it's the latter.</p><p>Still, she gets up early every day to go running, truly remarkable self-discipline.</p><p>When I went to get my clothes, they were already completely dry. After putting them on, I finally felt that I had recovered in several ways.</p><p>I tiptoed to the kitchen, quietly opened the fridge and looked inside. As expected, there were hardly any decent ingredients.</p><p>"Do you want me to go buy something?"</p><p>I grabbed the key that was lying in the doorway and walked out of the house.</p><p>Bathing in the sunlight in a different place than usual made me feel like I had become someone else. I looked at the map on my phone and saw that there seemed to be a supermarket nearby. Anyway, I'll go there first.</p><p>Although it wasn't very early, the morning of a day off was still sparsely crowded. Maybe everyone was sleeping soundly, or maybe they were watching TV and thinking about their plans for the day.</p><p>As I was imagining the lives of each and every household, I happened to walk past the park.</p><p>A familiar figure sitting on a swing caught my eye.</p><p>That presence was unmistakable.</p><p>"Hey... Rosy!"</p><p>"Tsk, it's her boyfriend."</p><p>Rosy put on an expression of obvious displeasure.</p><p>"My name is Aruha Arihara. Why are you here...?"</p><p>"That's my line. You didn't happen to be staying at Ioka's house? You really are her boyfriend!"</p><p>Although I was on guard, Rosy acted as if nothing was going on. What's going on?</p><p>"Photos! Erase them! If they come out, I won't let you go easily!"</p><p>After Rosy groaned, she turned around and looked away.</p><p>"Come to think of it. I was scolded by Shimizu-san..."</p><p>"That's obvious."</p><p>Hearing that made me lose all motivation. I remembered Shimizu-san's face and wanted to applaud him.</p><p>"So Rosy came to apologize. She said she couldn't come back until she apologized."</p><p>Although Rosy pouted, she obediently lowered her head. I had a feeling something was wrong. Is she really reflecting?</p><p>"... I'll go call Ioka."</p><p>"Don't do that! Ioka's the one who's sly! Rosy didn't do anything wrong!"</p><p>She doesn't seem to be reflecting at all.</p><p>"Striving to outdo her, where's the cunning in that?"</p><p>"Ah, you don't listen, huh? You mean, "Don't speak ill of my wife?" Unbelievable. That's, isn't it, how to say, biased! Anyway, the groom is on Ioka's side. That's enough, no one is on Rosy's side. Anyway, I'm just a lonely person. Actually... Actually, Rosy should be the one!"</p><p>I was about to rebut, but my ears picked up a line of dialogue that I couldn't ignore.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Rosy knows why Ioka was chosen."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because Ioka is a doll."</p><p>"... A doll?"</p><p>"In the end, it was Rosy and Ioka. But Teruta chose Ioka. That's because Ioka is a doll that can be seen everywhere!"</p><p>Rosy continued chattering.</p><p>"This has happened before. Because my height is too tall, my personality is too strong, and I don't get along with others, I've been excluded! Even though I've tried so hard, I can't change these things! What should I dom What should Rosy do?"</p><p>I don't understand the modeling world.</p><p>Maybe this is something you see everywhere, something you take for granted, something you can't avoid.</p><p>It's a job that values appearance. Even movie actors are cast in roles that suit them. It's the same thing. There's no point in getting angry.</p><p>I could have responded by saying that.</p><p>But still...</p><p>I understand and empathize with Rosy's feelings.</p><p>Because I know, there is someone who has been working hard to fight for the same position.</p><p>If only the positions were reversed.</p><p>If Ioka were to lose that position for the same reasons.</p><p>I wouldn't be able to say those obvious words.</p><p>"Rosy can definitely do an even more amazing walk and steal the spotlight. You as a boyfriend saw it too, didn't you? Ioka... Ioka is just a walking doll model!"</p><p>Although I wanted to refute her, I couldn't find the words.</p><p>The reason was obvious.</p><p>Because I had already recognized it in my heart.</p><p>Compared to Ioka, it is Rosy who has left the deepest impression on me.</p><p>"Rosy didn't do anything wrong, she just took back what was taken from her. Even though it's so clear, why do they have to scold her? It's not fair! Why? Answer me! Hey!"</p><p>Rosy grabbed me by the shoulders, shaking me violently.</p><p>Even though I was being shaken, I still counterattacked.</p><p>"Still, taking a picture and spreading it around like that won't do any good to hurt others."</p><p>"But... because..."</p><p>"Ioka also worked hard until now. I've been watching her. Practicing constantly, focusing on clothes. Although I don't know if it's all fair... but, still, what you're doing is wrong!"</p><p>After a while, the force that was shaking me gradually weakened.</p><p>"Uwaaaah!"</p><p>Rosy cried aloud.</p><p>This made me remember.</p><p>Even though she is taller than me, even though she looks very mature, even though she is a talented model....</p><p>She is still a high school student.</p><p>Silently, I pat her on the back.</p><p>I don't think what Rosy did is right.</p><p>(So was it the right decision to choose Ioka?)</p><p>(Is Rosy's sadness and anger wrong?)</p><p>The result is everything, I remember Ioka's words.</p><p>Still... is this the right result?</p><p>"What you just said, is it true?"</p><p>Suddenly a voice was heard, and Rosy and I turned to look.</p><p>Although I hoped it wasn't her, our gaze betrayed us.</p><p>Standing there was Ioka.</p><p>"Ioka, why..."</p><p>"I came looking for you because you weren't there when I woke up. Forget the above, Rosy, let's talk about what you just said."</p><p>"It's true. Rosy wasn't lying. After the audition, I went to the designer's house, well, did I break into his private residence? Anyway, I asked him."</p><p>Ioka heard everything?</p><p>Rosy gripped her sleeve tightly.</p><p>I couldn't shake her off.</p><p>Ioka came right up to me.</p><p>"Why is Aruha with Rosy? What were you two doing?"</p><p>"It's just a coincidence..."</p><p>"The boyfriend heard Rosy's story! He heard me! He comforted me!"</p><p>A slapping sound echoed as Ioka forcefully slapped Rosy's hand away from mine.</p><p>"Ouch, what are you doing?"</p><p>"Stay away from Aruha!"</p><p>"He's not something that belongs to Ioka! You two aren't dating!"</p><p>"Why do you know all this?!"</p><p>"The boyfriend said it before!"</p><p>"Ioka! What you just did .... itwas too much."</p><p>In my mind, the doubts kept growing and the certainty kept deepening.</p><p>The answer to her wish.</p><p>Still, I kept trying to pretend I didn't see it.</p><p>This time, Ioka's sharp voice drifted toward me.</p><p>"Aruha didn't deny it. Aruha also thinks that I wasn't chosen because of my ability, right?"</p><p>"Absolutely not."</p><p>"Liar."</p><p>"I'm not lying to you."</p><p>Her voice trembled, sounded like she was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>"... Aruha. I already knew. About the picture in the Naratel, you actually thought Rosy's was better, didn't you?"</p><p>"That's not..."</p><p>"It was the same thing during the audition. Aruha said there would be other opportunities .... That means you thought Rosy would be the one, right!"</p><p>"No, I..."</p><p>My words were drowned out by a loud "boom".</p><p>Flames burned my eyes, and a hot wind rushed over my body.</p><p>"Danger!"</p><p>I immediately shielded Rosy.</p><p>However, the flames spat by Ioka sent me flying through the air.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>I hit the swing fence and fell to the ground.</p><p>The rough texture of sand spread across my mouth.</p><p>"What the...?! ...It's just like that time before ..... what the hell is going on?!"</p><p>Rosy lay in her seat, confused, as Ioka approached her.</p><p>Her body was burning fiercely.</p><p>"Ioka, calm down! You have to eat something...!"</p><p>I looked in my pockets. There was nothing. Of course, I came here because there was no food.</p><p>"Ahh, it's so hot!"</p><p>Ioka used her flame-wrapped hand to grab Rosy's neck.</p><p>It was an incredible strength.</p><p>She lifted Rosy, who was tall, with one hand.</p><p>A sound I had never heard before came from Rosy's neck.</p><p>"Hah..."</p><p>"Rosy. I never liked you. Always acting like you were special. Unfair? Don't joke with me. Blonde hair, blue eyes, tall figure, personality and confidence. did you win by working hard?"</p><p>She looked strange. Before she was just emitting moans or freaking out, but now she was clearly in control and talking.</p><p>"I'm different from you. I... I won it all with my own power!"</p><p>At this point, it hit me.</p><p>The flames had no shadow.</p><p>Therefore, the person emitting the flames shouldn't have a shadow either. It should be so.</p><p>However, there was something that really shouldn't appear.</p><p>It formed an absolutely impossible shape.</p><p>It's shadow formed the shape of a lizard.</p><p>That's the way it is.</p><p>The symptoms are getting worse, and it's happening fast.</p><p>"Stop it! Ioka!"</p><p>"She... Rosy didn't do anything wrong! If this keeps up..."</p><p>Ioka watched me with Rosy in her arms.</p><p>Her eyes should have been burning, but they were ice cold.</p><p>"Aaaah..."</p><p>Rosy let out a small scream.</p><p>Flames were spreading toward her.</p><p>"... I'm sorry. It's all my fault. I should have done the exorcism yesterday. It's my fault for running away. The devil's... no, yours."</p><p>"What are you saying?"</p><p>"Ioka, I know what your wish is."</p><p>I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I only had a few seconds to make a decision. I wasn't ready for this. But this has to end now.</p><p>"As far as I know, you've released fire a total of six times. The first time, I found you on the rooftop. The second time, I discovered your secret. The third time, you fought with Rosy. The fourth time was during the audition, the fifth time was during the photo shoot. And now, the sixth time. The common point in all these cases is that there was always an opponent in front of you, blocking your way."</p><p>Ioka's expression didn't change, but I thought she was listening to me, so I continued.</p><p>"You've been working hard to perform at the Naratel fashion show. But no matter how hard you try, if there is any obstacle that bothers you, you won't be able to achieve success. It will make everything in vain. You can't afford it. So...."</p><p>I have to admit it. Every day I spend as an exorcist with Ioka is satisfying to my heart. This is something I've always wanted to have.</p><p>But it has to end now....</p><p>As an exorcist, I have to exorcise the devil.</p><p>It started with the devil, it ended with the devil.</p><p>"....For your own victory, you want to burn everything that stands in your way."</p><p>Ioka's hand went slack.</p><p>Rosy falls to the ground with a thud, coughing and gasping in pain.</p><p>"Aruha, are you serious?"</p><p>She looked up at me with burning pupils.</p><p>"Do you really think I'm someone who wishes to hurt, burn and kill for my own victory, success and profit?"</p><p>"No... it's not that."</p><p>"What's the difference?!"</p><p>She asked aloud.</p><p>"That's right, you think I'm a person like that, always... always thinking that way!"</p><p>Flames erupted from the corners of her mouth.</p><p>"You say you'll exorcise the devil in me. You've always worried about me. I thought you understood me. I could sleep so well last night because you were by my side."</p><p>Tears didn't flow from her eyes.</p><p>Instead, little flames fell from her cheeks as she touched them.</p><p>"But you're only with me because you're an exorcist, right? If there was someone more pitiful than me, you'd go help them, wouldn't you? If there was someone more talented than me, you'd think they were better, right? I understand, nobody cares about me, I'm not special. I'm just an ordinary person."</p><p>"That's not true!"</p><p>"Then why is Aruha with Rosy and not me!"</p><p>"Being with someone, that doesn't even make sense!"</p><p>"Then don't stop me! If Rosy disappears, my dream will come true!"</p><p>She stopped breathing at the words she herself had uttered.</p><p>Yes. Ioka admitted it. She admitted her wishes and desires.</p><p>"Ioka. If you hurt someone else ..... I can't stay by your side."</p><p>I looked away from her.</p><p>"Your wish has been revealed. Now we can definitely exorcise the devil. Let's end it here."</p><p>"Aruha, what are you saying...?"</p><p>I extended my hand towards Rosy, who was sitting on the ground, and she stood up, somewhat confused.</p><p>Then, I faced Ioka and said,</p><p>"Listen to me, Ioka. Rosy came to apologize."</p><p>"At this point..."</p><p>"Rosy always thought Ioka was playing tricks. She's able to adapt well to her job and make friends, she's a normal Japanese girl. Rosy is different, modeling is the only thing she has left. But many have taken it away from her, in that case, Rosy also played some tricks..."</p><p>Rosy holds back tears and continues.</p><p>"But, it seems I was wrong. Ioka has also been working hard .... and she's not being cheating. I'm sorry for doing so many annoying things. I won't cause any more trouble. After all, Ioka was chosen .... for the fashion show, Ioka will parade."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Their gazes stare at each other.</p><p>A loud explosion is heard - "Bang!"</p><p>The flame disappears in an instant.</p><p>"Ah... How could this... Really... It's over..."</p><p>Ioka slumps, responding to the sound.</p><p>"I ... was praying ... for something like this...!"</p><p>She understood.</p><p>This was the strongest proof, proving that her wish was correct.</p><p>"Devil, I don't know if you can hear me. Now, no one will stand in her way. She no longer needs your help."</p><p>And my help is no longer needed.</p><p>"Aruha, wait, I..."</p><p>I didn't look back, and walked away with Rosy.</p><p>"Goodbye, Ioka."</p><p>Anything else, it couldn't be said.</p><p>Perhaps, I would never see her again.</p><p>Hearing her sobs coming from behind me, I left the place next to Rosy.</p><p>I didn't want to admit it, but I had to admit it.</p><p>The desire to become something caused jealousy, agitation and distortion.</p><p>And then, the devil made it happen.</p><p>In the form of flames.</p><p>If that's the case.</p><p>(Is youth a sin?)</p><p>(Is this Ioka's punishment?)</p><p>Even so....</p><p>Now, the devil must be gone. The sin has been washed away.</p><p>Ioka achieved the right desire for herself.</p><p>That is good.</p><p>I don't need to be by her side anymore.</p><p>My shoes kicked a small pebble, but I ignored it.</p>
