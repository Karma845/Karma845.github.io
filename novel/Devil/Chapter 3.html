<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Sushi and Mint Chocolate Ice Cream</h3></p><p>"Hey, haven't you heard yet? Saitou-sensei is going on vacation for a while!"</p><p>"Haaa?!" / "Hehhh?!"</p><p>The next day, Ioka and I let out a loud scream as we arrived at the infirmary.</p><p>I turned to Ioka, who was with both hands covering her mouth, she looked at me as if to say, "What exactly should we do?!", I also replied with my gaze, "Yes what should we do?!"</p><p>"Then, I will take her place. I am very jealous, I heard that she will go on a long trip abroad."</p><p>The substitute health teacher is a dignified, older teacher with a kind smile.</p><p>Of course, the teacher knows nothing about us.</p><p>We didn't say anything else. As soon as we left the infirmary, we quickly called Sai-san.</p><p>||&nbsp; "Hello~ it's me, from the infirmary, your dear exorcist, Sai Saitou!"</p><p>The familiar voice comes out of the speaker. The other person turns on the camera, and I wonder what face it will show me.</p><p>Sai-san greets me with her usual expression, waving her hand.</p><p>"I'm calling you because you're not in the infirmary!"</p><p>||&nbsp; "I already told you, the place where I am is the infirmary."</p><p>"That's twisted reasoning..."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Reasoning is very important. After all, devils are conceptual."</p><p>I wonder where she is, so I look intently at the background behind Sai-san.</p><p>Inside decorated with shiny wood, there is a wooden board with the names of fish written on it.</p><p>"It looks like you're in a sushi restaurant."</p><p>|| "By the way, didn't I tell you? I'm going to England soon."</p><p>"I've never heard you say the word 'England' before! Speaking of which, weren't we supposed to come today?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "Mmm, that's right. Well, a new piece of historical material related to devils turned up in Oxford, and the research team at the British Museum called me. And it turns out I have to write a thesis. So I'm at Narita airport eating duct tape sushi. Ah- the tamagoyaki is so good!"</p><p>"You're so mature when it comes to work, but your tastes are like a child's? Speaking of which, are you really writing a thesis?"</p><p>|| "You're being rude, little brother. We've known each other for a long time."</p><p>"Forget about being rude, what about Ioka?!"</p><p>||&nbsp; "Calm down. As a researcher, I've also given it some serious thought. Then, how should we deal with this event in the best possible way? And the conclusion my genius brain has come to...."</p><p>Sai-san says this while using her slender fingers to remove the tail of a shrimp.</p><p>||&nbsp; "....This task is something Aruha-kun can handle!"</p><p>"Did you just say handle? That means..."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Don't just say 'that means', just exorcise the devil, little brother."</p><p>"What are you talking about?! That's definitely not possible!"</p><p>||&nbsp; "In any case, just find out Ioka-kun's wish and make it come true. Ah, you can do it--no, I should say, if it's not you, it won't work."</p><p>"I have no idea what you're saying."</p><p>||&nbsp; "I have to pass baggage inspection once I finish eating my sushi, so I'll be brief."</p><p>Ignoring my reaction, Sai-san raised her three fingers over the screen.</p><p>||&nbsp; "I'll give you three tips. They are the fundamental basis for every exorcist."</p><p>I had no choice but to listen.</p><p>||&nbsp; "First - devils are conceptual. Therefore, once the flames are lit, they cannot be extinguished by physical means. That's why we have to investigate the desire that caused it. Anticipating it and preventing it is the key - do you understand?"</p><p>"...Sort of."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Good. Next, the second one - the devils are fulfilling their wishes through the flames. The flames must have a conceptual connection to Ioka-kun's wish. Find it."</p><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Well, you'll have to think it through. And finally, the most important - as it is conceptual, a devil's actions are logical. The answer you find will have to satisfy all the conditions."</p><p>"Wait, what does that mean?"</p><p>Looking at me with a confused face, Sai-san chuckled.</p><p>||&nbsp; "It's okay, it's okay. You're Yomiko's younger brother, right? Well then, I'm counting on you~!"</p><p>Then, her figure disappeared from the phone screen.</p><p>"Offline..."</p><p>Ioka looked at me with anxious eyes, no, with regretful eyes.</p><p>"Ah, really. to leave someone abandoned like that! Ghost! Devil!"</p><p>Despite her tantrum, the phone screen was still black, unresponsive.</p><p>"What should we do...?"</p><p>"Ohh..."</p><p>We looked at each other again.</p><p>To be honest, I feel a disappointment in my heart. I thought that as long as I took her to Sai-san, everything would be fine.</p><p>"Well, Sai-san will be back soon."</p><p>"How long does soon mean?"</p><p>"Well, maybe in a week, or a month, or..."</p><p>"That's not good at all!"</p><p>Ioka suddenly shouted, making me startle with surprise.</p><p>She approached me, her face pale, making her white skin look even more than it was.</p><p>"Isn't it good, so why?"</p><p>"It just won't do. We have to find a way to resolve this flame as soon as possible." She said, though she didn't explain why. But her grim expression conveyed the urgency of the situation.</p><p>Being an outsider like me, I shouldn't get involved in things outside my capabilities. But on the other hand, if I abandoned her and let her suffer, I would feel guilty.</p><p>After thinking about it, I came to a conclusion.</p><p>"I understand. Since Sai-san left, that must mean she thinks I can exorcise devils too. We just have to find out what that wish is. Yeah, no problem. There must be a way."</p><p>I tried to act stiffly to disguise my anxiety and pretend that everything was going well.</p><p>Despite this, Ioka's stiff expression gradually relaxed and he was soon smiling.</p><p>"Yes. Please take care of me."</p><p>Seeing her sincere expression, which was different from her usual blunt expression, even my body temperature rose.</p><p>"Let's have a strategy meeting."</p><p>"A strategy meeting?"</p><p>"There are a lot of things we need to discuss. It's not convenient to talk about it at school, so where should we ..... for example, while we're eating...?"</p><p>I suddenly realized halfway through what I was saying.</p><p>It's a quote.</p><p>"Are you asking me out on a date?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Good. If you had said 'yes' I would have kicked you out."</p><p>"I expect you to complain using methods other than physics."</p><p>"Destruction of the human body belongs to the field of biology, so it's okay."</p><p>"Even I have personal freedom."</p><p>"As a citizen?"</p><p>"In terms of general moral character."</p><p>"Oh, I don't remember learning this subject?"</p><p>"I hope you can start relearning it from elementary school."</p><p>"In any case, I have understood the need for the strategy meeting. I will contact you about the specific time later. That's all, you are dismissed."</p><p>I don't know where her bluntness went. After haughtily giving orders once again, she turned and left.</p><p>Although she was only walking, her back had the majesty of a ruler.</p><p>Well, I've been involuntarily dragged into a Jurassic Park.</p><p>In any case, I must complete the task I have been given.</p><p>I should concentrate on this matter.</p><p>***</p><p>"You made me wait a long time."</p><p>She was standing at the meeting place we had agreed upon, one hand on her hip and the other pointing imperiously at me.</p><p>Sakamaki City, where we live, is a port city with rivers and seas.</p><p>The Sakamaki River, which is also intoned in the school song, flows northwest of the city and nearby is a large shopping mall. Sakamaki Station, which merged with the mall, is also there. We were waiting at the monument in front of it. It seems that this monument commemorates a singer from the past, with a portrait and a song of that person. I wonder if Ioka will also have such a monument someday, I thought vaguely.</p><p>"You're exaggerating too much."</p><p>"I'm a model and models are very busy. You know that, don't you?"</p><p>"I don't know, and it's already 30 minutes before the scheduled time."</p><p>"It's not that simple. Try to think about it, what do you think all the time I've been waiting for you could be spent on?"</p><p>"Hmm ..... Getting into the game to claim the daily rewards?"</p><p>"Do you have a lot of free time...?"</p><p>"Enough free time to accompany you to exorcise devils."</p><p>At her surprise, I shrugged.</p><p>The scary thing is that even with this attitude, she's still so sophisticated it's suffocating.</p><p>The snow-white bare shoulders? is it a dress? The neckline of the dress is neckline style with lace trim. The skirt has a slanted design, which not only creates an eye-catching style, but also accentuates the balanced proportions. If you look closely, you will see that the dress is embroidered with snowflake motifs using the same silky thread. She is wearing red heels. It's common to see them, but surprisingly the contrast between red and white looks very elegant. She wears earrings that sway in the residual light even when you look away.</p><p>And the leading lady who brings all these charms together is Ioka Ito. She completely captures the beauty of her outfit and makes it her own.</p><p>"Stop talking nonsense. Let's go."</p><p>"But, you're the one complaining..."</p><p>She ignores my feelings and walks away.</p><p>I follow her powerful footsteps, capable of leaving footprints on concrete streets, feeling like a researcher studying wild animals. I follow her with this feeling.</p><p>"Um, where are we going?"</p><p>"There's a coffee shop I go to often. I think we can have a good conversation there."</p><p>A coffee shop she go to often, is a strange phrase to me. I can't help but feel surprised. Even though we go to the same high school and live on the same street, Ioka Ito and I seem to live in different worlds.</p><p>"So, any progress?"</p><p>My uneasy feelings are like a swinging balloon. However, Ioka firmly grasps the string tied to my emotions.</p><p>"Although I have conducted various investigations."</p><p>As I walked, I picked up my phone.</p><p>Since I was appointed as an exorcist, I can't ignore devils. With this civilized tool, I can find a lot of information about devils just by searching.</p><p>But most of the content is the same, they just tell me to reveal the hidden truth, destroy the enemies, or transform into the opposite sex I like, and so on. Most of them are also accompanied by terrifying and strange monster images, is the thing possessed by Ioka also terrifying? When I think about it, I get goosebumps.</p><p>However, there is no useful information.</p><p>Although I have researched devils, there is nowhere that writes about how to exorcise them. No, actually there are a few methods written, but they all consist of reciting the Bible and pressing on the cross, which seems to have no effect.</p><p>Find a conceptual connection.</p><p>This is the method Sai-san said.</p><p>"... I want to know more about Ioka."</p><p>"That's low class."</p><p>"Excuse me. I'm not asking because I like you."</p><p>"What did you say? Please put more effort into it."</p><p>"You make me feel conflicted..."</p><p>Hearing my complaint, Ioka raised her straight nose and put on airs.</p><p>"Well, it's something that has to be done. So what do you want to ask?"</p><p>Seeing that she was willing to cooperate, I was slightly relieved. After all, Ioka Ito's attitude made me wonder if she really wanted to solve the problem.</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>I walked and thought.</p><p>"When did the flames start appearing?"</p><p>"I remember it was during the spring and summer photo shoot. They first appeared when I was talking about outfits with the stylist. My body became hot and my consciousness became cloudy, and the fire .... spread slightly to the lamp, causing a big commotion. Everyone thought it was because the lamp had overheated..."</p><p>I tried to picture the scene at that moment. Most people wouldn't believe that flames could come out of a person's body unless they saw it with their own eyes.</p><p>"Is there something that's been bothering you?"</p><p>"Other than the devil, nothing has been bothering me because I'm perfect."</p><p>"Come on, there must be something. Like arguing with friends or your parents..."</p><p>"I don't have any friends."</p><p>This was unexpected. Normally, a popular model might enjoy a fulfilling social life.</p><p>"Please don't make that surprised face."</p><p>"I'm not making that kind of face."</p><p>"Then, what kind of face are you making?"</p><p>"... I'm sorry, you really surprised me."</p><p>I was so perceptive that I seemed to have superpowers. No, could it be that I was really bad at hiding my expressions?</p><p>"Could it be the desire to want friends?"</p><p>"Friends are something you have to choose for yourself and I don't have time to play the "friendship game". I'd rather use that time to learn more about fashion. In fact, right now..."</p><p>Her mouth tightened on both sides. Even I don't question her so thoroughly because I like her, but her supposed eagerness doesn't seem to be an excuse to complain about me.</p><p>However, the term "friendship game" is a very sharp phrase.</p><p>Perhaps sensing my thoughts, Ioka continued hesitantly.</p><p>"It's not just me, all the others glow. It's a tough world, after all."</p><p>"They glow...?"</p><p>The word "glow" naturally reminded me of flames. Could competition be the root of the problem?</p><p>"Excuse me."</p><p>As I was lost in my thoughts, someone suddenly spoke to us--no, just to Ioka. It took me a moment to react.</p><p>"Yes, can I help you?"</p><p>Ioka didn't hesitate and answered immediately.</p><p>The one who spoke was a petite woman who, from her attire, appeared to be a member of society. She was probably about the same age as Ioka.</p><p>Noticing that Ioka had stopped walking, I turned around to look. It would be strange to return specifically for this conversation, so I watched from a close distance.</p><p>"Umm ..... you're Ioka-chan, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>She smiled sweetly, warmer than any expression she'd seen from before.</p><p>"That's amazing! I've always been a fan of yours. In person you're even prettier ..... and you're very fashionable too..."</p><p>"Thank you so much. Your blouse is also very pretty."</p><p>"I bought it from a poetry store that Ioka-chan wore in a magazine..."</p><p>"It looks great on you, I'm jealous."</p><p>"No, no. Umm, can I take a picture with you?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>Saying this, Ioka immediately brought her face close and posed, and the woman took out her phone to take a picture. Although I didn't see what expression Ioka had, I'm sure she sketched a perfect smile.</p><p>"T-Thank you! Can I show it to my friends? On social media or something?"</p><p>"Although I'm not sure if it's worth bragging about, as long as you're happy."</p><p>"I'll treat it like a treasure!"</p><p>As she looked at her phone, the woman walked away satisfied. After watching her walk away, I approached Ioka.</p><p>"Ah, I'm sorry I caused you trouble. But I was also surprised, you're really famous."</p><p>Ioka continued on her way and I walked back to her side.</p><p>"It's not like that. Not many people talk to me."</p><p>She snorted and laughed self-deprecatingly.</p><p>For some reason, her appearance made me uncomfortable, so I tried to pay her a compliment.</p><p>"You handled it perfectly, you surprised me again."</p><p>"Of course. Although it's rare, it's still possible for someone to talk to you, and it's also possible for them to watch you from the side."</p><p>"There are also admirers among people who are much older than you."</p><p>"Yes. They often tell me that it's weird. Although I think it's a good thing, I still hope there are more fans my age."</p><p>Ioka speaks in a way that is almost like a producer. I feel like I understand her. Ioka is both firm and mature, and this is even more evident in her photo shoots and videos. Perhaps it is because of this perfection that she is a bit difficult to approach.</p><p>"Please don't misunderstand me."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Even though I don't have friends, I don't feel alone. There are people who support me like that, and there are also people who work with me. ...However, there are also some side effects to that."</p><p>"Side effects? Like what?"</p><p>"Like stalkers."</p><p>I was speechless.</p><p>"You should have mentioned this big problem from the beginning! I didn't hear you say anything about it before!"</p><p>"It's nothing, it's not a big deal."</p><p>"It's not!"</p><p>"Once, someone figured out my schedule and ambushed me at the point of my destination. He was tall and always wore a black coat, a baseball cap and a black mask covering his face. That's it."</p><p>"That suspicious outfit that looks like it came out of a painting is strange, isn't it?"</p><p>"I think so too, but it really happened in reality..."</p><p>That appearance reminded me of a dark wizard I had read about in a book. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed to me that this had something to do with devils.</p><p>"Oh... that's scary."</p><p>"It isn't. Mainly, this incident proves that I'm a model who can even touch the hearts of people like that."</p><p>"That's being too positive."</p><p>Although I think it's natural for Ioka's conditions to arouse men's perverse desires.</p><p>"Besides, I'm very strong."</p><p>She said it matter-of-factly, and I couldn't help but give her a serious warning.</p><p>"Although I've experienced it personally, it's very dangerous to face a physically strong adult man. If you're being followed, you should run away as soon as possible."</p><p>Ioka didn't reply, but stopped and looked at my face.</p><p>The earrings were swinging at a very close distance.</p><p>Her gaze almost pierced me.</p><p>"Could it be that you're worried about me?"</p><p>"After all, the known is feared, the unknown is poisonous."</p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p>Ioka didn't look away, but kept her gaze fixed on me, puzzled.</p><p>It went on like that for a while.</p><p>She seemed to have noticed something, and then suddenly....</p><p>"Ah! The stalker!"</p><p>"Where?!"</p><p>I looked in the direction she was pointing. There were a lot of people coming and going along the main street in front of us, but I didn't see any figure that looked like a stalker.</p><p>Still, I stepped forward to protect her, who was startled.</p><p>She grabbed my wrist with her slender hand and hid behind me.</p><p>I still couldn't see any shadows.</p><p>(Where was he? What should I do if he attacked? Can I win? That's difficult. In any case, I have to get out of here first!)</p><p>I grabbed Ioka's hand. The temperature was normal, and there was no lizard either. I shouldn't worry about the flames for now.</p><p>"Hurry up and run!"</p><p>I tugged on her hand and ran off like this.</p><p>No, I wanted to run away.</p><p>But she stood there motionless.</p><p>I looked back, and Ioka was looking at me with a mischievous smile.</p><p>"...It could be..."</p><p>"Yes. I tricked you."</p><p>"Please forgive me..."</p><p>I weakly let go of her hand.</p><p>"My acting skills are pretty good too, aren't they?"</p><p>"There's no way I can praise you in this situation!"</p><p>"But being bullied really makes me uncomfortable."</p><p>"Weren't you saying it wasn't a problem?"</p><p>"There is one thing that is real."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>I replied in a curt tone.</p><p>"That there really is someone who cares about me."</p><p>How can she confirm this with a lie? Even I want to rebuke her like this.</p><p>But seeing her mischievous smile, all my words got stuck in my throat.</p><p>Ioka nodded satisfactorily, then snapped her fingers.</p><p>"It's settled. Change of plans."</p><p>Then, she started walking in the opposite direction from before.</p><p>"Hey? W-Wait, where are you going?"</p><p>She turned her head, her black hair fluttering in the rhythm of the wind.</p><p>"I'll tell you more about me."</p><p>***</p><p>Ioka took me to a clothing store inside the mall.</p><p>The huge mall was lined with countless fashion-related stores.</p><p>"Welcome... Ah, it's Ioka-chan!"</p><p>"It's been a while, Kaname-san."</p><p>Facing the kind store manager, Ioka bowed politely. The clerk had a soft tone of voice, and her bangs covered one eye. She wore her hair short in the back and sported a memorable hairstyle. Apparently, the clothes she was wearing were probably from the store, and the outfit had a lot of personality and seemed very fashionable. As you would expect from a fashion store employee.</p><p>The thick plastic ID card has the words "Kaneko Kaname" written on it.</p><p>However, Ioka has a certain way of dealing with people and handling things when she is out and about.</p><p>"What's the matter, didn't you come here a while ago?"</p><p>"I'm here today with a friend. This is Arihara Aruha."</p><p>"Hello."</p><p>I greeted her first, feeling awkward in this situation. I'm not used to this kind of situation.</p><p>"A friend?!"</p><p>"You don't have to be so surprised."</p><p>"I'm sorry. But it's the first time something like this has happened."</p><p>Seeing the manager's exaggerated reaction, I couldn't help but laugh. Even though Ioka is good at interacting with people, there are still some things she can't bluff her way through. Maybe it's because she has a good relationship with the manager.</p><p>"So why did you bring your friend to this store that only sells women's products?"</p><p>"Do you have the styling manual?"</p><p>"Ah, I see. That's what it's all about. The spring and summer collection, right? Of course we have..."</p><p>The clerk smiled, walked in and returned with a thick book.</p><p>On the cover, a girl in a white dress smiles. Her bright red lips catch the eye.</p><p>"Hmm, is this the product catalog?"</p><p>"Yes. Well, go ahead and take a look."</p><p>I open the pages at Ioka's urging.</p><p>In it, the same girl from the cover poses.</p><p>The green background appears to be a forest. I wonder where it was taken. The leaves, of an impossible green, convey a sense of artificiality. In the center is a huge glass chair.</p><p>The girl stands on it like a conqueror, tall and proud. One hand gracefully grips the hem of her skirt, while the other holds a bright red, apple-like phone in it's case.</p><p>And then, it hit me.</p><p>On her white dress is embroidery the same color as the fabric, like snow.</p><p>"It's Ioka!"</p><p>Why didn't I notice it before? The dress was exactly the same as the one she was wearing now, and the person on the cover and the first page of the catalog was none other than Ito Ioka herself.</p><p>"That's right, it's me."</p><p>She puffs out her chest with more pride than anyone else. Kaname-san teases her about it.</p><p>"Ioka-chan looks very happy."</p><p>"I-I'm not happy. It's just because Aruha said he wanted to know more about me."</p><p>"Heh, so you guys have that kind of relationship."</p><p>Kaname-san teases Ioka. I guess they are very familiar with each other and are very close.</p><p>"No, we don't have that relationship."</p><p>"Why does Aruha-kun immediately deny it? Even though her face doesn't look particularly upset, Ioka-chan is still a high-class beauty ..... please give us a reason."</p><p>"It would be better if there were no rumors, right?"</p><p>"That may be true ..... But---!"</p><p>"However, the atmosphere is different. I hadn't noticed."</p><p>When I said this, Ioka's unhappy expression did a 180-degree turn.</p><p>"Right, right. Please feel terrified by my acting skills. In the spring and summer seasons, Naratel's theme was 'Snow White', so in addition to exuding nobility, we also made expressions that look simple and devout, and of course, the beautiful design of the dress itself is evident. We also put a lot of effort into making the embroidery memorable."</p><p>"Eh... Um... What?"</p><p>I couldn't follow Ioka's explanation and asked for clarification.</p><p>The store manager then pointed upward.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Looking up, there is a sign with the name of the store hanging above the cash register.</p><p>The characters carved into the sign read as follows:</p><p><b>NARRATIVE TALE</b></p><p>"Narrative Tale, abbreviated Naratel. With the concept of "just your own story", at first glance it looks like casual clothing, but it actually combines the core idea of fairy tales with interesting details. The brand's concept is to adapt to the modern lifestyle. Let the people wearing these costumes act as the protagonists of the story."</p><p>The store manager explained in a playful but flowing voice, like a tour guide introducing a tourist site.</p><p>"Wow! It's really amazing."</p><p>"Huh? Is it?"</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>Hearing my vague praise, the attendant responded lazily, but Ioka reacted strongly.</p><p>"At first glance, they may look like ordinary garments, but only the person wearing them knows the hidden details and context. This has been well received on social media and has become popular, and not only that, but even in everyday life, you can immerse yourself in the world of history just by wearing these garments. As you would expect from the genius designer Teruta Tezuka, the creator of this, that person is a wizard in every aspect, from creating the concept to designing the clothes."</p><p>As she spoke fluently like a machine gun, the store manager couldn't help but laugh.</p><p>"There she is, as always. Thank you for recommending her. As a store manager, I'm proud to be respected by Ioka Ito."</p><p>I have no idea. That's what I thought to myself.</p><p>I'm sure there's no one living on this street who hasn't bought something from this store.</p><p>I am no exception and have passed by this store countless times.</p><p>But such a store exists here--no, it should be that such a store exists here, something I would never have thought of.</p><p>"Ioka really likes it here."</p><p>"Yes, I really like it."</p><p>She flashed a boyish grin.</p><p>On the street where I live is her favorite clothing store, and in the store is her picture.</p><p>I looked at the product catalog again.</p><p>It is the work of Ioka Ito. Of course, the photographer, stylist, designer and many other people I don't know also worked on it. But it's a work that Ioka and these people created together, taking into account the atmosphere of the brand and producing it.</p><p>I always thought that the models and so on were just people with good looks and bodies who just took photos. But I was wrong. Ioka is a professional. This is her job.</p><p>"Everyone wants to be like you, Ioka."</p><p>I said admiringly, originally intending to.</p><p>But her expression was clouded. However, it was like a cloud that only covered the sun for a moment, immediately moving away and returning to it's original radiance.</p><p>"But it's impossible for others to become like me, isn't it?"</p><p>"Well, maybe that's true."</p><p>This unexpected reaction left me confused. I expected her to say something like, "Of course, everyone should look up to me as a role model!"</p><p>"I mean, it's about taking you as a goal, or aspiring to be like you..."</p><p>"Then, let me ask, why does Aruha wear clothes?"</p><p>"Well ..... because I can't go out naked?"</p><p>"There's no law that says you can't go out naked."</p><p>"There is, and it's very clear."</p><p>"What I mean is, why is it important to wear this attire?"</p><p>Looking at me with a confused expression, Ioka continued.</p><p>"What is the best thing to wear? Only you can decide that. In short, what does your ideal self look like?"</p><p>"My ideal self ..... myself..."</p><p>"What I do is just a suggestion. This garment can be worn this way and has this aesthetic appeal. That's all I'm trying to convey. Some people may like it and some people may not. It's just a matter of personal judgment and lifestyle. So why does Aruha think that following the model's style is a way to please others and take the easy way?"</p><p>"It seems like you're blaming me for something that doesn't exist."</p><p>"That's the way it is with anything. There's no point if you don't compare prices, think carefully and choose something for yourself. It's so boring. It's like those idiot guys who confess to me without knowing anything about me..."</p><p>She continued to complain, no longer directing her sharp tongue at me, but probably venting her anger.</p><p>Still, I seem to understand what Ioka is trying to say.</p><p>She firmly believes that clothes have the power to change oneself. The goodness or badness of clothing can only be judged on whether the person wearing it can come closer to his or her ideal self. Therefore, it's very important to choose for oneself.</p><p>If that is the case....</p><p>(What should people who don't have an ideal self wear?)</p><p>(Does everyone who shops at this store have an ideal self?)</p><p>As I let myself be carried away by Ioka's mood and look around, my gaze suddenly stops on something.</p><p>I hadn't noticed it before because I was focused on something, but there's a large mannequin display in a very prominent place. It's even bigger than a real person. It's what's called the main visual advertisement.</p><p>When I saw the picture on it, I couldn't help but stop breathing.</p><p>There was a witch.</p><p>The wide-brimmed, pointed-top sun hat looked like a witch's triangular hat, but the semi-transparent shirt and basket bag gave a refreshing feel. Perhaps because of this, the overall dark color scheme wasn't depressing at all. In one hand she held a phone with a red case of the same model as the one Ioka was holding in her hand.</p><p>But what left a deeper impression than the clothes was the model herself.</p><p>Her legs stretched out by the skirt were slender to the point of surprise. The curly blonde hair and blue pupils showed European blood, but her appearance was unexpectedly familiar.</p><p>Then, most striking was her expression.</p><p>Her eyes looked into the distance while her tongue protruded slightly. She wore a mocking smile. I had never seen a model with that expression. It was mischievous, but sad, angry, but with a hint of pain.</p><p>I felt helpless and stared at that expression.</p><p>I could imagine what she was looking at.</p><p>Her captivating charm is no longer that of a mischievous devil, but the majesty of a great witch.</p><p>"This person is amazing - should I say they have an aura, or something?"</p><p>I describe them with the scarce vocabulary I have while looking at the photo.</p><p>At that moment, the atmosphere seems to have changed slightly.</p><p>"... That's her, Rosamond Roland Rokugou."</p><p>Seeing Ioka talk about this topic, she brings a hand to her forehead as if she is deeply troubled, but it must be my imagination.</p><p>"Rosamond Roland Rokugou. Including me, everyone calls her Rosy."</p><p>Hearing this, I finally understand that she is talking about the model.</p><p>"Oh... do you know her?"</p><p>I wanted to ask if they were friends, but I quickly changed my words because, judging by the atmosphere from before, that was definitely not the case.</p><p>"We're in the same agency and have the same manager, so we're pretty close. She's tall and slender, with a unique personality ..... She's one of the hottest models right now, and she's only in her junior year of high school."</p><p>"She is a high school student?!"</p><p>I examine the photo again, but whichever way I look at it, she looks like she's in her mid-twenties. Although Ioka is also mature, Rosamond is more exaggerated.</p><p>"Wow, that's amazing..."</p><p>I can't help but express admiration.</p><p>"Yes, Rosy is amazing. She has good taste."</p><p>Hearing this voice, Ioka and I turn our heads and see who is standing there.</p><p>"Ioka, I was thinking that I haven't seen you lately. So you're here."</p><p>"It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with you anyway."</p>
<p></p><p>"Ah, you came here because you lost to Rosy earlier?"</p><p>"When have I ever lost to you? I'd like you to show me."</p><p>"Ah-- but Rosy's display board is more prominent."</p><p>"My modeling manual has been printed in large quantities."</p><p>"Rosy knows, that's called mass produced type right?"</p><p>"Who's the mass produced type, the one with the most is the strongest!"</p><p>"Ha! Anyway, Ioka is just a puppet following orders! Anyone can do that, Rosy is special!"</p><p>I took a step back to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. It was lucky I didn't say the word "friend" earlier. If I had, I surely would have been dragged into this.</p><p>"Hey, which side do you think is winning?"</p><p>"I don't know. As long as the clothes sell well for me, it's fine."</p><p>"Well, then, that person over there ..... uh, who are you?"</p><p>Rosy, who had a carefree attitude, seemed to have noticed me directly, and looked over here.</p><p>"Um... I'm Arihara Aruha...."</p><p>I gritted my teeth and gave her my name, despite my annoyance at my treatment, but I didn't know how to explain and hesitated.</p><p>"Ah, Ioka's boyfriend?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Ioka denied on my behalf.</p><p>"No, we're just friends, but I think he probably likes me..."</p><p>"Please don't use other people as tools to boost your ego..."</p><p>Even though it was just a silent grunt, it was already a total effort for me.</p><p>Rosy made a mocking grimace.</p><p>"What the hell. Rosy doesn't need anyone to get a rise out of her."</p><p>"Going out shopping with friends is a very normal thing to do, isn't it? Ah, I'm sorry. Someone like you, who doesn't have any friends, might not understand. After all, your personality is so bad, it's only natural for you to have no friends."</p><p>"Haaa?! It's you who has a bad personality! Rosy wouldn't wag her tail for anyone!"</p><p>"Please don't confuse freedom with recklessness. Every time you flame on social media, the agency's reputation also takes a hit."</p><p>"I didn't do anything wrong, I just spoke my mind! You're the one who just goes along with what others think! Don't you feel pitiful? You seem to have a lot of pressure on you. It's going to explode soon. Boom!"</p><p>"I... I'm not going to explode!"</p><p>"Hey, does your boyfriend think the other side is better?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Rosy suddenly tore her gaze away from Ioka and looked at me.</p><p>"Which do you think is better? Rosy or Ioka?"</p><p>I watched this verbal sparring nervously, but suddenly a gunshot rang out and I panicked.</p><p>"Well, um..."</p><p>It was an unpleasant question.</p><p>It's not something one should compare.</p><p>The correct answer would be to say that.</p><p>But...</p><p>The moment I was asked that question, I couldn't help but think.</p><p>(Comparing them?)</p><p>(Who seemed better to me?)</p><p>To keep my true feelings from showing, I looked at Rosy silently.</p><p>"Hmph."</p><p>Rosy looked confidently straight into my eyes, her blue irises shining brightly.</p><p>"Well, all right. But the First Look is definitely mine. I'll never give it to Ioka."</p><p>"That's what I wanted to hear. Because I will win."</p><p>"Huh? You? A dull looking doll? There's no way you're going to make it."</p><p>"I'm not a doll...!"</p><p>Ioka's rhythm suddenly became disordered and I was startled.</p><p>Her breathing quickened and I could feel that she was losing her cool. Is it simply due to the argument? If so, then it's not so bad. No, this isn't good, but it's still better than the worst.</p><p>I looked around, but I didn't see the figure of that thing. However, I still couldn't relax.</p><p>It looked like it's shoulders were shaking.</p><p>(This is going to be bad.)</p><p>Rosy and Ioka's fight kept attracting the attention of passersby, and more and more people stopped to watch. It's only natural, since the two parties are involved in the modeling book and display board.</p><p>"It feels a little hot..." Rosy muttered.</p><p>Yes, it does feel a little hot.</p><p>I looked around. There are a lot of people here, and there are clothes. If flames broke out here, it would become a disaster.</p><p>Just as I was about to turn to Ioka to talk to her, I saw her.</p><p>On her bare, white shoulder.</p><p>There was a black lizard.</p><p>It seemed to be waiting to be discovered by me, motionless there.</p><p>(This is bad.)</p><p>(We must leave here immediately.)</p><p>I grabbed Ioka's hand.</p><p>"What are you doing?!"</p><p>Ioka turned around and yelled at me, but I didn't let go of her hand.</p><p>Incredible heat emanated from our skin wherever they touched.</p><p>I looked Ioka in the eye and slowly shook my head as I held her hand firmly.</p><p>Suddenly, her eyes widened.</p><p>"Rosy."</p><p>"Hm? Are you calling me?"</p><p>"Wouldn't it be better to go somewhere else to discuss?"</p><p>"That's true. It attracts attention, but it will scare away customers..."</p><p>Although she wasn't as upset as I had imagined, it was enough for me to get her agreement. Just having an excuse to get out of here was enough.</p><p>"Rosy's the one who says that. Let's go, Ioka."</p><p>Ioka wanted to say something, but instead she closed her mouth, gritted her teeth and nodded silently.</p><p>Rosy, seeing the two of us, predictably scoffed at us.</p><p>"Aww, letting your boyfriend drag you by the hand? That's not like you at all! As expected, you can't do anything by yourself!"</p><p>I left Rosy's mocking laughter behind and ran out Ioka's hand in mine.</p><p>We quickly ran down the escalator and through the store, then found a bench in the subway street after running down a wide staircase. I let Ioka sit on it.</p><p>"Uuuu..."</p><p>As if trying to suppress something inside him, she curled up and groaned.</p><p>"Hey, open your mouth, I've got chocolate!"</p><p>She took the chocolate, and shakily popped a small piece into her mouth and swallowed it. I put my hand on her back and watched her.</p><p>"It's no use, the temperature won't go down..."</p><p>No sign of her calming down. Is she really getting worse, like Sai-san said?</p><p>It looks like the flames are going to come out at any moment.</p><p>I look around and see that there are a lot of people shopping. Although no one is paying attention to us at the moment, if flames were to come out, it would definitely be noticed. It's something to avoid at all costs.</p><p>I have to think of a way.</p><p>(What can I do? What can I do to calm her down? Is there anything around here that can help her calm down...?)</p><p>"W-Wait here!"</p><p>Leaving her behind, I began to move.</p><p>***</p><p>"Huh? She left?"</p><p>I looked around and finally found her.</p><p>She was walking staggeringly, not knowing where to go.</p><p>"What are you doing?! I told you to wait here!"</p><p>"I... I felt I couldn't stay here..."</p><p>"Well, that's fine. Anyway, come back here first!"</p><p>I forced her back to the bench.</p><p>She sat back down on it, exhausted and breathing heavily.</p><p>"Here, eat this!"</p><p>I knelt down on the floor and handed her the greenish thing I had just bought. The pink packaging had a logo with the numbers 31 superimposed over the letters BR.</p><p>The mints had no effect. The chocolate didn't help either.</p><p>So, let's try two at once.</p><p>Something fresh and sweet, something easily eaten.</p><p>That's right - mint chocolate ice cream.</p><p>"Why..."</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p>Ioka stared intently at the ice cream. She immediately took it and began to devour it.</p><p>Due to her high body temperature, the melted ice cream covered her hands and cheeks, but she continued to eat without worrying. I offered her the other one I had bought and she finished it quickly as well.</p><p>"Lie down."</p><p>"Mm..."</p>

<p>I helped her lie down and held her ice cream-covered hand.</p><p>I watched her like that, keeping an eye on her chest rising and falling in agony, as I started the stopwatch on my watch.</p><p>(1, 2, 3, 4....)</p><p>Her breathing gradually returned to normal and her temperature began to slowly drop.</p><p>Then, when the timer reached ten minutes, Ioka suddenly sat up.</p><p>"That's great..."</p><p>She didn't respond to my words and just sat down on the bench, hugging her knees.</p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p>Thinking that the devil's power had increased again, I became alert.</p><p>But what followed was the sound of snorting and sobbing.</p><p>I don't know why she's crying. Although I can think of many reasons why she might want to cry, I can't think of what to say to her. I can't think of a single thing to tell her.</p><p>I sit beside her in silence.</p><p>***</p><p>"I'm sorry you had to see me like this..."</p><p>Ioka forced out these words with reddened eyes.</p><p>I used a wet handkerchief that Ioka had brought to wipe her dirty face and hands.</p><p>After calming down a bit, she said she wanted to wash her hands and went to the bathroom.</p><p>When she came back in perfect condition, I noticed that this included fixing her makeup and unkempt hair, and recovering her chaotic mental state.</p><p>Although we narrowly avoided disaster, we couldn't go back to the mall. But we also couldn't go home after Ioka almost set the store on fire.</p><p>As we walked around looking for a place with few people, we ended up on the observation deck of a nearby building.</p><p>After an uncomfortable time of just the two of us in the elevator, we reached the 25th floor and gazed at the winding streets of Sakamaki City through the glass.</p><p>Between the square, gray houses of the various homes, there were scattered colorful advertisements. The parks and roadside trees looked lush, but there was something out of place about these natural objects. When I looked out at the distant harbor, the sea stretched ahead. It wasn't a particularly impressive sight. What did those who built this lookout expect people to see? I asked myself this question. No, we didn't live on this street to please the eyes of others. The idea of wanting a pretty view can be narrow-minded.</p><p>However, there are people who live for that.</p><p>For example, the person next to me.</p><p>I felt I should say something to the silent Ioka, so I tried to speak.</p><p>"We need to make more preparations beforehand..."</p><p>Flames could appear at any time, and I knew that. But I didn't know what that actually meant. If the thought of ice cream hadn't occurred to me, what would have happened? I couldn't help but feel a shiver.</p><p>I looked at her and saw her lips tightly closed.</p><p>"Hey, Ioka. Look, that's the school."</p><p>I pointed and Ioka looked in that direction. After confirming this, I continued speaking.</p><p>"Could Ioka that night see this from here?"</p><p>She still didn't say a word. After a moment's thought, I asked again.</p><p>"What were you doing at school at that time?"</p><p>Ioka looked at me, looked down again and answered.</p><p>"...Practicing steps."</p><p>"Steps?"</p><p>"Yes. It's basically walking practice. I don't have enough space at home, and I can't concentrate if someone's watching, so..."</p><p>"Even if flames came out, they wouldn't burn the surroundings, would they?"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>I remembered the scene from that day. Indeed, the rooftop was wide and open, and the floor was concrete. Considering the circumstances, it was not unreasonable.</p><p>"But do you really have to practice to this extent? If you were discovered, it would be bad."</p><p>Ioka Ito looked away and took a deep breath before turning to me again.</p><p>"I want to participate in a fashion show."</p><p>"Uh, like, wear clothes and walk around?"</p><p>I couldn't help but ask again. However, Ioka didn't answer, but continued.</p><p>"A model's professional life is short. We are already 17 years old, aren't we?"</p><p>"Did you say already...?"</p><p>"If you are a successful model, it is not uncommon to have participated in top-level fashion shows even at this age. Although photo shoots are also important, fashion shows are necessary for a career. Still, I haven't participated in any..."</p><p>She gritted her teeth, and looked inwardly unwilling.</p><p>"I'm already behind, and I have to find a way to catch up."</p><p>"Is that something you can participate in if you want to?"</p><p>After looking at me, Ioka continued in a somewhat more serene tone.</p><p>"Next fall and winter, Naratel will be participating in a fashion show called "Total Girls Collection" for the first time. I may be able to perform in it. And it will be my first time on the runway with a 'first look'."</p><p>"That brand before. Isn't it great?"</p><p>"No, I've only passed the initial fact check and I have to win on all subsequent selections ..... If I don't get a recommendation from the agency, I don't think it's possible."</p><p>After hearing so much, I finally got it.</p><p>"So that's why you're practicing?"</p><p>"It's absolutely necessary for me to win the first look this time."</p><p>I felt a slight discomfort as I heard her words. It was certainly a rare opportunity, but I felt there was a subtle meaning beyond that in her words.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Teruta Tezuka of Naratel is a genius. He breaks all common sense. Normally, he selects models based on the image of the collection, but this time he said he will match the model of the first look and create the entire fall and winter collection based on that."</p><p>"So that means..."</p><p>"If I become the first look, all the fall and winter clothes will be made to match my image."</p><p>I remembered the styling manual and the many garments printed in it.</p><p>"It's true that I absolutely want to win."</p><p>Suddenly, I remembered someone else who had mentioned the term "first look."</p><p>It seemed that Ioka had read my thoughts and had brought up that person's name.</p><p>"Rosy will also participate in the same audition. If I make it to the final selection--"</p><p>"Will you meet Rosy?"</p><p>"Yes. That's why, absolutely, I can't lose."</p><p>Her voice, full of urgency, suddenly became confused. I looked at Ioka in confusion, and she covered her face with her hands. Seeing her like that, I panicked and said,</p><p>"W-What's wrong?"</p><p>"Why do I have to spend so much time on this...?"</p><p>I didn't know what to answer.</p><p>"I let myself be easily convinced by her, and I couldn't even feel satisfied and speak up. Instead, I had to leave. All because my head was dizzy ..... If I hadn't, I would have won the argument without a doubt. I've always been anxious and afraid to go into places that might catch fire, and I can't even practice my catwalk steps well. If I let off flames during an important audition? What is this devil, why do I have to worry so much?"</p><p>That's right.</p><p>I had a dream to achieve, something I wanted to obtain.</p><p>This glow was too bright for me.</p><p>"It's okay."</p><p>"Don't say such irresponsible things."</p><p>"No, I can't be that irresponsible."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Because, I am your exorcist."</p><p>For your wish to come true, the only thing I can do is to exorcise the devil.</p><p>She opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but she said nothing and closed her lips.</p><p>She looked away, lowered her head, twisted her lips and her face filled with panic as she gazed at the landscape. The clear blue sky stretched out without a single cloud.</p><p>"It's very nice weather today."</p><p>I heard only a snort.</p><p>I knew why Ioka was doing this, but I didn't say anything.</p><p>Even a tyrannosaurus probably wants to look up at the sky from time to time.</p><p>I feel like I understand her a little now.</p><p>Surviving in a world where you have to be strong, hoping to become strong yourself.</p><p>But it doesn't matter how strong you are.</p><p>You can't always be strong.</p><p>"Other than that is there anything else? While the fashion show and your desire are related, it doesn't seem to have a direct connection to the appearance of the flames .... So I want to know more about you. That way, I'm sure we can find some clue."</p><p>"I see. Then let's meet tomorrow at 5 a.m. at the Sakamaki River."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>I replied helplessly. Afterwards, we stepped out of the observation deck. The elevator was descending at breakneck speed and the floor numbers on the screen were changing rapidly. After a few steps out of the building, she said to me,</p><p>"Um, there's something I want to ask you."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>I turned my head as I answered.</p><p>"I hope you can answer me truthfully."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Hey Aruha, between Rosy and me, whose picture do you think is the best?"</p><p>At that moment, I couldn't help but remember Rosy's lively photo.</p><p>Ioka was looking at me with crystal clear eyes, like a mirror.</p><p>No, in this situation, am I the mirror?</p><p>Mirror, mirror, the most beautiful person in the world is...?</p><p>"I think Ioka is better."</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>I don't know what Ioka thinks of my words.</p><p>But at least she didn't get angry, didn't cry and didn't let out flames.</p><p>We parted ways and headed home.</p><p>***</p><p>Left alone, I realized how exhausted I was. I couldn't do anything else today. I took a shower, absentmindedly looked at my phone and went to sleep. Tomorrow I had to go to class ..... ah, I had arranged to... No, wait.</p><p>At that moment, I realized the terrifying truth.</p><p>The agreed time and place is very strange, isn't it?</p><p>Why would we meet by the river at 5 a.m. on a weekday?</p>
