<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Stars Falling on a Stone</h3>

<p>A month had passed since then.</p><p>The Sakamaki Arena fire became front-page news. Although it appeared that all the cameras were instantly burned and damaged, only the moment when Ioka Ito burst into flames was broadcast, and the video quickly spread. There were various speculations about the cause of the fire, and although police and firefighters investigated thoroughly, no one was able to get to the truth, and the cause was eventually determined to be an unexplained explosion incident. After all, if she had been the culprit, she wouldn't have been burned. As for the existence of devils and such, no one would think of such things.</p><p>Naratel, who became the center of attention, faced the aftermath of the incident with a resolute and sincere attitude. Although there was a barrage of criticism over security management and other aspects, the investigation proved Ioka's innocence and, consequently, she received praise for her appropriate response to the disaster.</p><p>Ioka Ito and Naratel's fall and winter fashion show, which was interrupted by the fire, became the stuff of legend, and the issue was hotly debated on social media. Their garments sold like hot cakes and became difficult to acquire. How unpredictable life is.</p><p>The lead designer, Teruta Tezuka, stated in an interview,</p><p>[Only by overcoming difficulties can we turn evil into good, and dolls can become human. Unexpected things are the norm in a story called life. We will relive from this incident and become a more amazing story. I know Ito Ioka's story is also like this.]</p><p>Then, surprisingly, Rosy and Ioka seem to be on good terms. I can't imagine how two people who hated each other became like this, but they seem to communicate frequently now. After all, they're both models, so they must be exchanging meaningful information? Although I thought so, according to Rosy, they're talking about me. What are they talking about? It's as if I want to hear and don't want to hear at the same time.</p><p>Miu, who called concerned, cried loudly and then said that since I was in the hospital and would be bored, she sent me a playlist of classic rock songs as homework. From the beginning, I felt it should have been a playlist, but I didn't say anything because it seemed rude to point it out. It seemed a bit old-fashioned to me, most of the songs were in English and the music was full of noise, so I didn't understand what she was saying, but I could feel the feelings of the people desperately conveying something.</p><p>Then, I heard the song "Twentieth-Century Boy" for the first time.</p><p>After I was discharged, I met with Sai-san, who had returned. Although we talked about many things, in the end, that person's position can be summed up in one sentence.</p><p>"See? Everything went as I said, didn't it?"</p><p>Honestly, I was speechless. I won't be satisfied until I'm invited for sushi next time. Of course, not the round kind, but for two people, Ioka and me.</p><p>Speaking of Ioka, I still don't see her.</p><p>Although I heard about her situation through messages, I kept putting off seeing her in person for various reasons. I used my hospitalization as an excuse and took a break from school.</p><p>During that time, there was something I had to do.</p><p>(So, I wasn't able to meet with Ioka until that was over.)</p><p>Finally, after finishing the task and coming to a satisfactory conclusion, I reported to the school.</p><p>After class, I called Ioka Ito to the rooftop.</p><p>After gazing at the thin clouds in the sky for a while, I heard the sound of a door opening. There stood her figure, whom I had not seen for a long time. Ioka closed the door and slowly approached me. We were silent for a while, but then she opened her mouth awkwardly.</p><p>"It's been a while."</p><p>"Yes, it's been a while."</p><p>"Um... Is your body okay?"</p><p>"I'm fully recovered now. The doctors were surprised that I was about to die, but it seems that Sai-san partially fulfilled my wish with the help of a devils. Although, it's unclear why the devils didn't possess me."</p><p>"I see. That's good..."</p><p>She touches her chest as if relieved from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>"Um.. Aruha."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>With her head down, Ioka, who seemed to be facing the end of the world, said,</p><p>"I'm sorry. I was possessed by the devil and burned everything, even hurt you, Aruha. That's why you probably hate me and don't want to see me. I understand if you don't forgive me. That's all I can say."</p><p>She muttered without looking at me, clenching both hands tightly at her side. I was slightly surprised by her appearance.</p><p>"I thought you'd say to me, "As a popular model, I command you to come see me." Why don't you come see me now?'"</p><p>"T-That's impossible!"</p><p>Ioka doesn't seem so strict, but then again, it feels like this is who she really is.</p><p>"Uh, I should apologize. I didn't mean to be like that. I just had something I had to do no matter what."</p><p>"Something you had to do no matter what?"</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>I pulled a small, beautifully packaged box out of my backpack.</p><p>The box was tied with a blue ribbon.</p><p>"Here, it's for you."</p><p>"Huh? For me?"</p><p>"Who else is here?"</p><p>Prompted by me, Ioka took the little box with a magical expression.</p><p>"Um, why...?"</p><p>"Come on, open it and take a look."</p><p>She carefully ripped the tape off the back and opened the wrapper with a crunch.</p><p>Then she hesitantly opened the little gray box inside.</p><p>"Ah...!"</p><p>She alternated between looking at me and what was inside the little box.</p><p>"This is... How could it be...?"</p><p>"Why don't you try putting it on?"</p><p>Soon, trembling, she pulled it out of the little box with both hands and fastened it in her hair.</p><p>"How does it look?"</p><p>"Great, it fits me perfectly."</p><p>It was a small hair accessory with blue pebbles.</p><p>"Thank you so much. But why...?"</p><p>"Well... I ended up spending a lot of time looking for the right one. I felt I couldn't see you until I found it. It's not something high-end... but I feel like this is the one for you."</p><p>"Such... such things don't matter at all! What kind of feelings do you think I've had so far?! I really... I was really worried!"</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>Her voice became shorter and shorter until it was almost a cry.</p><p>"But I lost your talisman."</p><p>"I said it's okay! Because..."</p><p>"Yes. Is that why this isn't... a talisman, but a mark?"</p><p>"A mark?"</p><p>"It is a promise. That I will always be watching. So no matter where Ioka is, I'll know. So that I won't let you out of my sight. So that you'll never get burned again."</p><p>I looked up at the sky.</p><p>(Yes, that's right.)</p><p>(Because I promised.)</p><p>(Even if I can't shine like a star.)</p><p>(I should at least be able to watch over you like a stone.)</p><p>"Aruha, that means...!"</p><p>"Yes. I'm your exorcist."</p><p>I felt a strange discomfort and looked at Ioka.</p><p>She had a visibly displeased expression.</p><p>Hm?</p><p>I thought I had just said something good.</p><p>As she cocked her head to one side, Ioka snorted loudly.</p><p>"... Actually, I'm a troubled woman."</p><p>Saying this, she takes a step towards me.</p><p>"I have no confidence, although I have a lot of pride."</p><p>Gradually, her face came closer.</p><p>"I appear to try hard, but I'm self-critical."</p><p>Her hair falls naturally around her shoulders.</p><p>"No matter the moment, as long as I'm not treated in a special way, I'll be in a bad mood."</p><p>Her sharp eyes fix on me.</p><p>"I might get jealous or burned if I look at other girls."</p><p>The blue stones shine with deep radiance.</p><p>"But, I will shine in my own way. I'll shine so bright that you won't be able to take your eyes off me. So....."</p><p>And then, for a split second.</p><p>"Look at me closely, okay? Aruha."</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8JI6DFrEWeDm-kEwHcU2f1gDwSka42Ljx2bKcWqM6F7-DKG6-cZEO-rEB-OiiZV9R7NEAmeicdna3aKUTVOXXoN_n9NuKAkIurGh-AhThAbc7ArIhu8IQFRAluM23eZbBLtPphIUSGhjw-C9qiL8AxSj_0p--hYbQelmttaQShPqGuIB9x69XM78TGQ/s999/image(9).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="999" data-original-width="704" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8JI6DFrEWeDm-kEwHcU2f1gDwSka42Ljx2bKcWqM6F7-DKG6-cZEO-rEB-OiiZV9R7NEAmeicdna3aKUTVOXXoN_n9NuKAkIurGh-AhThAbc7ArIhu8IQFRAluM23eZbBLtPphIUSGhjw-C9qiL8AxSj_0p--hYbQelmttaQShPqGuIB9x69XM78TGQ/s16000/image(9).jpg" /></a></div><p>The world turned upside down.</p><p>Apparently, it is announced that nothing special exists in this world since the beginning.</p><p>From now on, we will definitely continue to be restless both physically and mentally due to unfulfilled desires.</p><p>And as long as youth continues, the devil will appear again.</p><p>But we will be fine.</p><p>Even if the stars go out and meteors fall, we won't go extinct like the dinosaurs.</p><p>Because we know how to make wishes not to the devil, but to the stars.</p><p>The deep blue sky stretches infinitely above us.</p>
