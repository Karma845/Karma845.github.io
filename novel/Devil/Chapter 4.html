<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Vomits on the Shore</h3>

<p>"Hey, Aruha, are you really okay?"</p><p>"To put it simply, I'm not. I'm no good for anything anymore."</p><p>In the morning, the next day, I was slumped over my desk in the morning classroom. Even getting up was difficult, and I couldn't concentrate in class. I was sure that from now on, all the information that reached my ears would flow from right to left like a rolled noodle.</p><p>"Do you want to go to the infirmary?"</p><p>"No, I'm not sick or anything, so I'm sorry, I mean, I wouldn't want to cause any trouble."</p><p>"Still, you don't look well."</p><p>Miu gave me a worried look. Even if I went to the infirmary, Sai-san wouldn't be there, and if I lay down on a bed, I'm sure I'd fall asleep in an instant. I have a feeling it's not a good idea.</p><p>"By the way, what happened since Ioka-chan took you? How did you get like this in just a few days? Is that normal?"</p><p>Miu furrowed her eyebrows suspiciously.</p><p>"Well, a lot of things happened."</p><p>"Tell me, is it the drugs? Or did something happen while you were making rock music?"</p><p>"Your mind is too sick."</p><p>"But, you and Ioka-chan, something happened, right?"</p><p>"Well ..... that's not entirely wrong..."</p><p>Although I felt bad for worrying Miu, there was no way I could tell her the truth. Like, Ioka was possessed by a devil and I was some kind of exorcist. But, I definitely made her worry, so it would probably be better to explain it to her without mentioning those things.</p><p>Why am I in this state? To understand that, we'd have to go back a few hours.</p><p>***</p><p>"Aruha will help me get rid of the devil, right?"</p><p>"Well, that's what I plan to do."</p><p>"In order to get rid of the devil, information is necessary."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So, in my daily life, I need you to be with me as much as possible."</p><p>"Well, that makes sense."</p><p>"In that case, we can act soon if there are signs of flames."</p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p>"Let's go then, Aruha. First, we'll run ten kilometers."</p><p>"Even so, I've never heard of running such a distance is the first thing in the morning!"</p><p>When I arrived at the meeting place at five in the morning, bleary-eyed, Ioka was already there, dressed in her training clothes, waiting for me.</p><p>In the dim morning light, her slender, exposed limbs glowed brightly. The sun, still on the horizon, shone on her skin exposed by the sports bra and fluorescent-colored shorts, making her appear white. Her body posture, soft and supple, accentuated her longtime love of running. Even if she were a long-distance runner, no one would probably believe it.</p><p>"No problem. I've also prepared a homemade oral rehydration solution for Aruha. After all, the sports drinks on the market are high in calories."</p><p>"No, I'm not worried about replenishing my water..."</p><p>"You don't have to worry about the fire either. There's no one and nothing flammable around, you just have to jump into the river in case of emergency."</p><p>"That's too barbaric. I wonder if I still have to run 'I told you to run! Stop talking and start running!"</p><p>I couldn't just stand there and watch her start running, so I reluctantly followed her.</p><p>But I immediately ran out of breath and my head started to hurt.</p><p>It was normal, since I hadn't done any serious exercise other than in PE classes. Although I tried to catch my breath and get the oxygen my body needed, it wasn't enough.</p><p>My head hurt and my feet ached.</p><p>Could I really run like this for an hour? I doubted it.</p><p>It was time to give up.</p><p>This thought ran through my head many times.</p><p>But I didn't give up.</p><p>It was because Ioka's appearance while running was too beautiful. The light reflecting off the nearby river flowed with the sheen of his sweat. I realized that, in order to appreciate true beauty, humans can exert themselves in unexpected ways. But this idea could only hold for a while. Gradually I grew out of breath, my feet refused to obey, my head clouded, my body swayed and my stomach churned. And then...</p><p>"I-I'm going to throw up."</p><p>I threw up at mile 6.5.</p><p>"You're really hopeless. We'll stop here today, even if it's shorter than usual." Ioka said as she looked at me sitting on the grass beside the road, still dizzy.</p><p>"Yeah, sorry..." I nodded weakly.</p><p>No, why was I apologizing?</p><p>She handed me a bottle of oral rehydration solution. The salt and sugar in it played a discordant tune on my tongue. Simply put, it was hard to drink. But, still, it made me feel better.</p><p>"At this level, you're already exhausted, you're not used to the exercise."</p><p>The reason tears started streaming down my face was not because of Ioka's gentle pats on my back, but because of the sheer physical response.</p><p>"No, it's even stranger to run ten kilometers every morning..."</p><p>I tried to excuse myself through tears. Ioka thought for a moment before making up her mind and turning to me.</p><p>"Aruha, let me tell you my secret."</p><p>"What secret?"</p><p>Although there was no one around, she leaned toward my ear and whispered,</p><p>"Actually, I...."</p><p>Her warm breath blew my ears.</p><p>"....I'm very easy to gain weight."</p><p>Ioka told me this as if it were a big secret.</p><p>"In elementary school, I was actually very overweight. So, if I don't run this distance every day, in some parts, I would grow..." she gestured me toward her body, blushing.</p><p>It didn't look like the work of a devil.</p><p>I couldn't help but picture a chubby Ioka. I thought she was cute in her own way.</p><p>"No, no." I quickly replied.</p><p>"Although some people look favorably on having an outstanding figure or loving their own body, I hate my past self. I just followed my parents' instructions and had no hobbies. I ate a lot when I felt stressed. But even now, I still like to eat. I feel like if I let my guard down, I'll go back to my past self."</p><p>She said, nervously ruffling a lock of her hair. It gave her the look of a small animal.</p><p>"A tyrannosaurus rex is not born a tyrannosaurus rex."</p><p>"Who's a tyrannosaurus rex? I'll bite you, starting with your head."</p><p>"I'm not tasty."</p><p>"Seriously...?! I was trying to have a serious conversation! Anyway, it's all because you said you wanted to know more about me ..... you said it was necessary to exorcise the devil!"</p><p>"I'm sorry. I was really startled. I didn't mean to make fun of you."</p><p>I understood that she had only told me in her own way, after she had taken it in herself, and I hurried to explain it to her as I felt nervous.</p><p>With this in mind, I considered the matter of the devil.</p><p>"What about this, is it possible that the desire is not to get fat?"</p><p>"That's a pretty realistic wish."</p><p>"Like, for example, burning calories in the form of flames?"</p><p>"If that's the case, I'll sell my soul for it! Don't exorcise it!"</p><p>"I think a devilish diet is definitely bad for your health..."</p><p>Although I tried to put my idea into words, but thinking about it calmly, there are many things that don't make sense. The most important thing is that she has already successfully lost weight through her own strength.</p><p>Ioka stared at me, who was absorbed in my thoughts, and then faked a cough and slapped my back hard.</p><p>"We've had enough rest and now it's time to stretch."</p><p>"Ugh, no, not at all."</p><p>"I don't care what you think, I'm just care what I think. Next is the stretching exercise."</p><p>"I still feel like this is to be expected? Anyway, I still have to train the muscles..."</p><p>"Yes, but I don't want big muscles, so I'll do it lightly."</p><p>"After being forced to run 10km, it's hard to believe what you call 'light'."</p><p>"You only ran 6.5 kilometers, remember that."</p><p>"That's what you said!"</p><p>After that, I had to do stretching and bodybuilding exercises with her. Soon I collapsed on the ground, my stiff body emitting a mournful sound. Meanwhile, Ioka kept moving smoothly, doing push-ups, planks, squats, stretching exercises and horse stances.</p><p>She was doing all kinds of postures that I didn't know where to look. But I couldn't tell Ioka that. She was working hard to shape her body, and it would be impolite to have strange thoughts about her ..... So I told myself. I had to endure this stage.</p><p>"So, that's it for the morning workout."</p><p>She said when we were done.</p><p>The sun had fully risen.</p><p>"Next, I'm going to go home and take a shower, then have breakfast. See you at school." she said, her tone relaxed but not entirely serene.</p><p>"Um, do you really get that much exercise every day?"</p><p>"Of course. And today I had to stop judo because I was so exhausted."</p><p>"I can't believe you can keep up that pace." I said, impressed.</p><p>Ioka pursed her lips and clenched her fists.</p><p>"My body exists for victory. Every hair and every cell is like that. It's natural to get results."</p><p>The sun that had begun to rise was now shining brightly on the surface of the river.</p><p>And Ioka's posture shone just as brightly.</p><p>To be honest, I was a little surprised.</p><p>I thought all the beautiful things in the world were beautiful from the moment they were born.</p><p>Powerful things are born powerful and brilliant things are born brilliant. That's the way of the world.</p><p>But at least Ioka is different. She is not a naturally strong person. Rather, she has the desire to become one, and through continuous effort, she changes herself. Just as death seeks the best genetic factors, or a burning star burns itself out.</p><p>It is this confidence and self-importance that makes her a strong person. Ioka is not a belonging, but an aspirant.</p><p>Chasing dreams, sounds simple and even clich√©. Wanting to become a big star, wanting to be in a fashion show, everyone says these things. But she is running towards her dream in reality.</p><p>I don't know if Ioka will be able to win the first look. Although I don't know, what is certain is that a devil blocked her way while she was trying to reach her goal.</p><p>I have nothing. No things I like, no things I want to do, no dreams, no hopes. Nothing at all.</p><p>That's why, if Ioka goes forward bravely, I want to become that force. If it's called desire, it's very small.</p><p>She advances confidently in the sunlight, her tall, erect silhouette shining brightly and capturing my attention, making me squint.</p><p>***</p><p>"Well, like I said, no drugs, no rock and roll and very healthy."</p><p>I told Miu the general circumstances, but she opened her eyes in surprise.</p><p>"Aruha, this is strange."</p><p>"Huh? What's strange?"</p><p>"Well, why were you running with Ioka-chan in the morning?"</p><p>It was over. I guess my brain shut down completely.</p><p>From my point of view, I was dragged into the cruel training without knowing why. But being called in the morning and accompanying her in training to the point of vomiting, yes that is really an unusual relationship.</p><p>"I'm going to ask you straight out, are you two dating?"</p><p>"It can't be that simple."</p><p>"But, Noel and Liam, they were only working class in Manchester, but now they're at the top of the charts, aren't they?"</p><p>"Don't say things I don't understand at all..."</p><p>"What I mean is that anything is possible in this world!"</p><p>"Whether we're dating or not, don't talk about superficial things like that! It's not good!"</p><p>"That's not what I'm asking."</p><p>"Then what is it?"</p><p>"Aruha, you're hiding something from me."</p><p>"Uh."</p><p>Well, even I have to admit that I'm not good at lying.</p><p>Although I can't tell her the truth, still, it's hard for me to let Miu worry.</p><p>Anyway, I can only say something that doesn't touch the core but still corresponds to the facts.</p><p>"Well... Sai-san entrusted the matter of Ioka to me. Since it's a private matter, I can't say much, sorry."</p><p>"...Sai-sensei's case? After all, I heard she's on vacation."</p><p>Miu related it to Sai-san"s vacation and seemed convinced. She already knew that Sai-san is friends with my sister, but she doesn't know about the devil investigator aspect.</p><p>However, I find it strange that Sai-san is called "Sai-sensei" and admired by students, when she actually attributes her devil hunting work to me and just eats sushi at the airport.</p><p>"Anyway, Miu, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p>"Well, in that case..."</p><p>Although Miu's lips still twisted, she still found it a little hard to believe. But I no longer had the energy to explain further. I slumped back down on the table, helpless and weak. At that moment, the noisy atmosphere of the classroom suddenly became suddenly silent.</p><p>I raised my heavy head again and saw Ioka standing there with a dignified bearing.</p><p>"You didn't answer me, so I came to see you in person."</p><p>"Ah, sorry..."</p><p>Since I was too busy to look at my phone, I might have missed the message. But did I have to respond so quickly?</p><p>"Go get the clothes after class, go to the bookstore on the way and then to the library."</p><p>"Wait, what did you just say?"</p><p>"One always has to confirm the most recent situation on the scene, because you can't understand the story or comments simply by being online."</p><p>"That may be true, but..."</p><p>"I said I'm leaving now."</p><p>"No, you can't go alone."</p><p>I spoke without thinking, and suddenly I realized something.</p><p>Ioka's eyes showed an expression that was hard to pinpoint, whether it was angry or sad.</p><p>That's right, I couldn't go alone.</p><p>"I understand, I'll go. I'll go."</p><p>"It would have been better if you had said so from the beginning. I'll contact you about the meeting point later."</p><p>She said that coldly, then quickly left.</p><p>"Hey, Aruha. Is Ioka-chan always like this?"</p><p>After she disappeared from my sight, Miu asks me.</p><p>"Well, sort of."</p><p>"Aruha, do you think that's good?"</p><p>Looking at Miu's unusually serious expression, I hesitantly replied.</p><p>"Mmm. It's something I have to do now."</p><p>She thought for a moment with her arms crossed, then grumbled.</p><p>"But if anything happens, please consult me."</p><p>It sounded good to me, but I was sorry I couldn't tell the truth. But, I no longer had the energy to respond, and merely raised my hand in response.</p><p>Anyway, the important thing right now is to take action together with Ioka, and clarify what we both want. Right now it's necessary for both her and me.</p><p>***</p><p>However, things didn't go smoothly. From then on, every day was brutal. We would meet by the river at 5 a.m. and run 10 kilometers before going to high school. After class, we would repeat the cycle of visiting clothing stores, looking at fashion magazines in bookstores, and going to the library.</p><p>From high-end clothing stores to department stores where even I would go shopping, Ioka would go to various places extensively and frequently. She would chat enthusiastically with store clerks and even quietly ask to try on and wear a 300,000 yen coat. Still, none of the sales clerks seemed concerned about it, and many of them seemed happy, from my observation.</p><p>At the bookstores, on the day of the fashion magazine launch, I checked each and every fashion magazine on the rack. Although they say most of them are bought, she insisted that it makes sense to look at them in the bookstore. Regardless of the age group or whether they were men's or women's, she would go through them all and explain to me in detail the parts that impressed her. Honestly, I understood almost nothing, it was almost as if she was talking to herself, so I just nodded and she seemed satisfied. That was enough for me.</p><p>In the library, I stacked thick professional books that I barely understood and took notes as I studied them intently. I never imagined there could be such serious books on clothing knowledge.</p><p>Ioka spends each day in an orderly fashion.</p><p>"It's natural to work hard to get results."</p><p>It was the first time I understood what hard work really meant. It was completely different from my way of life. Having a goal and relating everything to it. Ioka always stood out, and looking at her always left me dazzled.</p><p>So I at least looked into what a devil was.</p><p>I searched books together with Ioka and also the Internet to find out what a devil really was. The books were too confusing for me, and some of them just had the name devil, but nothing to do with devils. At first, I thought it was normal that I didn't find any useful information. Now, looking back, I had no motivation back then.</p><p>Although I had many things I wanted to ask Sai-san, she never answered me. Once, feeling helpless, I went to the university she goes to, but faced with the huge campus, I didn't know where the lecture on the devil was and could only return defeated.</p><p>I wrote down Ioka's possible wishes in my notebook. From the noble to the mundane, I constantly listed things that could be her wishes. The wish list filled many pages. I worked late every day, to the point of falling asleep at my desk.</p><p>24 hours a day I thought about Ioka and the devils.</p><p>This was the first time I had ever been so involved in anything.</p><p>Dreams, goals, things I wanted to do, I had never had any of them.</p><p>But now it was different.</p><p>Expelling the devil is something I must do, it's my desire.</p><p>If Ioka wanted to change, I had to change, too.</p><p>So one night, when I felt helpless, I went for a walk, feeling the summer night air cool my overheated brain.</p><p>Suddenly, I noticed something.</p><p>Until now, I had been thinking about what Ioka's wishes were.</p><p>But maybe I should give some thought to the state she was in when she let out the flames.</p><p>I took notes on my phone.</p><p>- The first time we met on the roof.</p><p>- The empty classroom where we discussed.</p><p>- The clothing store where she argued with Rosy.</p><p>I don't know what happened before that, but if these three have anything in common, what would it be?</p><p>After all, since then she hasn't let out any flames, why is that?</p><p>Maybe because Ioka is getting closer to her desire and the devil's power is weakening?</p><p>Although I don't know the reason for the flames, as long as her wishes are fulfilled naturally, the devil will disappear? could that be possible?</p><p>Just then, the screen of my phone suddenly changed and displayed Ioka's name.</p><p>"Whoa!"</p><p>I couldn't help but shout out loud, and passersby looked at me strangely.</p><p>I adjusted my breathing and pressed the call button.</p><p>"What's wrong, Ioka?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "I passed the third selection."</p><p>"That means..."</p><p>I gasp.</p><p>||&nbsp; "Yes, the next one is the final audition."</p><p>It's finally here, I thought.</p><p>Until now, even if she let out flames, she could immediately realize it and retreat to a place where no one could see.</p><p>But, at an audition, that can't happen. She will definitely be restricted to a place full of people. If she lets out flames, it will be over in an instant.</p><p>"Are you going to go then?"</p><p>I asked just in case. The answer I received was what I expected.</p><p>||&nbsp; "Of course."</p><p>"What will you do?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "Are you serious?"</p><p>"It's because I'm worried. After all, the devil is still attached to you."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Precisely because of that."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "I'll have Aruha come with me."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>||&nbsp; "That goes without saying, who is Aruha to me?"</p><p>I unconsciously stopped in my tracks. The person behind me bumped into me and then glared at me as he continued on his way.</p><p>I bowed my head in apology without a word and put the phone back to my ear.</p><p>"It's impossible, no strangers allowed!"</p><p>||&nbsp; "That's why we'll sneak in."</p><p>"I'm an exorcist, not a ninja."</p><p>||&nbsp; "With inside help, it wouldn't be impossible for a mission."</p><p>"You're mixing too many B-movie terms!"</p><p>Although I made jokes before, I still feel a sense of responsibility. Now that Ioka has passed the selection, she must attend the final audition in person. This has been clear from the beginning. Just as she pursues her ambition to become a model, I, as an exorcist, must achieve the same level of success. Find her desire and exorcise the devil.</p><p>It is because I have not yet achieved this that the situation has developed to this point.</p><p>"... I understand. The important thing is to go to the place of the hearing, and if Ioka releases flames, we must find a way to deal with it."</p><p>||&nbsp; "Right judgment."</p><p>"I hope to get more clues..."</p><p>||&nbsp; "I'll figure out how to get into the place. Goodbye."</p><p>As soon as the voice ceased, the phone disconnected. I don't know if I should say impulsive or not, but she hung up the phone so quickly.</p><p>However, even though I told her that we should find a way to fix it, I still think about this so-called way.</p><p>She's a girl who doesn't know when she's going to release flames and doesn't know how to put them out after she releases them. Protecting her in a place where outsiders are forbidden and keeping it a secret is really a difficult task.</p><p>But that's exactly why this is what an exorcist has to do.</p>
