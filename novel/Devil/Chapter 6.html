<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; The Pattern of Marble is the Depth of the Night</h3>

<p>After the audition, we were rocking on the return train.</p><p>All the candidates after Rosy and Ioka were visibly shocked and had lost confidence.</p><p>Their performances were simply stunning.</p><p>If Ioka had made a single mistake, she would have ended up falling. No, it would have been worse, the devil could have burned it all. But she didn't. Although it's still unclear what her wish is, maybe her willpower prevented the devil, that's what I think.</p><p>Even Shimizu-san, who was so fond of talking and worrying, just said "good job." and said nothing else. Maybe that's Shimizu'-san's gentle style.</p><p>After all, no one knows how the results will turn out.</p><p>Until we got on the train, Ioka didn't say a word. And I didn't know how to address her, so I kept silent as well.</p><p>However, I finally opened my mouth after seeing Ioka's face, who was sitting next to me.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>After speaking to her, Ioka showed a relieved expression on her face.</p><p>"Yes. Still, I was a little nervous before."</p><p>"But, it's over now and that's what matters."</p><p>"Can it be considered good?"</p><p>Ioka looked at me with a worried expression.</p><p>"Well, the catwalk was great and your answers were good too ..... I think."</p><p>"But, Rosy--"</p><p>"The most important thing is that it's good that there are no flames. Seriously, I thought something was going to happen."</p><p>I couldn't help but interrupt Ioka's words.</p><p>"Yes. I thought there would be flames on the way ..... but my body suddenly became lighter..."</p><p>Ioka placed her hand on her thin jaw and plunged into her thoughts.</p><p>"The devil is fulfilling Ioka's wish. Maybe Ioka's strong will to achieve her wish by herself repelled the devil."</p><p>"You mean..."</p><p>"Yes. Why do they have to be flames? We don't know yet. But it definitely has something to do with Ioka's dream. If that's the case, getting rid of the devil is only a matter of time."</p><p>"So, that's the way it is?"</p><p>"Yeah, I guess so. In this situation, I didn't need to be here from the beginning. It seemed strange to me before, why did I become an exorcist...? Seriously, Sai-san..."</p><p>"Aruha!"</p><p>Ioka suddenly shouted, leaving me perplexed. She too had a surprised look on her face and quickly lowered her voice.</p><p>"Um ..... Is that Aruha..."</p><p>"Ioka?"</p><p>The train shuddered nonstop as it crossed the tracks.</p><p>Then it returned to normal and she awkwardly began to speak again.</p><p>"Um, the results will be announced next week. If what you said before is true, the time when the results are announced will be the most dangerous."</p><p>"That's right..."</p><p>I remained thoughtful. I still haven't figured out what her specific wish is. If Ioka's dream goes away, the devil might get stronger quickly.</p><p>"Therefore, when the results are announced, I hope you'll be with me."</p><p>"Understood. I also think it should be done like this."</p><p>I agreed and at the same time had a premonition.</p><p>Maybe this will be my last job as an exorcist.</p><p>***</p><p>The day came.</p><p>In case any emergency happened, we gathered in a square by the river. However, Ioka seemed anxious and restless, pacing nervously back and forth. Thus, we arrived at the big bridge.</p><p>I leaned against the railing and looked up at the sky. The day was growing shorter and the glow of dusk was fading. No one was there and only the twinkling stars were watching us.</p><p>The stars were reflected in the street lamps, glowing orange. They looked like real stars.</p><p>"I guess the phone call will come soon..."</p><p>She seemed unable to bear the silence and said this.</p><p>The results will be transmitted to Shimizu-san, who is the manager, and then Shimizu-san will call Ioka at that time.</p><p>After hearing this agreement, we meet here.</p><p>Ioka's body was tense and her breathing was rapid. Of course, after all the hard work, the results and the future of her life would be decided with a phone call.</p><p>So, she was right there at this important turning point.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Ioka suddenly shouted, and I was startled.</p><p>"Huh? What happened?"</p><p>"It might emit flames."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>I quickly grabbed her hand.</p><p>But it was a cold touch I felt.</p><p>"Looks like the temperature isn't rising..."</p><p>I looked around, but didn't see the shadow of the lizard. Could it be hiding in the dark?</p><p>Although I wanted to let go and relaxed my grip, the touch of it's hand didn't disappear.</p><p>"Ioka..."</p><p>"I'm just teasing you."</p><p>"Let go of me!"</p><p>"But you're worried about me, aren't you?"</p><p>"Since we're already here, it's impossible to escape!"</p><p>She grabbed my hand and closed her eyes, smiling.</p><p>"If I burst into flames after hearing the results ..... I'll drag you down with me."</p><p>"Don't say such horrible things..."</p><p>Although she said it in jest.</p><p>I felt her hand tremble.</p><p>"I am your exorcist. So when that time comes, it will be my responsibility to exorcise the devil."</p><p>"Aruha, I..."</p><p>Just as Ioka was about to say something....</p><p>There was a vibrating sound.</p><p>It came from Ioka's bag. She quickly let go of my hand and frantically pulled out her phone.</p><p>The light from the screen reflected on her face.</p><p>"It's Shimizu-san calling me."</p><p>You could tell she was pale.</p><p>No doubt it was the call to notify her of the audition results.</p><p>"Okay, I'm here."</p><p>After hearing my words, she nodded.</p><p>Ioka pulled herself together and answered the phone.</p><p>She brushed her hair behind her ears and shook her head to get out of the way, then put the phone to her ear.</p><p>"Hello, this is Ioka. Yes ..... Really?"</p><p>Although I could hear Ioka's reply, I couldn't deduce the specific content.</p><p>Soon, her words became fewer and fewer and, finally, she lapsed into silence.</p><p>I watched her with the feeling of falling into an ice cellar.</p><p>The call ended soon and she let go of the phone with a weak hand.</p><p>To my eyes, her gaze had gone unfocused.</p><p>A choked sound came from her throat.</p><p>Her gaze averted and her hands trembled.</p><p>Seemingly about to fall or burst into flames, I held out my hands, ready to catch her at any moment.</p><p>"Um, I..."</p><p>You didn't make it?</p><p>That's understandable.</p><p>Rosy's walk was so overwhelming, after all.</p><p>"Ioka, calm down. This is inevitable, there will definitely be another chance..."</p><p>"Aruha-kun! I....!"</p><p>Ioka suddenly raised her head.</p><p>Her face was close enough that she could feel her breath.</p><p>Her eyes shone like stars.</p><p>"....I've done it! The first look of the fashion show! The decision is mine!"</p><p>She closed her eyes tightly, waving her hands and jumping in place.</p><p>"Fashion show model! I'm a fashion show model! The first look of the fashion show!"</p><p>Ioka kept jumping up and down and repeating the same words.</p><p>"Congratulations..."</p><p>I don't know why she stuttered when she spoke.</p><p>I couldn't decipher what my feelings were.</p><p>Ioka had won, that was a fact. So shouldn't I be completely happy?</p><p>But before I could examine my own heart, Ioka collided with me.</p><p>"Whoa!"</p><p>"Thanks to you, Aruha!"</p><p>After saying that, she hugged me and we started spinning around.</p><p>Her star hair accessory reflected the street light and shone brightly.</p><p>We held hands and spun like stars and planets.</p><p>"No, I didn't do anything..."</p><p>"The result is good, everything is good!"</p><p>She was smiling with a reddened face and I was finally able to steady myself, being shaken by her.</p><p>Soon, my mood also improved. Although I played no role, she achieved her wish with her own strength.</p><p>This way, perhaps we can truly exorcise the devil.</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>It's no big deal, after all, she never needed me in the first place.</p><p>Because she can fulfill her wish with her own strength.</p><p>The exorcist and the devil-possessed, that's our relationship.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a flash of white and it burned my eyes.</p><p>I couldn't see anything, and my brain couldn't react fast enough.</p><p>At the same time, I realized that there was a figure standing there.</p><p>The person was tall, wearing a black coat, a hood and a black mask, so I couldn't see her face.</p><p>This person's appearance was even worse than that of the devil.</p><p>"Is that the stalker?"</p><p>"Aruha!"</p><p>She hid behind me.</p><p>I reached out my hand to protect her.</p><p>That's right.</p><p>We were just photographed.</p><p>I thought desperately about what to do next to protect Ioka.</p><p>However, all my simulations were shattered by an unexpected sound.</p><p>"Yes, it's the stalker."</p><p>The voice was very soft and a little hoarse.</p><p>It was distinctive enough that I couldn't mistake it.</p><p>"Who could it be, maybe it's...?"</p><p>"You two are really playing around, even flirting in a place like this at night. It's all because you're so careless, that's why you've surprised with a picture like this."</p><p>The shadowy figure showed me the phone, on it was a sharp photo of Ioka and me in an intimate position.</p><p>"Well, there's no need to disguise yourself anymore."</p><p>The shadowy figure put the phone away, took off her hood and mask, revealing her face.</p><p>"The correct answer is ..... Everyone's favorite cool high school model, Rosy-chan!"</p><p>Blonde hair that seemed to be tied to the environment and black pupils that glowed.</p><p>"Rosy! You .... were you following me?!"</p><p>Hearing Ioka's furious shout, Rosy didn't panic, but waved her hand cheerfully.</p><p>"That's right. After all, it's hard to see something black in the dark. Even though I've been following you the whole time, you didn't notice it at all."</p><p>I gritted my teeth and gnashed my teeth. She wasn't bluffing, she really had been following us the whole time.</p><p>"Still, thinking she's a stalker who's super aware of you is a little too self-centered, don't you think? In the end, you're just not interested in someone like Ioka, a mass-produced model."</p><p>"Why are you doing this!"</p><p>"Hmm ..... Why?"</p><p>In the darkness, Rosy waved her glowing phone.</p>

<p>"Why are you doing this?!"</p><p>"Haa, why? Don't be ridiculous."</p><p>Rosy's malice poured out like mud, almost swamping me. But still, I couldn't back down now. Because behind me was Ioka.</p><p>"Rosy has always hated Ioka. Ioka has no spark at all. Still, all the good jobs go to Ioka. Even the image of Naratel, which was originally going to be Rosy's. This kind of work, where leftovers are left over, would definitely make anyone angry!"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>I felt my clothes being grabbed tightly.</p><p>"I've always been unable to accept it. Why does Rosy have to lose to such a mass-produced sycophantic model? She's too cunning, a showdown of strength is what it takes!"</p><p>"So you've been following us all this time?"</p><p>"Yes. If Ioka was going to play dirty, then Rosy would also use other means to counterattack. I never thought I'd find the two of you in a situation like this. The photo is great, let everyone see it. Rosy has a lot of friends on Instagram, it would be better to show everyone Ioka's real self."</p><p>She said this with a mischievous smile.</p><p>"If you don't want this to happen, then give the first look to Rosy."</p><p>"This is very strange, it's completely inexplicable!"</p><p>"It's strange that Rosy, who is more talented, wasn't chosen, isn't it?!"</p><p>"This kind of thing..."</p><p>The words I wanted to spit out stuck in my throat like stones.</p><p>(Why?)</p><p>(Why can't I talk back?)</p><p>Argue that Ioka is more talented.</p><p>To say the most important thing I should say right now.</p><p>(But why?)</p><p>With her obnoxious sharpness, Rosy noticed my situation and smiled triumphantly.</p><p>"See? That's it. Even your boyfriend thinks Rosy is more talented. To tell you the truth, you're trying too hard. Because you're too proud of your relationship with that model? You even put on a suit and pretended to be a manager on the scene? There are often people with ulterior motives who approach me like this. But you don't have good judgment. If so, you'd better go out with Rosy."</p><p>"Who would want to be with a high school student...?"</p><p>"Hey? Can you say that again?"</p><p>Rosy cocked her head slightly, pulling her coat off her massive chest to show it off even more.</p><p>I didn't want to look, but my eyes were drawn to her even though my mind was telling me not to. I could see the rounded peaks and valleys of her chest.</p><p>"See? Now do you get it? I'm an adult. I know more things than Ioka."</p><p>Even if I looked away, the image was already etched in my mind.</p><p>"Ah, your face is red. How cute. You see, everyone thinks I'm better, don't they?"</p><p>Rosy reached out her slender fingers to touch me, but at that moment....</p><p>"Don't touch him! ...Aruha!"</p><p>I heard the voice and turned around, and what I saw was a flame.</p><p>It suddenly burst into flames without warning.</p><p>This shouldn't happen. No, why didn't the lizard give any sign?</p><p>Did I miss something? Even in the dark, as soon as it appeared, I should have noticed it. It should have been like this...</p><p>"No, Ioka!"</p><p>No matter how I look at it, this is not the time to think. I have to stop it - no, I have to stop the fire!</p><p>"It's so hot! What? What is this?! Why is there a fire?!"</p><p>Rosy stepped back, using her thin arms to protect herself.</p><p>However, Ioka didn't let her go.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Ioka pounced on Rosy.</p><p>I intervened at the critical moment, blocking Ioka's body.</p><p>"It's, it's hot ..... Ow!"</p><p>Then, suddenly, the flame increased uncontrollably. The heat burned my skin and the light flickered around me.</p><p>I went flying through the air and landed on my butt on the ground.</p><p>"Calm down!"</p><p>The only response to my words was the flame and roar coming out of his mouth.</p><p>This is bad, she can no longer be reasoned with.</p><p>I looked around me. Rosy was lying on the ground.</p><p>The flames were too bright in the darkness, she would soon be discovered by someone. There seemed to be no time to think about the photo of Ioka and me now.</p><p>I suddenly remembered Ioka's words.</p><p>The days when we ran together along the river.</p><p>Every day chasing her dreams.</p><p>--- Only jumping into the river in case of emergency.</p><p>"Ioka, I'm sorry!"</p><p>I collided with Ioka.</p><p>The memory of being discarded by Ioka flashes in my mind.</p><p>I swung my body around the railing and jumped into the river with her.</p><p>A rushing sensation runs through my whole body.</p><p>I hugged Ioka tightly and put my own body on the ground.</p><p>After a fall that seemed like an eternity...</p><p>The hard surface of the water lashes against me.</p><p>In the piercing cold, we plunge into the pitch-black river.</p><p>Like falling into the darkness itself.</p><p>Yet, even so, it still burns.</p><p>The darkness on the surface of the water flickers, mingling with Ioka's flames, forming a marble of blue and orange.</p><p>Heat and cold mingle, and the water flows without boiling.</p><p>Soon, the flames grew smaller.</p><p>It all sounds far away.</p><p>In the water that muffles all sound, the only thing that feels real, is to embrace it.</p>
