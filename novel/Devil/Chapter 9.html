<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Everything my Heart Desires</h3

<p>"I'm sorry, Rosy. Thanks for your help."</p><p>"Yeah, it's okay. I was worried you weren't going to come."</p><p>The day of the fashion show.</p><p>In the end, I ended up heading to Sakamaki Arena.</p><p>After parting from Rosy, I was very distressed. Even until now, I had loitered around here many times. But in the end, I came here.</p><p>I myself am not sure why. But what I can be sure of is that there is still something lingering in my heart. There are things that haven't gone away even after I'm done. If I can witness the elegance of Ioka's performance at the fashion show, maybe I can finally turn these grudges into ashes. I keep these kinds of expectations in my heart.</p><p>The venue of the Total Girls Collection fashion show is very different from what I had imagined. I had seen a fashion show somewhere before, where there were rows of chairs on a black floor and the models walked in the middle, in general, it was very dignified. However, the atmosphere here is .... how should I put it? It's like a festival.</p><p>From people my age to adults, all kinds of people are crowded together. Everywhere there is a bright and lively atmosphere to the extreme. Lots of boxes next to each other, it's almost like a bazaar.</p><p>Because of the crowd and because I had never been to this kind of event before, I didn't know which way to enter and felt lost. Although I thought that, had I known it would end up like this, I would have gone to the concert with Miu earlier, but that thought was nothing more than hindsight. As a result, I ended up contacting Rosy and asked her to pick me up, which is how I got here.</p><p>"If I had known you were coming, I would have brought you with me. Really, boyfriends are so fickle."</p><p>"It's probably more like being open-minded."</p><p>"That's probably the right word."</p><p>For some reason, Rosy said this with a triumphant look on her face.</p><p>Even amidst the hubbub, that low, familiar voice rings out clearly.</p><p>In the direction of the voice, there is a person standing there, broad-chested, good-looking and in a suit.</p><p>"Ah, it's Shimizu-san..."</p><p>"Long time no see, young man."</p><p>Shimizu-san stands next to Rosy and greets her.</p><p>"Rosy. Have you apologized to him, too?"</p><p>"Ah... um... I think so...?"</p><p>"Rosy."</p><p>The deep voice becomes even deeper and as a result Shimizu-san becomes quite intimidating.</p><p>"I-I'm sorry!"</p><p>"No, there's no need to apologize to me..."</p><p>Even if she says that, in fact, leaving aside Ioka, I don't feel like she has any reason to apologize to me.</p><p>"Rosy should pay more attention to the impression she gives to others. Being polite never hurts."</p><p>"Mom never said that to me!"</p><p>"As your manager who supports your modeling career, I'm concerned that you'll be hurt for reasons outside of your abilities, so..."</p><p>Shimizu-san took advantage of Rosy's weakness and spoke for a long time.</p><p>Just as Rosy was reflecting on what he had said, Shimizu-san turned to me.</p><p>"I heard about the photo incident. It was Rosy's mistake, but you also have to be careful. You don't want to damage Ioka's professional career either. Although I won't stop you two from going out, but you must avoid being seen and heard."</p><p>"That's... I'm sorry. But, um..."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"How is Ioka?"</p><p>Hearing my question, Shimizu-san's expression turned to surprise.</p><p>"She hasn't contacted you?"</p><p>"A lot of things happened."</p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p>Shimizu-san puts his hand to his forehead, showing a thoughtful expression.</p><p>"... I think I understand now."</p><p>"What do you understand?"</p><p>"Why are you asking how Ioka is? That girl is perfect. She's like a sharp Japanese sword now. Even I didn't think she could reach this level."</p><p>"That's..."</p><p>"I think, the reason for Ioka's big change must be because of something that happened. And you didn't tell me about it, so it must be related to Ioka's secret, am I right?"</p><p>I couldn't say anything. However, it seems that Shimizu-san had already foreseen it.</p><p>"Well, never mind. I don't want to get to the bottom of it. For now, it doesn't seem to be going in the wrong direction."</p><p>After that, Shimizu-san turned away.</p><p>"Well, now I have to go to the locker room. Will you come with me?"</p><p>"No, I..."</p><p>In any case, I don't feel like seeing Ioka right now.</p><p>If the devil has already been exorcised, it's better for me not to be there. I'd just be in the way.</p><p>"Really? Well, it doesn't matter, but ..... you're worrying me."</p><p>"Worrying?"</p><p>"Yes. Don't be regret, kid."</p><p>Regret....</p><p>The words left by Shimizu-san, settled deep in my heart.</p><p>(I should have felt regret earlier.)</p><p>(Now, nothing can be changed. No, it shouldn't be changed.)</p><p>(She has already reached her goal.)</p><p>(I will witness it with my own eyes.)</p><p>(So, I must return to my original daily routine.)</p><p>(That's all I have to do now.)</p><p>As I struggled with my own thoughts, time flew by. I looked at my watch, with the hands pointing up.</p><p>The fashion show is finally about to start.</p><p>The lights in the venue dimmed.</p><p>The loudspeaker is turned on.</p><p>The screens light up.</p><p>The darkness fills with applause.</p><p>"It's starting." Rosy's voice said in my ear.</p><p>Countless eyes, including mine, were riveted on the runway.</p><p>***</p><p><b>[Ioka's POV]</b></p><p>My first fashion show has begun.</p><p>On the dressing room screen, several colored fluorescent lights are glowing and reflecting off each other. Music and applause can be heard from afar.</p><p>It is almost as lively as a concert, which is the hallmark of the "Total Girls Collection" fashion show.</p><p>Normally, fashion shows are not coordinated with the rhythm of the music and the models walk down the runway with serious expressions, showing elegant clothes. But this fashion show is completely different. The walk is like dancing, and the models walk down the runway with a smile.</p><p>So I also collaborate with this place and let my emotions come out.</p><p>(No, this is a lie. In fact, I couldn't help but get excited.)</p><p>This is certainly an emotion that came from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>Because, my dream is about to come true now.</p><p>There are still 30 minutes left until the show starts.</p><p>I finally put on today's clothes in the dressing room after completing my hair and makeup.</p><p>I put on each garment following the instructions of the fitter. It's natural to undress in front of others, but it's not worth paying attention to this. It's as if no one cares about the nudity of a human model.</p><p>My body exists only to show the beauty of the clothes.</p><p>All the staff here also work for this purpose.</p><p>We are here for something bigger.</p><p>Therefore, we must strive for perfection.</p><p>Whether it be physical condition, skin or the way we parade. After deciding to participate in the fashion show, I made it a point to live for this moment. No, I feel like I have always lived for this moment.</p><p>All the clothes I wore in this show were made in my image.</p><p>After passing the audition, Tezuka-sensei said to me face to face,</p><p>"Ioka Ito's story is Pinocchio."</p><p>It was like a bolt of lightning. I had a premonition and couldn't help but ask,</p><p>"The star pitchfork in your early works was made with what story as the theme?"</p><p>Tezuka-sensei laughed in surprise.</p><p>The answer was, "Pinocchio."</p><p>Tezuka-sensei didn't know that I treasured that hairpin. However, he used the same theme again when he saw me. It was the first time he repeated the same theme.</p><p>I was dumbfounded - could a true designer see through the shape of someone's soul?</p><p>There was also a question I had to ask myself no matter what.</p><p>"Do you really evaluate me as a puppet that can be seen everywhere?"</p><p>"That's true." he said. But he continued, "That's why it's wonderful."</p><p>It's all the work of fate, I thought. This is my story. I am the protagonist. I alone am special.</p><p>Tezuka-sensei said no more. This means I don't need to know more. I looked at the parade designs, felt the story of Pinocchio and interpreted it's meaning in my own way.</p><p>It is a story of using magic to turn a puppet into a human being.</p><p>It is a story of wish fulfillment.</p><p>The clothes I wore during the dress rehearsal fit me perfectly. Of course, it was made especially for me. Originally, this dress would have looked strange on a Total Girls Collection runway show with a casual style. But this is exactly poetic--no, it's my view of the world.</p><p>I also practiced how to walk to match the dress. How to wear the clothes, how to balance my steps. I've mastered it all to perfection. The clothes are already part of my body.</p><p>The chattering of the other models entered my ears and I couldn't help but tense up.</p><p>But I took a deep breath and focused my awareness on my own body.</p><p>The devil is no longer attached to me.</p><p>Nothing can stop me now.</p><p>(Ioka Ito. Concentrate.)</p><p>(Don't worry about the others, okay?)</p><p>I felt a slight pain in my chest.</p><p>My body seemed to remember the heat of that day.</p><p>It all passed.</p><p>(Don't worry now.)</p><p>(It's all right.)</p><p>(Even if Jiminy Cricket isn't here ..... I was chosen as a model and here I am.)</p><p>(My unique and special first look.)</p><p>Once again, I sharpened my awareness. I just need to focus on me.</p><p>But...</p><p>After the tailor dressed me, I couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p>"What is this...?!"</p><p>The staff around me blanched.</p><p>"Sorry, I'll go check it out. Ms. Ito, please wait here."</p><p>"Hey, why did this happen?!"</p><p>Even the calm Shimizu-san, rarely shouted angrily.</p><p>From the moment I put on my clothes, I felt something strange.</p><p>When the tailor put on my clothes, her expression gradually darkened, and after putting on the clothes, her complexion had turned distinctly pale.</p><p>I know, accidents often happen at fashion shows.</p><p>So I considered every possibility.</p><p>That's what I thought.</p><p>"I've said it so many times, be careful when putting on your clothes!"</p><p>"No, from the beginning it's been like this."</p><p>"Since the beginning means when it started! Are you saying something happened?!"</p><p>"No, it should have been put away well after the dress rehearsal? It can't possibly be like that!"</p><p>The voices around me gradually died down.</p><p>The designer Tezuka-sensei made this dress for me.</p><p>In order to convey the story in my heart as the story of the brand.</p><p>All of this, it has been made to pieces.</p><p>The dress that should have come down to the ankles, now only comes down to the thighs. The torn fabric hangs, trailing behind. The neck has been ripped vertically, and the chest is exposed almost to the point where the breasts are visible. Several cuts go through the waist, exposing the side of the abdomen. Even the shoes have been cut in half, giving the impression that I have to walk barefoot.</p><p>"What is this..."</p><p>I feel like I'm about to lose consciousness.</p><p>I become dazed and listen to the chatter of the staff.</p><p>"Is there anything else?!"</p><p>"Is it impossible, they're all custom made!"</p><p>"Find a way to fix it ... it's impossible! There's no way we'll make it in time!"</p><p>"Quick, change the order of the presentation!"</p><p>"No, the announcement has already been broadcast saying that Ms. Ito will be first!"</p><p>"It's better than the appearance of this thing!"</p><p>I wanted to check my appearance being referred to as "this thing" so I looked around for a mirror.</p><p>But for some reason, I couldn't find one anywhere.</p><p>"Ms. Ito, I'm sorry, but we can only ask you to wear this dress."</p><p>I understand that this is an accident.</p><p>(It's okay, it's fine.)</p><p>(No matter what the situation is, it's called being professional if you can complete your work.)</p><p>(The clothes are not to blame.)</p><p>To calm my mood, I began to imagine:</p><p>I am on stage with a torn garment. The audience is silent. Soon there will be a lot of noise. I shouldn't be cursed. Even if there is, it won't be on the spot, but after the end, after the photo is published in the media. I don't know how it will be later. But it will certainly become a laughing stock. I may not be able to get the modeling job again.</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling the body heat.</p><p>(It's all right.)</p><p>(I can cope.)</p><p>(No matter what the outcome is, I can accept it.)</p><p>(That's why I'm here, now.)</p><p>As a signal for the show to begin, music was heard.</p><p>I had known for some time that this song would be used, "When you wish upon a star."</p><p>Take a step forward.</p><p>Walking down the catwalk barefoot, my heart is cold.</p><p>So as not to be pierced by stares, I instill confidence in my fingertips.</p><p>I do my best to take the right steps.</p><p>As soon as I enter the place, the view becomes white and vast because of the lights.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwMUkiLsnfFwfPkVzKgE9u7FtmYm84vsUBhm7lBo9cPB0XbZlKwVwXYU1lu5GKph5bRpzjieKshbF5XOv7_0tPII4eg35Y2wptXth__Zk2BFn7x2REtnEJFyOADxKcWJ9hhVBjI1HSdFaVPxZMavD7KFCp8qcu-e-lkZ16J_yoj2nYFkivWtq9_G7Muw/s908/image(7).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="908" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwMUkiLsnfFwfPkVzKgE9u7FtmYm84vsUBhm7lBo9cPB0XbZlKwVwXYU1lu5GKph5bRpzjieKshbF5XOv7_0tPII4eg35Y2wptXth__Zk2BFn7x2REtnEJFyOADxKcWJ9hhVBjI1HSdFaVPxZMavD7KFCp8qcu-e-lkZ16J_yoj2nYFkivWtq9_G7Muw/s16000/image(7).jpg" /></a></div><p>The next moment, it reaches my ears.</p><p>Not the garbled whispers.</p><p>Nor the mocking insults.</p><p>But the deafening cheers.</p><p>I don't know what happened.</p><p>(Why did it happen?)</p><p>(Why do they keep cheering in this guise of mine?)</p><p>Someone is shouting my name.</p><p>--- "So pretty. So pretty. Really beautiful."</p><p>Praise is heard in the distance, colorful fluorescent wands sway endlessly.</p><p>I was confused. But, the footsteps engraved on my body automatically propel me forward.</p><p>And then, as I reach the end of the catwalk, I put on a perfect smile.</p><p>(This is how it should be.)</p><p>I can see it.</p><p>In the staff seating area, Tezuka-sensei smiles in satisfaction.</p><p>Before I knew it, I had already stopped my steps.</p><p>My body couldn't move.</p><p>(I understood.)</p><p>What everyone sees is Naratel's first look.</p><p>Whether it's me, Rosy or someone else.</p><p>It doesn't matter what we wear, or what steps we take, it doesn't matter.</p><p>The effort is good.</p><p>Thoughts are also good.</p><p>No one will look.</p><p>Things already accumulated and things already sacrificed, everything is meaningless.</p><p>There is nothing at the end of this track.</p><p>I cannot become special.</p><p>In that case, I don't need garments.</p><p>Everything, in it's entirety.</p><p>Everything is fine if everything disappears.</p><p>Ah....</p><p>(Me?)</p><p>(What did you want?)</p><p>(What did I want to become?)</p><p>I can't remember.</p><p>My skin boils in an instant.</p><p>The air stirs.</p><p>Everyone looks at me.</p><p>Hundreds, thousands, no, tens of thousands of eyes, once again, focus on me.</p><p>The music fades away.</p><p>And the flames, they cover everything.</p><p>***</p><p>I couldn't help but gasp in amazement at the sight of her.</p><p>She's so beautiful, I thought.</p><p>If you looked at each part individually, this dress looked as if it had been torn. It had slashes all over it, revealing the white skin underneath. But once you looked at the overall silhouette, even I could see that it had been carefully calculated.</p><p>The song playing was "When You Wish Upon a Star."</p><p>I remembered the story of Pinocchio.</p><p>The naïve puppet who, after suffering all kinds of mishaps, realized his dream of becoming human.</p><p>Here and now, dressed in rags, she walks the runway, showered with praise.</p><p>And then, she will become human.</p><p>This dress, which at first glance looks tattered and torn, but is so skillfully tailored - that is the story of Ioka Ito.</p><p>However, Ioka has a strange appearance. Her face is full of sadness, her expression darkens as she walks, her steps are heavy as lead.</p><p>Then, she stops walking.</p><p>The audience begins to raise their voices.</p><p>I realized something terrible.</p><p>If the designer makes a single miscalculation.</p><p>That's right, she is possessed by the devil.</p><p>I am bound to know it.</p><p>At the worst time, in the worst way.</p><p>I am forced to know that the devil has not been exorcised.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Ioka burst into flames.</p><p>No, it just seems that way.</p><p>The vision is painted white.</p><p>It is no longer a flame.</p><p>It is an explosion.</p><p>The sound of the earthquake hits the eardrum.</p><p>The heavy lights collapse.</p><p>All the crystals explode one by one.</p><p>In the jet-black world, everything burns and smoke fills the air.</p><p>Screams, moans, sobs, earthquakes and chaotic footsteps.</p><p>The flames spread like a tsunami towards the audience seats.</p><p>"Danger!"</p><p>I immediately used my body to protect the person next to me, Rosy.</p><p>The heat burned my body.</p><p>I screamed because of the high temperature.</p><p>"Guh...!"</p><p>Rosy peeked out from under me, letting out a sad cry.</p><p>"Boyfriend, are you okay!"</p><p>"I-I'm fine..."</p><p>"Hey, what's that, is that the work of another devil?! How's Ioka?!"</p><p>I wanted to ask that question too!</p><p>Panic was all around us. Everything was burning and everyone was running around confused.</p><p>In short, this was a disaster.</p><p>If this is what the end of the world is like, then this must be it.</p><p>On the catwalk, flames were burning.</p><p>The light was too bright, I couldn't see Ioka's figure.</p><p>But, she must be in there somewhere.</p><p>However, now....</p><p>"Hey, what are we gonna do?! Is Rosy gonna die here?!"</p><p>(First, I must ensure Rosy's safety.)</p><p>"This way!"</p><p>I grabbed her by the hand and ran in the opposite direction to the entrance.</p><p>From the emergency exit closest to our seats, with the fewest people, I led her toward the exit. Wherever I am, I always make sure to confirm the evacuation route beforehand. It has become a habit of mine. This habit has helped us now, it's really ironic.</p><p>When we finally got out, there were already too many people. Some people were watching the fire from a distance, others were lying injured on the ground. Now that we are here, Rosy is temporarily safe.</p><p>"Rosy! Are you okay?"</p><p>I guess Shimizu-san is also looking for her, he immediately ran to us when he saw us.</p><p>"Shimizu-san, this is so scary! What the hell is going on?!"</p><p>"Don't worry. I'll make sure you're safe. There's no danger here."</p><p>"But what about Ioka, is she on fire?!"</p><p>"That's..."</p><p>My fault.</p><p>This is all my responsibility.</p><p>It is clear what has happened.</p><p>The devil has not been exorcised.</p><p>This is the reality. The truth is as it is. There is no other explanation.</p><p>(But why?)</p><p>(Hasn't your wish been fulfilled now?)</p><p>Then I understood.</p><p>I had to understand.</p><p>I made a big mistake.</p><p>Yes, didn't Sai-san say so? All conditions must be fulfilled.</p><p>There was always someone she wanted to burn to become the first.</p><p>So I came to this conclusion, burn all the obstacles and become the best.</p><p>I had that thought in my mind.</p><p>But that's not the case.</p><p>Because if it were, then...</p><p>(What happened when I met Ioka on the rooftop?)</p><p>"I'll go. I can't wait for the firemen. Rosy, you stay here."</p><p>After saying that, Shimizu-san took off his jacket, revealing a thick chest and a black belt on his shirt.</p><p>"No, I'll go."</p><p>"What are you saying?! What if you get hurt?! This is a matter of life and death. No, let the adults handle this..."</p><p>"No, that's not it. I .... I have something to do!"</p><p>I said that, and then ran off.</p><p>This is the situation I brought about myself.</p><p>So I must be the one to handle it.</p><p>And only I can handle it.</p><p>I have something I have to pass on to Ioka.</p><p>And this time, I must drive the devil away for good.</p><p>Because I am her exorcist.</p><p>***</p><p>"Ugh, this smell..."</p><p>Along with the heat hitting the nose, there was the smell of sulfur.</p><p>The seats in the audience had turned into a mortar.</p><p>Rows of countless seats. Narrow aisles. Everything was engulfed in flames.</p><p>The heat seared the skin, the flames were blinding. Everything was covered in orange flames, even things that should not be able to burn were being consumed by the flames. Debris from the fallen material was scattered everywhere. Just being here, the body was about to catch fire.</p><p>In short, this is hell itself. On the other side, there is a throne of hell stretching from the depths to the front of the stage.</p><p>She is there.</p><p>"Ah, you, Aruha, why..."</p><p>The voice is no longer human.</p><p>The voice is both high-pitched and low-pitched, clear and murky, lively and husky, but it resonates clearly on the fiery stage.</p><p>I personally understand it. It is the voice of a devil.</p><p>"No, don't look at me!"</p><p>And, Ioka's appearance has also changed completely.</p><p>The blackened remains at her feet say that this was once her clothing. Her white shoulders, bulky chest, slim waist and concave belly are exposed.</p><p>No, not all of it.</p><p>Only these retain the human form.</p><p>Scales cover their arms and several sharp spines protrude from their elbows.</p><p>The slender fingers extend unnaturally, forming sharp hooks.</p><p>The thick tail extends to the ground.</p><p>The beautiful hair flows down like waves, reaching all the way to the ground. Several sharp horns protrude from the hair.</p><p>And then...</p><p>Among the flames, golden eyes, still glowing, catch my gaze.</p><p>"Aruha .... I... I have become a devil!"</p><p>She opened her mouth, revealing a forked tongue.</p><p>The figure is neither a lizard nor a tyrannosaurus.</p><p>It was simply that of an evil dragon.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMYhbdbtR5Bqwh-j73NwGJYi6GJxOmcOnlpHv4bf06eA5TAZ-gU6T-ilfffejzf2HicXLbNDQIZ1b_cipHHyE7wS8eHIKCRBYYh3eVrqF5OwtV5Rf8AqOpAmgHrDSQfvU29Zq2PFpJZDs0lO_oeiVezF3QsPDPQdisJ9OduaXgDJSIbaNr4HI1lam8VQ/s908/image(8).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="908" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMYhbdbtR5Bqwh-j73NwGJYi6GJxOmcOnlpHv4bf06eA5TAZ-gU6T-ilfffejzf2HicXLbNDQIZ1b_cipHHyE7wS8eHIKCRBYYh3eVrqF5OwtV5Rf8AqOpAmgHrDSQfvU29Zq2PFpJZDs0lO_oeiVezF3QsPDPQdisJ9OduaXgDJSIbaNr4HI1lam8VQ/s16000/image(8).jpg" /></a></div><p>(Could such a thing exist?)</p><p>(Is this the true form of a devil?)</p><p>(Have I fought against something so terrifying before?)</p><p>I trembled with my own flashback, wanting to run away.</p><p>But, I sealed it deep inside me.</p><p>"Wait, I'll go right now!"</p><p>The flames swirled and churned, and I ran to the dragoness sitting in the middle</p><p>"Agh!"</p><p>However, the flames burst out as if they wanted to block me, and I ran through the pile of debris.</p><p>A barrier of flames was still blocking my path.</p><p>I slowly made my way through it and shouted toward the stage.</p><p>"I ... Ioka!!!"</p><p>It's too far away, out of my reach, I have to get closer.</p><p>However, with every step I take, the flames become more intense.</p><p>I feel like my body is about to burn.</p><p>"Aruha, it's too late, I've burned everything!"</p><p>Every time she shouted, flames shot out of her mouth.</p><p>Explosions were going off everywhere, as if trying to stop her.</p><p>Waves of heat shook the air with each explosion.</p><p>My throat burns, I can't breathe.</p><p>Pain runs through my body.</p><p>Still, I must go to Ioka.</p><p>Struggling to support my body with my collapsed knees....</p><p>I climb the rubble and struggle to reach the stage.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>I opened my mouth and hot air rushed into my lungs. It was hard to say that sentence.</p><p>"Aruha... why... why are you apologizing, everything, everything is my fault! You see and understand, don't you, I'm a monster!"</p><p>"No, you're wrong!"</p><p>"I'm not wrong about anything! This is what I am. I... I'm an ugly woman inside. I can't fulfill any dreams. No one will pay attention to me. So... dreams and so on, it's better not to have them. Being special, I shouldn't have thought like that in the first place! Everything, everything, everything I did wrong. So... so now I'm being punished!"</p><p>"Don't say such things, Ioka!"</p><p>To get closer to her, I took a step forward from the stage.</p><p>Ioka stepped back with her feet covered in scales.</p><p>I turned around and looked toward the audience seats.</p><p>There were about ten thousand people in the audience here until a moment ago.</p><p>Their gazes were focused solely on Ioka.</p><p>But...</p><p>In reality, no one was looking at Ioka.</p><p>Not a single one.</p><p>No, except one person.</p><p>I steeled myself and took a deep breath. The heat and pain quickly spread through my body.</p><p>Still, I had to pass it on.</p><p>"...I should have trusted Ioka more. Even if it didn't make sense and didn't meet all the conditions."</p><p>"C-Conditions...?"</p><p>She withdrew her foot and the scales made a scratching noise.</p><p>"I forgot. On the roof, the day we met. Even though no one was there and there was nothing in the way, Ioka was on fire. That's right. I went up to the roof to confirm what the true identity was after I saw the fire. Do you understand? You weren't burning to burn me, but because you were burning, we met."</p><p>"What are you talking about, Aruha...?"</p><p>Her long pupils widened.</p><p>"Not only do you have to take into account the conditions of flame, but also those of extinction. You spewed flames when no one was looking, when you were hoping someone would understand your feelings. And then, when the flames disappeared, someone was--no, it was me! Watching your heart!"</p><p>"No.... get out of here fast... Aruha!"</p><p>The flames flickered on her hands, legs, tail and horns.</p><p>Clinging to her shoulders, Ioka desperately tried to suppress them.</p><p>Fire is composed of heat and light.</p><p>But all she could see was heat.</p><p>The power to break things. The power to shake, crash and crush.</p><p>But...</p><p>The important thing is the light.</p><p>It is not a flame that devours everything.</p><p>It is a light that indicates where it is.</p><p>That's why I was able to find Ioka.</p><p>That's why I was able to meet her.</p><p>Like a sailor chasing the North Star in the vast ocean.</p><p>Flames erupted from her body, turning into pillars that enveloped her and the stage in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Walls of fire blocked me.</p><p>But that no longer mattered.</p><p>I think Ioka's eyes were probably filled with tears.</p><p>But the tears evaporated immediately, rising like smoke. Even crying is not allowed now.</p><p>"Now you understand."</p><p>Her body might be burning. But the flames were definitely tormenting her heart.</p><p>I must pass it on to her.</p><p>"Answer me, Ioka! What is your wish?!"</p><p>This is my last job.</p><p>"My, wish is...."</p><p>The flames expelled by the devil come straight at me.</p><p>"I.... I want someone to look at me!"</p><p>I broke into a run.</p><p>Not to escape.</p><p>But to run towards the approaching flames.</p><p>The soles of my shoes melted, almost making me fall.</p><p>The flames climbed up my body.</p><p>Emitting the smell of roasting meat.</p><p>The pain was like being burned alive.</p><p>This is a punishment.</p><p>(Yes, it's my fault. I made a mistake.)</p><p>(You were always looking for help.)</p><p>(You were so desperate for someone to notice you, you got to the point of spitting flames.)</p><p>(Still, I was just looking at the devil.)</p><p>(And I had the audacity to say I'm an exorcist.)</p><p>(So accept it openly, Ioka.)</p><p>(No matter how the flames burn me.)</p><p>(No matter how ugly you are.)</p><p>(I'll never look away from you again.)</p><p>"Ioka!"</p><p>"Aruha!"</p><p>Leaping through the flames, I finally catch up to her.</p><p>My open arms finally embrace her.</p><p>(I've always wanted to do this.)</p><p>(I should have done it sooner.)</p><p>I hug her tightly.</p><p>The stone that was dragged by the gravity of the stars, falls.</p><p>Our distance is zero for the first time.</p><p>"I was always alone... If I don't produce results, no one will recognize me.... I thought it would always be like this... So... I..."</p><p>The heat burns my whole body.</p><p>The intensity runs through my body.</p><p>Thick smoke burns my lungs.</p><p>There is not enough oxygen, I am unable to breathe.</p><p>Still, I pull out my last strength and affirm her.</p><p>"I will always look at you, at you, forever."</p><p>Then, everything burns brightly with brilliance.</p><p>The flames engulf everything.</p><p>Then, everything is reduced to ashes.</p><p>The next moment, all the flames are extinguished. It's as if it were magic. No, maybe it was magic. After all, it is the work of a devil.</p><p>Only Ioka and I are left, slumped on the ground.</p><p>And Ioka, trying to help me up.</p><p>When I open my heavy eyelids, Ioka appears, her usual appearance in full view.</p><p>(Ah... how nice....)</p><p>The devil has been exorcised.</p><p>"Aruha... Aruha!"</p><p>Her voice has also returned to the familiar tone.</p><p>I feel, big tears falling on my face.</p><p>(Ah... that's great, I get it.)</p><p>Ioka wasn't burned by the flames, she's crying.</p><p>Even though I want to talk to her, the words become air passing through my throat.</p><p>My whole body aches.</p><p>It's over.</p><p>(Am I going to die?)</p><p>But that's okay. After all, I sensed it would end this way and I was prepared.</p><p>In the hazy white vision, I see Ioka. She is crying as she looks at me. I reach out my hand as I slowly lose consciousness.</p><p>Ioka takes my hand. Her hand is cold as ice, but it makes me feel cool and calm.</p><p>Ah, no. I had promised. To always watch over her.</p><p>So, I must survive.</p><p>(If there are still devils, will her wish come true?)</p><p>I will pay any price.</p><p>My throat emitted an inaudible sound.</p><p>(Save me....)</p><p>But, as I expected, the devil didn't come to save me.</p><p>Just as I was about to abandon my consciousness. In the misty vision, several people dressed in white appeared. Someone held out his hand to me.</p><p>(Could it be? It is not a devil, but an angel coming to greet me?)</p><p>That was the last thought in my mind.</p><p>But soon, I discovered that it wasn't an angel.</p><p>--- "Make way! I found an injured person! Move quickly!"</p><p>I felt my body float, and they lifted me up.</p><p>This feeling, it's as if I had been summoned to heaven.</p>
