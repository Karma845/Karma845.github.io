<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Something Special Just For You</h3>

p>That morning, I was called out of a narrow hallway lined with a large number of doors leading to a strange space. The place seemed to be called a luggage room, and I didn't even know such a place existed, but according to Ioka, it was used for storage and changing clothes.</p><p>Faced with the dizzying array of sights, she strode forward confidently, unlocked one of the doors and stepped inside.</p><p>The room was full of shelves and trunks, and we squeezed through the gaps.</p><p>"Are you ready? Let's follow the script. The selection site is filled with all kinds of people. Although only those who know the location know, no one can remember every person's face. Even an outsider like you won't be suspicious when entering."</p><p>"This is all full of flaws..."</p><p>"But, this is after achieving success. Of course, I can enter normally, but I would have to let you break the reception for you to enter."</p><p>"As an outsider and ordinary high school student, I can't do it."</p><p>"I'll make it possible ..... With this!"</p><p>She said triumphantly and then pulled something out.</p><p>No matter how you look at it, it was a suit.</p><p>"Is it possible I'm going to wear this now?!"</p><p>"Don't worry. I change clothes here often too."</p><p>"That's not what I meant!"</p><p>"If you don't feel comfortable wearing it, I'll help you."</p><p>"That's not the problem here...!"</p><p>I was referring to having to change clothes at such a close distance in front of a girl. But for her, a model, this doesn't seem to apply.</p><p>I gave up completely and followed her obediently.</p><p>First I took off my T-shirt and tight clothes, then I hesitated and took off my pants.</p><p>The two of us were almost within hugging distance.</p><p>I did as she said and, when I realized, I was down to my underwear.</p><p>Anyway, this is too embarrassing.</p><p>I pray that my heartbeat is not heard by her.</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Ioka took a step back and folded her arms, then looked my body up and down.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"It makes me angry."</p><p>"Why?!"</p><p>"Even if you haven't exercised properly, your muscles are well developed."</p><p>Unexpectedly, she ran her fingers across my belly. She traced the outline of my muscles as she moved her hand.</p><p>I held my breath and could barely protest.</p><p>"T-This is ..... sexual harassment."</p><p>"Yes, it is. I got angry, so I'm doing this to you."</p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p>"It's no fun to let you be at ease, so I'll forgive you."</p><p>When she saw my expression, she immediately withdrew her hand with satisfaction.</p><p>"So please put this on."</p><p>In her hand was a tie. From there, I put on the socks, pants, belt and clothes she handed me.</p><p>"I'll knot your tie."</p><p>Without waiting for a response, she moved to my neck and began wrapping the tie around it. We were in a position that was almost like a hug, and I involuntarily impeded her.</p><p>"I-I can do it myself."</p><p>But Ioka frowned at my statement.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"After all, I usually knot my tie myself when I put on my high school uniform."</p><p>"In that case, let me ask you, the suit is British style, the shirt collar is a Windsor collar, the width of the tie is that wide, and the thickness of the fabric is that thick. In this case, what is the most appropriate knot?"</p><p>"So there's more than one way to knot a tie...?"</p><p>"The correct answer is the semi-Windsor knot. I'm a professional, so please shut up and let me do it."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p><p>With no counterargument, I had no choice but to obey.</p><p>As Ioka knotted my tie, my heart was racing.</p><p>When she finished, she looked up, put on my suit and patted my chest.</p><p>"Great, it looks perfect on you, Aruha."</p><p>The dark gray suit felt good to the touch, and even I could tell that the fabric was of high quality. The neatly knotted purple tie also conveys a professional air. But the one wearing the suit is not Ioka, but me.</p><p>"You already look like my manager."</p><p>Ioka speaks calmly with terrifying words.</p><p>"No way, the real manager will come later, right?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"If we meet face to face, I'll be found out!"</p><p>"No, that won't happen."</p><p>"There's no way that's true."</p><p>"As I said before, there is no one who knows the faces of all the people involved. From my manager's perspective, Aruha is just someone from a different organization."</p><p>"I wish I could convince the manager to let me observe."</p><p>"Of course you wouldn't. If that person found out about Aruha, it would be a big problem."</p><p>Hearing this, I feel a shiver run down my back.</p><p>"By the way, where did you get this suit? It's for men, right?" I asked, and suddenly Ioka looked away.</p><p>"Well... how should I put it... I've always wanted to dress Aruha..."</p><p>"You bought a whole suit just for that reason?!"</p><p>"F-For research! As reference material! It's necessary expenses!"</p><p>"When did you buy it? And how come it fits me perfectly, it's a little scary."</p><p>"I can tell just by looking at it."</p><p>She said it in a self-congratulatory way.</p><p>"...Because, I think it looks good on you..."</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"No, I mean, men's suits are made to fit their bone structure! Even I couldn't change that!"</p><p>"But even if you say so..."</p><p>The silhouette reflected in the mirror on the side, looked nothing like me.</p><p>This was the first time I had ever worn a suit. I only wore a uniform to funerals and I have no relatives to attend a wedding. It was strange to me. It looked like a uniform, but the feeling was completely different. The thick fabric was tight around my body, it was like wearing armor.</p><p>Standing next to Ioka, I felt like I had really become a manager.</p><p>Honestly, in terms of feelings....</p><p>I felt that I had become his gentleman.</p><p>***</p><p>Afterwards, we took the train to the venue.</p><p>I thought the popular models would have cars to pick them up. But Ioka, who was sitting next to me, told me that this was only the case for a very small percentage, which surprised me.</p><p>On the train, Ioka was very nervous, to the point that even I could tell. She had a desperate look on her face and was nervously touching her hair accessory.</p><p>"You wear that all the time."</p><p>I tried to ease the tension by asking and Ioka answered shyly.</p><p>"It's the first thing I bought at the Naratel. It was the thing that motivated me to become a model ..... It's like a talisman for me. Since I have to wear a designated outfit for the audition, I'll have to take it off later."</p><p>After hearing that, I understood.</p><p>A talisman. This is probably the most important thing to her, now.</p><p>The place was two stops away from the train station. I couldn't imagine what kind of place it was, but the building Ioka pointed out was more ordinary than I expected, which disappointed me a bit.</p><p>"It's this building here."</p><p>After taking the escalators, we arrived at a clean, white, spacious place, resembling a conference room. There were all kinds of people swarming around, and a unique sense of tension. When I thought that this was what Ioka's daily life was like, I couldn't help but feel that we were in different worlds. As I tried not to look around, we stopped in front of the reception desk.</p><p>"Hi. Can you tell me your names?"</p><p>The woman at the front desk greeted us with a smile. Although her impeccable but not stiff attire seemed to make me feel inferior, I straightened my back and expressed to her that today's me wasn't inferior to her. She carried some lists in her hand.</p><p>"I am Ioka Ito, audition participant."</p><p>"Very good, Ms. Ioka Ito, and this is the manager, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>I answered in a voice as low as possible.</p><p>"The waiting room is Room B. The manager can't come in, please note that."</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>After replying quietly again, the receptionist let us through, which was easier than I imagined. Ioka looked at me and blinked.</p><p>Just when I had relaxed, I was called back.</p><p>"Ah, wait, please."</p><p>I turned around with a pounding heart and faced the reception. A cold sweat poured from the space between my suit and my back.</p><p>"W-What's wrong?"</p><p>"Please give me your business card."</p><p>Ioka and I made eye contact.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I don't have a business card..."</p><p>"Oh, that's okay as long as you have the manager's."</p><p>The receptionist said this with a slightly surprised tone. I later learned that models don't usually carry business cards.</p><p>What should I do now? It looks like the following.</p><p>"Unfortunately, I ran out of business cards."</p><p>"Oh, I have one. That'll do, won't it?"</p><p>I understood that she was acting using a cheerful tone.</p><p>"Okay. Mr. Shiito Shimizu, right? Please come in."</p><p>We went through the reception, walked around for a moment and then confirmed that there was no one around to finally relax.</p><p>We both breathed a sigh of relief simultaneously.</p><p>"Haa... That was close."</p><p>"I don't normally do this. Apparently this time it's a little strict."</p><p>"Does that mean it's that important this time?"</p><p>"You can interpret it that way."</p><p>She said that quickly not looking this way. Her eyes constantly looking around seemed very impatient.</p><p>"... Are you nervous?"</p><p>"I'm not nervous at all. Auditions are like three meals a day."</p><p>"You mean it's like a normal meal...?"</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh bitterly. Even my words were disjointed, but I still tried to act tough.</p><p>"Don't worry. If there's a problem, I'll think of something."</p><p>"Even if you say that ..... Will I be selected?"</p><p>"You've worked hard to get here, haven't you? You don't look like Ioka."</p><p>"Thank you, Aruha..."</p><p>"Shh!"</p><p>I put my index finger to my lips, stopping her. Ioka was startled and closed her mouth. She made such a mistake, she seems to be quite nervous.</p><p>"... Ioka, you are like a tyrannosaurus rex. No problem, you will win."</p><p>"Are you paying me a compliment?"</p><p>She pouted, puffing out her cheeks.</p><p>"I'm trying to pay you a compliment."</p><p>Hearing this, Ioka smiled. It seemed that the tension in her body finally relaxed a little.</p><p>"Really, you're someone who doesn't know how to cheer people up ..... But thank you very much. I feel like a lot of things don't matter anymore."</p><p>"Is that good...?"</p><p>"Yes, probably. I think Shimizu-san will be coming soon. Let's not be too close to each other. Let's separate here."</p><p>"Understood. Let's do it."</p><p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Slowly, she lowered her raised shoulders and then looked up at me with a smile.</p><p>"I'm leaving."</p><p>"Okay. Have a good day."</p><p>Ioka walked in a straight line toward the waiting room.</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Then, at that moment.</p><p>"Hey, you."</p><p>I was tapped on the shoulder.</p><p>I turned around and saw a tall man standing there. He was wearing the same suit as me and a square leather bag. He was tall and had a thick chest, and when I looked over his long pants, his strong chest was waiting for me. He looked very refined, to the point of contrasting with his rugged physique. His shiny hair was clean and well groomed. Is he a model? No, this should be for women only.</p><p>I wonder if this person is...</p><p>"Excuse me, may I ask who you are?"</p><p>"Who am I? How interesting. Your face is really thick, isn't it?"</p><p>His deep voice and refined appearance were extremely incongruous. Then he quickly extended a hand.</p><p>He held a business card between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>"I am Shimizu Shiito."</p><p>***</p><p>"Then, there are some things I need to ask you."</p><p>I was ushered into a room resembling a conference room by this person, the actual manager of Ioka. Then, he quietly urged me to sit down with gestures.</p><p>Under pressure, I had to obey.</p><p>"Well, this is a matter with hidden intentions."</p><p>"Young man, I'm the one asking the questions here, what's your name?"</p><p>"My name is Arihara Aruha..."</p><p>"Your false identity by being caught here has been exposed. I checked at the front desk. I should have called the police."</p><p>He spoke like a detective investigating the case himself.</p><p>"I'm very observant. From your appearance, you are a high school student, and you attend the same school as Ioka. At first I suspected you were a stalker, but the situation seems to indicate that Ioka cooperated with you willingly. Although I don't know the purpose, are you and Ioka quite close?"</p><p>"No, this is..."</p><p>Shimizu-san sat down across from me. His dazzling gaze made me squint.</p><p>"I already said I'm the one asking the questions. What's your relationship with Ioka Ito?"</p><p>"Huh? Uh, what kind of relationship...?"</p><p>I didn't know what to answer. It wasn't because of the pressure, but because I really didn't know.</p><p>Even if I couldn't say it was the relationship between a 
  
's host and an exorcist - but then, what kind of relationship is it?</p><p>Shimizu-san probably thought I was trying to deceive him, so he leaned forward and said:</p><p>"Ultimately, I just want to know one thing."</p><p>The devil's business shouldn't be revealed. This man probably has the power to influence Ioka's work, if he finds out that Ioka sometimes bursts into flames, he will ruin everything.</p><p>But I'm not good at lying. If I say anything strange, it will be immediately exposed.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>However, he asked me a question I wasn't expecting.</p><p>"That little girl, is she all right?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Does Ioka sleep well? Does she eat well? Is she bullied at school? Does she have any worries? You must know her personality very well. Even though I've asked her countless times, she never tells me anything..."</p><p>As he spoke, his voice was becoming choppy with tears.</p><p>To me, he sounded like a dying goldfish, constantly opening and closing his mouth.</p><p>"You're like a mom..."</p><p>"Mom? If she lived with a guardian, I wouldn't have to worry so much..."</p><p>Inwardly, I was puzzled.</p><p>This person was too worried.</p><p>I finally understand what Ioka meant when she said, "If my existence is exposed to this person, it will be a big problem." - But the meaning was completely different from what I thought.</p><p>"I'm sorry, it's not appropriate for me to talk about Ioka's affairs."</p><p>"It's like this ..... I see..."</p><p>Although his face was expressionless, I could tell he was disappointed. He was truly a peculiar person.</p><p>After a brief silence, Shimizu-san spoke.</p><p>"I think that little girl has been worried about something."</p><p>My heart, which had just calmed down, froze completely as if it had frozen instantly.</p><p>"Do you know something?"</p><p>"N-No, I don't know."</p><p>"It sounds like you do know."</p><p>"Uh..."</p><p>"But, can't you tell? Then, it's not a work issue, but a personal one."</p><p>I couldn't respond. This person wasn't just someone who liked to worry, he was someone who could understand the subtlety of things. Whatever I said, I would dig my own grave, and there was no way I couldn't reveal information to him.</p><p>If he found out that Ioka was in a state where she could release flames at any time, this worried manager would prioritize his safety, which was the right thing to do. Although it was the right thing to do, the result would be Ioka losing her chance.</p><p>After Shimizu-san sighed deeply, he lowered his eyebrows like swords.</p><p>"It's always seemed to me that Ioka's behavior has been strange lately? Have you seen the styling manual?"</p><p>He asked suddenly. I quickly extracted that word from my memory.</p><p>"You mean the product catalog?"</p><p>"Originally, it was decided that Ioka would be the model for the styling manual, and she was also scheduled to appear on the cover. But since then, her condition has been increasingly slumping at official shoots. As a result, Rosy was urgently appointed as the cover model. Apparently, I really care about her too, so I've been wondering if she's forcing herself to do something .... After all, that girl always puts on a brave face..."</p><p>The content of the conversation made me pay attention. I didn't even know something like that had happened, and Ioka didn't mention it at all. If that was the moment the devil possessed her - what does Rosy have to do with all this?</p><p>"Well, I'm a little relieved, young man. Ioka still has someone like you by her side. But, this makes me worry in other areas... like gossip magazines... hmm..."</p><p>"Y-You worry so much about Ioka!"</p><p>I interrupted his thoughts and forcibly changed the topic that was going in the wrong direction.</p><p>Shimizu-san looked slightly surprised, then slightly softened his expression.</p><p>"Modeling is a cruel job. People are often evaluated and selected based on their looks. Even if you work hard, there may be no reward. Only those who catch the eye for a moment are chosen. And those who are not selected are dropped. No one takes responsibility for this."</p><p>Shimizu-san stared at the ground, his eyes seemed to watch ants carrying cicadas.</p><p>"So, in order to prevent them from regretting what they experienced, I at least expect them to make the best of it. And making that happen is my job."</p><p>I didn't know what to say, so I remained silent.</p><p>I could only think of one thing.</p><p>At least Ioka is lucky to have a friendly manager.</p><p>"So, keeping track of Ioka's social connections is also part of my job. I'd like to know more about you, young man. Are you good at sports? How are your studies? What are your hobbies? What kind of girl do you like? When you take a shower, where do you start washing?"</p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p>I let out a scream as I was forced to answer these questions, but then Shimizu-san suddenly ended the interrogation and looked into the empty space.</p><p>"... Well. Looks like it's about time."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>A few seconds later, there was a knock at the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Hearing the answer, the head that appeared through the open door was-- Ioka.</p><p>"Shimizu-san, it looks like you're about to start ..... Huh!"</p><p>She looked surprised, and looked at both me and Shimizu-san's face with a confused expression.</p><p>"Ioka, if a friend comes to visit you, please tell me. It's your fault, I was shocked."</p><p>"Uh, yeah, right. So, um..."</p><p>Ioka stared at me with confusion in her eyes. Understanding what she meant, I slowly nodded my head.</p><p>"Instead, are you okay Ioka? You look pretty tense."</p><p>Shimizu-san noticed Ioka's state and stared at her with a worried look.</p><p>Ioka, who was wearing a white T-shirt and denim shorts, was clearly losing her composure.</p><p>"Relax. Are you hungry? There are rice balls and sandwiches here. And the air is a little dry, so first you'd better take a throat lozenge, it's very effective. What drink do you want? I only have room temperature drinks with me, if you want something cold or hot, I can go buy it."</p><p>"No, no, that's fine."</p><p>He seemed to have a pocket dimension, constantly taking things out and placing them on the table. Seeing this, Ioka quickly reached out his hand to stop him.</p><p>"Is that so? Well then ..... where's Rosy, is she still in the waiting room?"</p><p>"She's already gone ahead."</p><p>"That's very typical of her. I'll go now, you go ahead too."</p><p>Despite being worried about my situation, Ioka turned around and headed toward the venue.</p><p>Shimizu-san, who had stayed behind, put away the things he had taken out earlier and gestured toward the door with his thumb.</p><p>"Well then, we should get going too, kid."</p><p>"Uh, where to?"</p><p>"Where else? To the venue."</p><p>"But, I'm not a relevant person..."</p><p>I was surprised. I thought that since my intrusion had been exposed, the mission had failed.</p><p>"What you should be worried about now is Ioka's performance due to her nervousness. From the way she looked before, she'll probably feel calmer when she sees you. Or is it...."</p><p>Shimizu-san paused and gave me a sharp look.</p><p>"...Do you think it's better for her that you're not around?"</p><p>The answer to that question is not something I can decide.</p><p>However, what I should do is already decided.</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes later, Shimizu-san took me to the audition site.</p><p>The pure white room had many tables, all facing the empty space in the center. Many people were sitting in the chairs flipping through papers in their hands.</p><p>Shimizu-san and I were in a corner at the back. Several men in suits were standing next to us, I didn't know if they were managers or other related staff.</p><p>The audition participants sat in the chairs arranged in rows. There were six of them. They were all dressed the same as before, in white T-shirts and jeans. This attire mercilessly exposed their body shapes. I finally understood why Ioka had to run every morning.</p><p>Even though they were far away, Ioka's stiff expression could be seen. Her shoulders tense, her hands on her knees clenched tightly.</p><p>Next to her, Rosy was sitting cross-legged. Unlike Ioka, who looked nervous, she was calmly looking at her nails and humming to herself.</p><p>The place was crowded, but silence reigned. The air was charged with a sense of tension, as if a storm was about to hit.</p><p>This was a place where people were evaluated and judged. Showing what one had learned, understood and felt to many professionals, being seen through and then eliminated.</p><p>I felt it personally, how scary was the world in which Ioka wanted to win.</p><p>If I were her, I would also make a pact with the devil.</p><p>Such a hard and scary path of youth, it was something she chose for herself.</p><p>In that case, I should do everything I could for Ioka.</p><p>I looked around the place again.</p><p>Ioka and the other candidates were sitting in the opposite corner of the room. If I were to save her, the judges wouldn't lose sight of my presence. Even if no one thought of devilish possession, withdrawing from the audition midway would certainly affect the selection process. Not only that, I would probably be eliminated on the spot.</p><p>In my backpack, I carried a fireproof tarp. My plan was that, if it burst into flames, I would cover it with it and then quickly escape through the emergency exit to the outside. Clinging to the hope that, even if I couldn't put out the fire, I could at least buy some time before it spread.</p><p>To act smoothly if this situation ever arose, I had simulated it many times in my mind.</p><p>If it ever came to pass, I would have to abandon the mission to save the general.</p><p>I prayed to God that it wouldn't come to that.</p><p>After a while, the auditorium quieted down and became solemn.</p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I am the chief designer, Teruta Tezuka."</p><p>The first person to stand up and introduce himself was a nondescript man. He wore a plain hairstyle and dull clothes. He wore black-rimmed glasses, a white shirt and gray pants. I had imagined he would be a more distinctive person, so I was surprised at how different he was from my expectations.</p><p>"Narrative Tale - perhaps the name "narrative tale" is more familiar to everyone. We participated for the first time in the Total Girls Collection. As you all know, this is the final audition to select the model who will do the first look. Everyone here has gone through a rigorous selection process and succeeded. Please have confidence in yourselves."</p><p>The designer looked at the candidates and continued speaking.</p><p>"The concept of Narrative Tale is 'a story that belongs only to oneself.' It's not about the clothes themselves, but about the stories that exist in the lives of the people who wear them. I have always followed this concept in my designs. I look forward to seeing each of you showcase your unique stories."</p><p>Although her appearance was nondescript, her voice was deep and resonant.</p><p>She commanded the room with exceptional presence.</p><p>"That designer is a genius." Shimizu-san whispered to me.</p><p>"He doesn't look like one."</p><p>"He has a poker face. He's the kind of guy capable of doing anything to express his ideas, regardless of common sense. Without such a character, it wouldn't be possible to develop a new brand at this level in a few years. Okay Ioka... Rosy..."</p><p>I couldn't help but feel a sharp pain in my chest.</p><p>Shimizu-san is the manager of both Ioka and Rosy, and he really cares about them and hopes they both finish the audition successfully.</p><p>But I am different...</p><p>I want Ioka to win. She has to.</p><p>Soon, the presenter called out the names of the candidates.</p><p>The first to be called was...</p><p>"Rosamond Roland."</p><p>The one who was called by name responded in a childish manner.</p><p>"Here! Starting up with Rosy!"</p><p>"Then, please start the walk."</p><p>She confidently jumped into the center of the room and stood there in silence for a moment.</p><p>Just as the people around her began to wonder what she was doing....</p><p>Rosy spun on her heels and looked the other way.</p><p>This unexpected movement surpassed everyone's imagination.</p><p>With this action, she attracted all eyes.</p><p>She wrapped the eyes around her like silk threads.</p><p>After licking her lips, Rosy left her original place.</p><p>I couldn't believe my eyes.</p><p>This is what a fashion show looks like.</p><p>As soon as she stepped forward, the world changed.</p><p>This is no longer a conference room, but a catwalk, with the whole audience, and she is wearing a luxurious dress. The lights are dazzling and the music is melodious. Only in the dozen seconds she walks down the catwalk.</p><p>I really experienced all this.</p><p>Everyone was captivated, and no one said a word. Even the designer could only watch without looking away.</p><p>At that moment, only Rosy was the center of the world.</p><p>Soon, when she finished walking down the runway, thunderous applause broke out.</p><p>Was it real applause or just an auditory hallucination caused by the strong impression? I couldn't tell.</p><p>Even when Teruta Tezuka, who had been watching the scene, spoke softly, I was still stunned.</p><p>"Ms. Rosamond Roland Rokugou. I have a question for you. ...In this audition, the protagonist of the next story is chosen. The power you possess in your story must be expressed in the clothes you make. So my question is..."</p><p>I couldn't sense any emotion in his voice. I couldn't tell what he thought of Rosy's fashion show or what mood he was in when he asked the question.</p><p>But because of this, the question stood out even more clearly.</p><p>"What makes you so special?"</p><p>No sooner had he asked the question than I saw a black shadow next to the designer's feet.</p><p>Although I prayed it wasn't, I took a good look.</p><p>Sure enough, it was a black lizard. The lizard deftly moved through the crowd, climbed up Ioka's toes, crawled up her snow-white thigh and slipped into her pants at the bottom hem.</p><p>She pursed her lips, clenched her hands and looked like she was trying to restrain herself. Sweat dripped down her forehead. Other models looked around, perhaps feeling uncomfortable at the sudden change in temperature.</p><p>"It's a natural thing. I don't have to think about it. Rosy is Rosy. No one else can be the leading lady in my life."</p><p>Rosy's voice, responding that way, sounded distant.</p><p>"I see." the designer said in an indifferent tone.</p><p>After that, the presenter uttered the next name....</p><p>"Ms. Ito Ioka."</p><p>The girl called by name raised her face.</p><p>(Oh, no....)</p><p>(I must get her out of here immediately!)</p><p>Even if the hearing is ruined, there's no other way. I have to keep her from burning on the spot and starting a fire. After all, one wrong step could lead to ..... someone's death.</p><p>But my body, which wanted to run over there, couldn't move.</p><p>Because Shimizu-san was holding me tightly by the shoulder.</p><p>I looked back and shook my head slightly.</p><p>He doesn't know anything about the devil's work or the flames, he just stops me for my suspicious behavior.</p><p>His eyes told me he was also worried about Ioka.</p><p>(No, I can't do this.)</p><p>I understand that Ioka has overcome many difficulties to be here. I cannot rob her of her chance and make her lose without a fight. I can't take this opportunity away from her, even if my judgment is wrong.</p><p>If that is the case, there is only one way to overcome this difficulty.</p><p>I stopped moving and Shimizu-san let go of my shoulder.</p><p>My gaze returned to Ioka.</p><p>She, too, was silently looking this way.</p><p>In her pupils there was a glint of uncertainty and uneasiness.</p><p>To gather her scattered concentration, I stared at her.</p><p>(Ioka, I still don't know what your wish is. But whatever it is, you have come this far on your own.)</p><p>(Please don't sacrifice these things for the flame.)</p><p>(Please don't lose to something like the devil.)</p><p>"...Ms. Ito Ioka?"</p><p>The host, noticing that she didn't respond, spoke her name again, confused.</p><p>She took a deep breath, then answered clearly.</p><p>"Here."</p><p>I thought she would expel flames. But Ioka stood upright, walked forward alone, facing everyone.</p><p>I couldn't sense any hesitation in her posture.</p><p>Ioka stared at me for a moment.</p><p>She flashed a smile that only I knew.</p><p>Then, she began to walk down the catwalk as instructed.</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>Her steps were sharp and polished like the edge of a razor.</p><p>They were the result of continually practicing the same movement, without unnecessary boasting.</p><p>This stiff walk didn't show any great performance, but the effort I had witnessed from her, or the life of which I was unaware.</p><p>This walk contained all that.</p><p>The food she ate, the sights she saw, the knowledge she learned, and the understanding of her body. Most importantly, the passion that burned and gave her life itself.</p><p>Everything she accumulated day by day and month by month was embodied in her. Every hair, every cell, was at the service of victory.</p><p>Ioka seems beautiful to me, not because of the way she looks, but because of the way she lives.</p><p>I noticed that the shadow of the lizard had disappeared at some point. There wasn't a drop of sweat on her forehead.</p><p>The efforts accumulated so far, the determination to win, the confidence that she would never lose. If these things supported her, perhaps Ioka could even overcome the devil?</p><p>In the end, she finished the parade without emitting any flames.</p><p>After returning to its original position, I finally came to my senses.</p><p>The auditorium was still silent.</p><p>Shimizu-san, next to me, said nothing and covered his mouth in thought.</p><p>Rosy was frowning and glaring at Ioka fiercely.</p><p>Then the designer, who had witnessed the whole event, asked the same question as before.</p><p>"Ms. Ioka, let me ask you too, what's so special about you, why do you think you should be selected?"</p><p>Fortunately, there was still no sign of the lizard. I focused on Ioka's answer.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>However, her words stopped.</p><p>The room fell into an icy silence.</p><p>I clenched my fists.</p><p>(If prayers really existed, then this must be mine right now.)</p><p>After a moment, she took a deep breath and looked directly at the designer, speaking again.</p><p>"I guess maybe I'm not special. I'm just an ordinary girl who can be seen anywhere...."</p><p>The whole room was listening to her words.</p><p>"....But because of this, I want to become special - not just someone who can be seen anywhere, but someone who cannot be replaced. That's why I've worked hard so far. And now I'm here. In that sense, I'm still not a main character or a special person. I'm just someone who thinks this way..."</p><p>Her voice gradually lowered and in the end, it was barely audible.</p><p>"Um... I don't know if I answered the question right..."</p><p>The room fell silent. But I saw it.</p><p>The designer sketched a faint smile.</p><p>I was sure the audition had started and ended here.</p><p>And then, time pushed us toward an unknown outcome.</p>
