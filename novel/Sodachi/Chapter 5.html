<h3><b>Chapter 5</b></span></h3><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, onii-san."</span></span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you think about the teacher's sexual harassment?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The TV shows I watch are really bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At ten o'clock in the evening state-owned TV stations often broadcast the latest news or current social issues.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it was in front of Hinata, I thought of pretending to tune in to the station for this, but the news program broadcast the special feature &#8220;Risks around young people ~ teacher morality is questionable&#8221; which became a &#8220;hot spot&#8221;. A little too nervous to change platforms in a hurry, but the results are even worse. A special feature shows that male teachers do some perverted things to their female students, which is not uncommon these days. Hinata's question naturally arose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's been a lot lately,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya pretended to be calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;How pathetic, of course it has nothing to do with me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Do you have anything like this, my brother?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What about the other schools in the district? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tokyo has a population of over 10 million. The area where Mominoki Private Academy is located is one of the few areas in Tokyo known for its population. It hosts a population equivalent in size to the area, with the appropriate number of schools, teachers and students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya replied with a gloomy expression, "Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, so that's how it is. Sure enough, there is. How many?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya got up from the sofa and left the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It took quite a while to complete. By the way, I also clean the toilet. By the way, I looked in the mirror to adjust my appearance. Since I haven't shaved for a day, the color around my chin is getting very dark. Tatsuya was determined to take the time to shave today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Back in the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The news program continues.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata turned from the sofa and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey onii-san. Reportedly the problem of prostitution can happen to anyone. Since schools are still closed societies, these things are more difficult to surface.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course. By the way, I'm going to take a shower. "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya left the living room again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He turned and left a sentence before closing the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;It is getting late and it is almost time for you to return.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It took a lot of time to shower.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wash my body more carefully than before. Gently apply the conditioner evenly to his hair, soak in the tub and hum a song, and take the time to shave while he makes up his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The news program finally ended.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Hinata was still there, not only there, but even saying such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Onii-san, did you really lust for a young girl before?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Didn't I say it was getting late? Hurry back to your apartment."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Get a can of beer from the fridge.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't toy with you even if you beg me? This question is too sensitive. I can't answer it casually."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't say it was normal&#8212;?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata rolled her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Leaning behind the sofa,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I am still a junior high school student, and I am still growing very fast. This is a topic that is closely related to me. It is better to say that I am the party involved.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then so am I."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that, Tatsuya lifted the beer can and took a sip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And then I've said it many times, it's a sensitive question. I'll talk about it another time. It's too late, and I'm not ready to answer you properly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220; &#8220;I wasn't ready or something&#8221;, do you think this was an excuse for not telling me? Refusing to participate in conversations with students is a problem for homeroom teachers, right? I'm worried now, so it's great that you should answer me now&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the moment he took out the beer and drank it to this moment, he had practically given up his resistance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Difficult to answer, very difficult"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya sat on the sofa next to Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He took another sip of beer. This is definitely a rare bath beer, supposed to be an incomparable nectar, but now only a bitter and astringent taste remains on the tip of the tongue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I told you before, Hinata"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What I'm going to say next is just my personal opinion. If I mention it to other people, it will be troublesome. Got it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm&#8212;, but now, let's be adults, shall we? It's like trying to guide a young child."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Just that. You're not going to tell anyone what I'm going to say next."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I won't tell anyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a secret that only you and I know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. A secret that only my brother and I know. Hehe&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata smiled stupidly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm in a very good mood. Ever since that embarrassing news program started, Hinata has been attacking me inexplicably, with an aura that gnaws at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be better if this flow was changed. Without reading further, let's answer the question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The first?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya raised his index finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Teachers are human. Students are human. There are men and women. It has nothing to do with being an adult or a child. Not one or two people, but hundreds or thousands of people. What happened in this case? That is, as the number of contacts continues to increase, unexpected situations will occur more frequently. So, what will happen?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry onii-san. The second part of the sentence is too difficult for me to understand"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In short, if What will happen if things are out of human control, and various situations occur in various places?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What happen?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Made a mistake."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya confirmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata still didn't understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;All kinds, all kinds. Things that can't be tolerated. Punch and kick, steal or be stolen, fall in love, and finally someone dies. But it's a common thing. This has nothing to do with school or getting out of school. But if it really was at school, this kind of thing would be the worst thing to happen, but even so, it would still happen. Do you know why?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">" ...Why ?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because it's human"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is also an affirmation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Humans are creatures who make mistakes. There is no human collective that cannot make mistakes. Even if you can make efforts to reduce the error, the error itself cannot be eliminated. In the final analysis, the accumulation of faults is the essence of life."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm... I don't really understand."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't worry, I don't understand either. But I have more life experience than you, so I vaguely have this kind of intuition. I felt it myself. In short, making mistakes is like this. It won't work if you don't make this an excuse. ."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Tatsuya, who agreed to this, was of course annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He is also a teacher. If it was in a place where comrades and guardians could hear, he would not say so. Because if he said it in front of them he would be killed. Unfortunately, however, this conclusion is true, and because it is true, it cannot be simply dismissed. Just because you're an educator, you can't let go.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In short, people make mistakes, and sexual harassment is included in those mistakes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The beer is gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya walked over to the fridge. Pooh, I opened another can on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Preventing problems before they happen is very important and deserves it, but even so, you can't make mistakes go to zero. Listen, this is absolute, it's absolutely impossible for errors to be zero. Based on this, make as much as possible there is no escape from your hard work."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata hugged her&nbsp;arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She got up from the sofa and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Since this topic is a bit difficult, may I do some gymnastics?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Why gymnastics&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did the first set of radio gymnastics. One two, one two. Hinata carefully stretched her entire body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, I'll be listening, so keep talking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;You, do you really want to hear it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Think! I am different from you, onii-san. Make the best of your efforts on the premise that people will make mistakes, so what should you do next?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How to..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya wanted to complain with all his strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do your best not to make mistakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And the opposite is happening now. Especially the well-developed junior high school students, in a state of coexistence with adult men, exposing their delicate limbs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not just the body. Hinata wore a T-shirt that was too tight for her growing body, and shorts that exposed her thighs. There was no man who did not respond to this. Except for old people who have run out of light and little children whose hair hasn't grown yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I can't say it, I still want to say "Can you pay attention to a place like this".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't surveillance just a matter of caution?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya said calmly, looking away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Be as thorough as possible, as carefully as possible. Keeping some safeguards in place to avoid making mistakes is the only way to continue this down to earth approach. It is important to leverage external forces, and it is important to ensure transparency. Be accountable. Regulatory bodies even need other bodies. to supervise. If there is an emergency, this approach may be necessary."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is this what they call silence?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">always like this</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata spread her legs and pressed her chest against the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her body was very flexible since she&nbsp;was a child. Also recommended by people to learn ballet and skating. If you take it seriously, you may be able to support yourself by performing acrobatics.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Always feels very inconvenient"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. It's very troublesome"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In the end, this kind of sexual harassment won't go away, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it can be reduced"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it can't go away?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mutual compromise is the way adults live. Ah. Since it can be reduced, just do what you can one step at a time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"For example?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"First of all, you have to protect your own flaws. At least you have to work hard not to show your flaws. Do what you can. Start working hard. Look back at your current self, and try to fix everything that can be improved. As I said earlier, the problem of sexual harassment can only be addressed with grounded steps. &#8230; Do you understand what I'm saying?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, got it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The answer is good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata narrowed her eyes like crescent moons, showing her neat white teeth and smiling, and even a dimple appeared on the edge of her lips. Full smile. This honesty and simplicity are undoubtedly her&nbsp;virtues. Hopefully this kindness will carry over into the future without being strangely twisted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But yes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Contrary to her&nbsp;answer, she&nbsp;didn't understand at all. If you spread your legs in shorts, you can't see where you can't. Her chest, which was pressed against the floor, confirmed her presence as if it would blow up her flimsy T-shirt, and of course her cleavage could be seen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Did this person do it on purpose?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not impossible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even if this is the wick, as a teacher, it has to be shown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Tatsuya pointed it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata looked shocked, and rolled her eyes while keeping her legs open. (To be more precise, Tatsuya held it back when he was about to stand up)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Onii-san, you pervert.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh? This is only half way, are you listening carefully to what other people have to say?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm listening." Hinata replied, keeping her legs outstretched.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be very uncomfortable if I wanted to give up until now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh-, what is this--that--but it is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why. Don't talk to yourself here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a coy smile that was paradoxical to "stupid". Unbearable feelings reach 70%, and happy moods reach 30%. The distribution is like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Those things you say,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span>onii-san</span><span>, otherwise. In other words,&nbsp;</span><span>onii-san</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;">, you treat me as a woman, right......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata said with a "haha" smile while maintaining the posture of spreading her legs and supporting her chin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is an expression to cover 70% shame and 30% happiness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya's heart skipped a beat after being told that&#8212;there was no such thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he&nbsp;was a little younger, he was also a teacher and an adult. I've known her&nbsp;for a long time. You can imagine it would turn out like this. Rather, it was the expected answer,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya snorted while grinning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Attack here. Attack without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on, come on, come on, I have too much self-awareness"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya shrugged his shoulders and made a somewhat arrogant gesture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With exaggerated behavior like a stage actor,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Everyone has it - young and stupid. No matter what it is, thinking in that direction and so on? There are some, I used to be like this. There really will be. Yes, like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm, what-?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Listen Hinata. No matter what pose you take, I won't react at all. Even if you hang next to me in your underwear, it won't work. If you hug me naked, I'll just frown and tell you "Don't act silly "Do you know why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because you're a teacher, right? I've heard it many times,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">. This line"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And your mother also said to me 'please take care of her'."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've heard this phrase many times - my ears will grow big - it's uncomfortable"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata's mood dropped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He pouted, making an obvious ugly face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even so, it's still not ugly, and it's hard to hide one's natural beauty, whether it's praiseworthy or the curse of natural beauty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if your ears are uncomfortable, I still have to say. I am a teacher, and you are a student."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew you when you were in your mother's womb."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I changed your diaper. You're talking, right? Listen to this too&#8212;that's enough."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;In the end, if I really treat you as a woman, it would be absolutely impossible for you to come to my house. Not to mention playing around like this. So, it is impossible for me to treat you as a woman. Above, the proof is complete, is there anything else you want to say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya confirmed calmly and thoroughly, looking at Hinata with sharp eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Decided to be tough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If he doesn't speak directly here, I am afraid she&nbsp;will continue to be complacent. This is a child, this is a second year student ecology. Hard instructions are also a type of softness. Even if he might be hated by her&nbsp;today, she should understand the reason for my attitude after a few years&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No need," Hinata said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sit on the floor with your hands on your knees and bury your face between your knees.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No problem, it's too much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah" Tatsuya came back to his senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her voice trembled and her&nbsp;shoulders shook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata tried hard to say a word.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think so...I didn't mean it...I don't think so, and it's not the same thing..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though she&nbsp;didn't understand what she&nbsp;was talking about, she&nbsp;knew what she&nbsp;wanted to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Blame, rebuke, curse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah!" Tatsuya sighed to the sky. After experiencing countless bitterness, the nirvana of a woman. The ultimate weapon for hominids without a Y chromosome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course Tatsuya knew that. There is no need to be deceived in such a careless manner. In the end, he just made a true claim.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How can you give up on this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But don't give up. Rationality is not a mountain, and sensitivity is king, thanks to this ultimate weapon of nirvana. Rather, it would be a man's defeat to allow her to use this trick.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It really makes people angry&#8212;&#8212;Hinata, who purposely used a &#8220;special move&#8221;, should be treated as a woman&#8212;&#8212;I can only take a step back here, and if it doesn't work, I'll even have to bow my body and head and admit my mistake. . But, as a teacher, I can't give in to this despicable "threat" no matter what, but it seems that there is no other way,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...cheat&#8212;you"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Right time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Tatsuya was still hesitating, he made up his mind, and just as he was about to apologize. Hinata spoke first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not crying&#8212;oh. So you don't have to apologize,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span>onii-san</span><span>."</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was silent for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then in a low voice,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hinata"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You lied to me, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not lying&#8212;you. It's hard to talk&#8212;listen," Hinata sneered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Immediately putting on a smiling face, she&nbsp;rubbed against the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But then again,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;are you a little nervous about me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course I'm nervous. You are my student, or I change your diaper, and I was asked by your mother to look after you. I try my best to educate you every day. But the client was completely unaware of my earnest effort."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata brought her&nbsp;face closer. Evil carnivore smile. Filled with the desire to squeeze prey, the frightening ecology of a 14 year old girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The 24-year-old man who was targeted was still drinking beer quietly. Even if you realize it's bad for you, you won't show it. This is how adults behave.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span>onii-san</span><span>"</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I, it's okay if it's with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What can? "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What I said, but I will always deny it. What else is there to say about that?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hmph&#8212;I see. Uh&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know how many times I've said it, but I'll say it again. That's what they said on the news program just now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Information overload.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya could barely hold his tongue. Stick around and sip on beer to cover up the ugliness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay, onii-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So what are you talking about"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if you really "make a mistake", I won't report it to the Board of Education."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't make a mistake. I've told you several times."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But didn't you just say something,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, you already made up the premise that people can be wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He really said it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya couldn't help but punch himself right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So - I see - ah. It's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata patted him on the back, as if his seniors were cheering on an employee who had just joined the company.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't frown so tightly. I'm on your side,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, so don't worry. Really."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;...Inciting others in this way, I am truly worried about you from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Because you are too nervous with me,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What makes you nervous? You are you, and I am me. Yesterday and the day after, I was eating at home and talking nonsense like this, and it might happen. It will be the same tomorrow and the day after. That's all, nothing's wrong."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Patience is bad for your health.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya sighed. Tonight is also the night to drain my enthusiasm for something boring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But there are still some small results. By procrastinating like this, the timing will always be right.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hinata"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm here"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Already this time. Let's go home today"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was almost time to change the date, and even Hinata had become honest. Tatsuya lazily sent her&nbsp;away as he walked towards the entrance while yawning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata greeted while wearing sandals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"About what I said just now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"About what I said just now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'You lied to me, didn't you?'&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, you said that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What is she&nbsp;talking about?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya searched his memories. Only one clue was found.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Needless to say, so, it was too much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata who was sitting on the floor with her arms crossed, buried her face in her knees and said intermittently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya thought that at this point, today's business was over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he had experienced this many times, it wasn't necessarily the case, but Tatsuya still couldn't shake off this naive idea, and he was careless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said, so what's the matter?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Sadness is real, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then, see you tomorrow! Good night!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata left a smile and closed the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Is it pretending to cry?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not crying&#8212;oh. So you don't have to apologize,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: medium;">onii-san</span><span style="font-size: medium;">."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't treat you as a woman."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Needless to say, so, that's too much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The dialogue in memory keeps repeating itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya scratched his head after thinking about it for about five seconds at the entrance where the student's figure disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's very precocious, son."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In human history, I'm afraid this sentence has been said more than ten billion times from the mouths of adults, and Tatsuya, who should have been a child once, returned to the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If one talks about life in terms of win-lose dualism, then a day called "today" will definitely be recorded as a success or a failure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even the days will go on. If there is today, there will be tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as you live, you will win one day&#8212;&#8212; Tatsuya said to himself. After returning to the living room, he drank an extra bottle of beer. Forget me who keeps losing to middle school students.</span></p>
