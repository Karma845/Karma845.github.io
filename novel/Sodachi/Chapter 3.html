<h3>Chapter 3</b></h3>"Hey brother."</span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Especially?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When does the hair "down" there grow?" (TLN: pubic hair)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In Onodera's apartment, in the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lying on the sofa reading a book, Hinata suddenly turned around to ask.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Enjoying a cup of coffee after dinner, Tatsuya answered weakly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I do not remember."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8212;? Such a boring answer&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Your question is the problem after all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why not? I'm a student and you're a teacher. Shouldn't you answer it for me? Isn't this basic education?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can't just use that excuse and ask for whatever you want.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though I wanted to say that, Tatsuya didn't always think that way. If the one asking wasn't Tsubakiya Hinata, but rather a student who truly had worries in her&nbsp;heart, came to him for advice, he would definitely wholeheartedly face and answer the question for him, that student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, this is Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite her impeccable girl appearance, she was still a child more suited to shorts than skirts, preferring a baseball bat to a magical girl's wand. The only reason why Tatsuya couldn't speak freely was because he knew this girl named Tsubakiya Hinata very well...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Do you really want to know? If you really want to know, I'd be happy to answer."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're not as usual today." Hinata continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Although I asked in a not-so-serious manner, but what if you said that on purpose? Usually when there is a need for advice on a matter you are always tactful?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Turns out, this time it made sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Tatsuya had many worries when she&nbsp;was a junior high school student. When she talked about this with other people, she&nbsp;was also very embarrassed to say it in person. Of course, because this would make people doubt after hearing it, and it would be called trouble.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So just answer the question directly. Don't avoid the question."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not avoiding it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then please answer."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wait, but are you talking about your body? Or do you just want to know exactly [when the hair "down there" grows]? If so, then this is not "teen talk"? Basically, your question has no clear subject, not being able to identify the subject mentioned in the sentence would accidentally make me think that you are asking your own problem, that's why..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really&#8212;!!! Does the national language teacher carry out as many delusions as you, brother?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The anger is gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although still not completely comfortable, but now is the time to show a mature attitude, Tatsuya decided to answer seriously without going around in circles any further.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"OK..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hmm, Hmm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya coughed for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've wanted to say it for a long time, but I don't know why she's embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. I don't remember exactly how either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ummmm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8230; Um&#8230; Well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because Tatsuya was too embarrassed, his words also flew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(No no, I'm talking to a student, just a junior high school student...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though she was told not to be shy, unfortunately Hinata's appearance didn't look like a middle school student at all. It felt as if the two were in the middle of a matchmaking party, reminding him that she&nbsp;had been forced to say such difficult things before after losing the game "Osama dare".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that moment, she&nbsp;was surrounded by the curious gazes of the female students sitting across from him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Hinata's current gaze was no different from those of the girls, as if she was suffering from Deja vu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well..." Tatsuya spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Well&#8230; I honestly can't remember.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, unbelievable. Yet you call yourself mature."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said I don't mind. I just don't remember. It's impossible to answer a question like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, what do you think? It's a waste of time for people who have been waiting to hear it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But if you have something to say, feel free to say it. Feel free to ask. Your age must have a lot of worries about the development of your body, right? Talk to me, I will answer everything for you. This is also the teacher's job."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But how do you get through puberty?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh, that..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Subconsciously, Tatsuya froze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was true that in the fourteen years he&nbsp;had known her, he had never seen Hinata go through puberty. Even though the two were still bathing together until Hinata entered the third grade of elementary school. But due to her rapidly developing appearance by the time she entered junior high school, she assumed that Hinata's internal organs were also well developed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so, that's how it is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey hey? Please don't dodge questions, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh sorry, that doesn't mean anything. I just didn't think I'd answer like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, what do you mean by that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I already said I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So? Do you often have that in your head?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think so!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, after imagining it, are you also 'judging'?" (TLN: judging = manstruating)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You have no imagination and you have no 'judgment'... But, do you usually talk like this with other people, with the boys in your class?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't do it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was so embarrassed that her face turned red. Tatsuya didn't say, the minds of people in puberty were a bit too sensitive than usual, not to mention Hinata's growth rate exceeded that of a junior high school student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But let's put that aside for now. It's your turn onii-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh, what do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've been through this a lot and you still haven't answered, isn't that unfair?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You made all this happen yourself, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Anyway, I can't let you just listen to it okay? Is this a junior high school girl's secret that's hard to reveal? Is it worth the money? After listening, if there's no response, then give me some money."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wow, are you the kid who wants to go into multi-level jobs? Or want to commit robbery and extortion?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Caught listening to it and being asked for money?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you think it's rude&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata frowned, staring intently at him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya quietly took a sip of his coffee. A rare moment of relaxation during the day suddenly became an endless spectacle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you sure you won't tell?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I was just about to say it. But I forgot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Damn, it's scary to say that. People have gathered the courage to tell their secret stories and still don't understand, don't you think you're exaggerating?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you say so, I agree."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tell me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Say what? Your face is too close!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Say!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I told you it was too close, your face far away!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's really close.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Tatsuya is only twenty-four years old, Tatsuya understands very well that every human being will grow old. As we age, the body changes accordingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As you age, your skin will gradually age. Although it was a bit early to tell that Tatsuya was now old, he would occasionally notice the freckles and dark spots that gradually appeared on his face when he shaved every morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Compared to him, the Hinata in front of him looked very young.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Besides, her&nbsp;face looks like an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Suffering for those who have to live together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya made a confused expression. Recently, he sometimes had a hard time restraining Tsubakiya Hinata who was growing so fast.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Who believes that? It can't be like that! Why such nonsense?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata still couldn't stop showing her anger.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HdCwh4Q/14.jpg" alt="14" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">He looked like she&nbsp;was about to cry, no man in this world was strong enough to pretend to be in front of a crying girl. Whether the other person is a child or an adult, even between the two ages mentioned above. Even though the statement was a bit situation-driven, Hinata also said, "How did you get through puberty?".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;For now, I'm telling this story for reference only.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya softened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Only you and I know about this. Promise your honor and then I'll tell you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's a secret only me and onii-san know, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you can say that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Promise your honor!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata's mood suddenly improved. This candor is unconditionally beautiful. it would naturally make people want to do something for her. If it wasn't such a topic, but about love, I would be able to chat with her&nbsp;more generally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them were not related by blood, nor were they family or relatives.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So even though they had been neighbors for a long time, there must be things that Tsubakiya Hinata had not seen until now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Tatsuya was different, he had witnessed and knew everything about her. From the day she started walking alone, when she weaned her milk and diaper, to the day she changed her way of addressing from &#8220;onii-chan&#8221; to &#8220;onii-san&#8221;, to the first time a boy from the same class confessed to her, all day long she gave up her boylike image and started practicing wearing a skirt for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everywhere you look, you can see all the good memories, memories that contributed to creating the little commemorative plaque, which contains evidence of the girl's daily development over time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What happened today was also a memory that he would carry with him&nbsp;for the rest of his life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unfortunately, this memory for him was not very good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Is that so&#8230; Since sixth grade&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata pondered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's the point of being so sad about it? Tatsuya shrugged his shoulders in his lap as he poured a can of beer and drank it. At times like these, it's really annoying not to have alcohol in your body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I see&#8230; Since the sixth grade&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Don't you think it's rude to say it over and over again?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh! But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata put her hand on her cheek, leaning back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But what?"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Screaming in his heart, he emptied the beer can.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's not to be twisted like that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya threw roasted peanuts into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's normal. There's nothing weird or funny here. Totally ridiculous, really."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the sofa in the living room, Hinata sat right next to Tatsuya. The girl kept leaning like this, constantly asking all kinds of questions, looking like a mini nightclub. Though Tatsuya had never been to such a place because of his teacher status.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, when it starts to grow, how does it feel?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh, you still want to talk about this topic?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course. I was just telling you I haven't heard of it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"To be honest, I don't think this is funny."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's up to me to decide whether it's interesting or not, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't need you to evaluate, I said I didn't find it funny. To the point where I wanted to hear what I had to say myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, hey, is that the grass that grows first, or is it the fruit of the rainforest too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who remembers such a thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Have you ever shaved it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What color? Did anything grow yellow or brown?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All black."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so, it turned out to be black hair."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not hair at all!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So when I was just born, onii-san's hair started growing..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata showed deep concern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was as if she&nbsp;was looking into space, reminiscing about the glory days of the Roman empire in the past. It made Tatsuya feel a little complicated, what's with the furry thing down there being exaggerated?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hinata."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I suddenly felt like I was being sexually harassed.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I was just imagining it. This is a student-teacher conversation, isn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? It was just a casual conversation, wasn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. At least I'm happy now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Happy?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya frowned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How much fun is that? Are you happy to see something like this? There is no serious intention to absorb it, and far from the original purpose, what kind of sexual harassment is this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I told you not!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata patted Tatsuya's shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl was very excited. Normally, she&nbsp;was always active, but it was rare to see her&nbsp;this excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Listen to me, I mean happy here means 'satisfied', not 'fun'."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hm&#8230; Hm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Well, isn't 'satisfied' with 'fun' the same as 'pleasure'? What did you say then? You should pay close attention to how words are used, because depending on the mood of the speaker or listener, the meaning of the words will sometimes change. From there, I discovered the hidden meaning of the words we use every day without forgetting their true nature, which is why I love the national language."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. Sure enough, you did listen to what I said."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though you forgot to bring your book on the first day of school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;A thousand apologies! Forget it, try to forget it! I just forgot that I didn't put my books in my bag!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Forget it&#8212; you can't let it go. I should have lectured you on the spot, but ended up letting it go. I already gave you a favor, now you pick it up and throw it in my face?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ahaha, you are a little too much. Are you drunk just drinking that much?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's right, I'm drunk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just because if you don't get drunk, you can't stand it if you don't.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed the way he&nbsp;used it from earlier was a bit heavy, in the end it was also due to him immaturity. Looks like I haven't been able to practice perfectly, Tatsuya thought. But suppose, what if the person she&nbsp;just talked to was another student?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Was it because the opponent was Hinata that she suffered like this from the start?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Was this the heart of a young adult who was only twenty-four years old? Tatsuya didn't know, he really wanted to find out the answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You think too much-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata patted his back again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Don't blame yourself like that. I'm very grateful to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Does the ministry seem grateful enough to solve the problem? But this should be a secret conversation between the two sides, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said don't think too much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Hinata leaned back and lay down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl leaned on Tatsuya's lap.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh&#8212;? I'm showing my gratitude."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is this a sign of gratitude?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If I understood what you were thinking, I wouldn't have reacted like this. That's why I have to make it clear through my actions that I rely on you. Did you feel something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's as if I've never touched you before. It's too heavy, my knee hurts, and it doesn't do me any good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, what do you want? Tell me, I'll do it right away."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No need. I'm a teacher. It's not an honor to bring trouble to yourself and then ask for gratitude to make up for it. As a teacher, you have to save face, especially in front of your students."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onii-san, your knees are really hard&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">gosh</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rub rub.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata used the back of her head to strike at Tatsuya's knee. Due to the proportions, Hinata's head size was pretty neat, but because of her height, Tatsuya couldn't help but feel the heaviness on his knees.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He placed the beer can on Hinata's forehead, causing Hinata to whisper, "So cold~", and moved her legs to and fro. Of course Tatsuya understood what Hinata was thinking. To protect the smile on his lips at a time like this, sacrificing a bit of honor was not worthy of him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, onii-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If I can't take it anymore, I'll pay for it with my body. Let's just say I'll pay you back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite being a young adult, at the same time, Tatsuya is also a teacher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He is not against ancient educational methods, which are now considered obsolete.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya took out a can of beer from the girl's forehead. Instead, he scored a sharp flick of his finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">chip!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound is a bit harsh, but very pleasing to the ear. The snap of a finger brings everything back to the way it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ouch, it hurts! What are you doing now!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you know? I punish you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't just flick people's foreheads, you're too much! You idiot"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He ignored Hinata, while at the same time ignoring his own superficiality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The alcohol in beer made his intestines twist. Both he and Hinata were still too far from the goal of "maturity". Struggling, the two of them, step by step, the two of them moved forward together.</span></p>
