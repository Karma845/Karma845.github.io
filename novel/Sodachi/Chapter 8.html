<h3><b>Chapter 8</b></span></h3><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One day at the end of May.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was taken to the infirmary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, Onodera-sensei, I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The student who greeted Tatsuya, who rushed to the infirmary in a hurry after receiving the news, was sitting on the bed as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is a mess. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He also felt relieved. But at the same time, he was getting tired of the bad predictions coming true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was wearing a sports uniform with large gauze on her cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wounded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And it's still on the face of a young girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not a serious injury."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rinko Matsumoto, a nurse teacher, explained before Tatsuya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Because it's a wound that will go away in a few days, so don't worry. There will be no scars. But don't forget that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's too much trouble."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wasn't every day like this when I was little?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about the hospital? Better go to the hospital for now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So it's too much trouble. It's healed, so no. It's just a bruise."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I really don't want that. My mom should be sleeping now that she's worked so hard. If you make things too big, the atmosphere in class will be worse."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is not the time to force yourself to prioritize actions that generally make sense. Students must be considered first. It's also limited to this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Can you tell me what happened? But you don't have to force yourself to say it now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Um&#8212;that. I had a fight with someone else.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know it. What is the reason?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What was the reason for the fight?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's no big deal. It's just bullshit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just want to know the details of the fight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh-hmm. I'm a little dizzy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata lay firmly on the bed as if on purpose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed she didn't want to talk about it. There must be a subtle reason for the fight in class, Tatsuya concluded. It was probably something the teacher didn't want to touch. Students must now be given priority.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know. After all, are you resting in the infirmary like this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm&#8212;. Actually, it's fine to go back to class. It's gym class. High jump. I really like it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How can I let an injured person exercise. You can rest until the next class. I'll be with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, sensei?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;In that case, you can also go home early too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's free! It will be shown by my mother."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then rest. I'll be here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really-!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata put on a sullen face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that's just "putting on a bad face". From Tatsuya's years of experience, this was Hinata's appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The nurse teacher left the table very tactfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were only two people left in the infirmary. The sound of students screaming in the distance. Looks like someone had a good high jump record in high school jumping rush in gym class, causing quite a bit of commotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Want some tea?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8212;? What kind of tea?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ordinary green tea. There's a kettle and a water heater here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I want some juice&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be too particular about it. Is the green tea okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata pulled back the blanket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first glance, Hinata seemed to be in a better mood. It's almost the same as when the two of you spend time together in the living room of an apartment. At least it seems so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I will be taken care of by the teacher today&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll take care of you, isn't your face just scratched? Do you need to do anything else?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How about wiping my sweat with a wet towel?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't have a fever."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And then&#8212;&#8212;, took my hand and pushed me then said "It's okay, Tsubakiya, it's just a minor injury!" or something"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay Tsubakiya. It's just a minor injury."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Make the tea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them took a sip of hot drinks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Time passed quietly. Now was not the time for her to say too much. The dispute occurred not long ago. It was necessary to calm her down for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is so bitter," Hinata muttered, taking a sip of the green tea she wasn't used to drinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's bitter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya nodded and took a sip of his tea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Morning before the rainy season. The two of them looked up at the slightly overcast sky through the window and listened to the voices of the students screaming from the field.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ayaka is right"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki confirmed this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the first floor of the teaching building, there is a student guidance room next to the office.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fujimoto Asuka was ready to listen to the situation for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if you say she's right,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka used a reproachful tone,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But the person who did it was your friend Toyota Ayaka, right? There's no reason for anything to go wrong. This is completely absurd."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gently Segawa Natsuki, who was sitting on the sofa, fell silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stubborn middle school girl. It was an attitude that didn't match her age-appropriate makeup and mature-looking appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What does Teshima-san think of that?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have to admit that things get a little tricky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka asked another student present, Teshima Miyuu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;When Tsubakiya Hinata was injured, there were Toyota Ayaka, Segawa Natsuki, and Teshima Miyuu, right? If Toyota-san is right, is it Tsubakiya-san's fault? What is Tsubakiya-san doing? Is there something Ayaka-san should do? ?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not that"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Teshima Miyuu shrunk into a ball. Shrugging her shoulders tightly, her hands caught between her knees reminded me of some kind of small animal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It has nothing to do with Teshima-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's Tsubakiya's usual way of laughing at the way she talks. She's actually laughing. That's why Ayaka did it. Otherwise, I'll do it too. Suspension or dismissal or whatever, just face it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It doesn't seem calm yet. From Segawa Natsuki's behavior, I temporarily knew the reason why Ayaka couldn't control her emotions, which was called lip-for-mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even if she said it didn't matter whether she was suspended or coaxed, she wasn't the party to the violence. The person involved was a Toyota Ayaka who wasn't here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let Ayaka go home first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the quarrel and the person, the one who was hit was confused, while the one who was hit seemed to be fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...Ah, that's not the case. In general, Toyota Ayaka was hit hard and went a little crazy. From the point of view of protecting students, the current state of affairs was not suitable for positive conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Things can happen too. The luxuriously dressed Toyota Ayaka is also a serious child growing up. Such a thing could happen, Asuka believed this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It must be troublesome to let Asuka go to the student tutoring room. What's more, there are extremely evil people in the group.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In everyone's eyes, several students with different styles turned out to be the starting point of disagreement. Or should I be happy for her luck that she got here today without incident?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, in the end,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka returned to the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you arguing? It's annoying to ask so many times."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've said it many times. It was Tsubakiya's fault for 'laughing at the usual way of speaking'. I don't know what I said, and I can't judge whether it's good or bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed that no matter what, she would not speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps, if you didn't make a big compromise now, Ayaka wouldn't be telling the truth. Asuka, who had just served as an assistant student advisor, knew that the world's eyes were very tight these days. There is even the possibility of being held accountable forcibly. She&nbsp;wanted to avoid a situation that was like a slap in the face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(As expected, it's Tsubakiya-san...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Segawa Natsuki said that name, Asuka felt a kind of strange feeling from her. Could this be an illusion? Even though Toyota Ayaka insisted that "that was Tsubakiya's usual way of speaking in ridicule", if nothing special happened, she wouldn't lose her mind in gym class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person who moves first loses is a typical example of this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata, who was sent to the infirmary due to several violent attacks, didn't even move a finger from the other party.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Teshima Miyuu who was cowering watching Fujimoto Asuka and Segawa Natsuki spoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Things are getting serious.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">True honest thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka and Hinata didn't have a bad relationship. On the other hand, it is a good relationship. At least starting today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Never expected this to happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although this is a very rude feeling, but if it is Natsuki, you will understand. After all, using outdated language to describe her, she was the type to be reckless and act before thinking. Although after an actual conversation, you will find that she is actually a very considerate person. Although a little impatient. Less than ten days after the first contact with cooking practice, Miyuu's forehead had been slapped many times. Although I know it's a joke, but it's not surprising to say that Natsuki will cause violence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the one who did it was Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the cool type. Maybe smart too. Although I haven't seen her listen to the class well, it seems that her test scores are not bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki is in charge of stepping on the gas pedal, while Ayaka is in charge of stepping on the brakes. Two people who had known each other long before Miyuu played their respective roles through division of labor and cooperation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The division of roles is broken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not only that, but Ayaka had already started. It doesn't match her image.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, even though Natsuki said "Otherwise I'll do it", but she was the one who stopped the fight. The sluggish Miyuu couldn't do anything about it. What you can do is imprint it on your own eyes from start to finish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Teshima-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fujimoto Asuka gave Teshima a glass of water.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You're the only one with them, right? Can you tell the teacher what happened?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki, who had calmed down and remained silent, almost became impatient. Even though the student advisor's face was smiling, it was the kind of smile that wasn't smiling. It's more troublesome just because she looks pretty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You were with them, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes. With them"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What happened?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That, that&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to find a hole to enter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Firstly, Miyuu, who was naturally not good at speech, did not have the confidence to reveal the scene in detail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Second, Natsuki on the side made a "If you dare say it, I'll kill you" expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This bothers me a lot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka scratched her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If this happens, it will affect the application for next year. I really want to finish it as successfully as possible... But I don't know how Tsubakiya-san's parents will react..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu's shoulders shook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka's words inadvertently revealed her true thoughts. It worked. This is more heartbreaking than a direct threat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The debate continued for some time after that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What happened?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know, I don't want to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Constant repetition of such conversations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka was unyielding, and Natsuki was even more stubborn. Miyuu was surprised. She thought Segawa Natsuki would be more reckless and shrewd, but it seemed she was also the type of person who would live up to her beliefs. In terms of some communication, although it can't be said that the relationship with Segawa Natsuki is very close, but Miyuu still has a good impression of her. Perhaps this belief stemmed from a sense of justice befitting Segawa Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"-So."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka finally gave up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think there is no point in wasting time like this. Asuka waved at Segawa Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Segawa-san, you can go back to class now. I'll ask you about the specific situation. I might ask your parents to come next time, can you accept it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki stood still, and left the student tutoring room with a heavy stomp on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When she closed the door, her eyes pierced like nails. "Teshima, don't talk too much&#8212;" Even though she didn't make a sound, she could understand it. This is a very strong threat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah&#8212;it bothers me&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka smiled kindly when there were only two people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was also restrained. Although she knew this was a mature approach, she was already under a lot of pressure now. Too effective for her of the small animal breed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did Teshima-san also decide not to say anything?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh, that&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What would you do?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not proud, Miyuu is weak. If she was threatened by an adult, she would probably say everything without hesitation. Therefore, although I admire Natsuki's actions, I don't think Miyuu can do the same. On the other hand, there is no belief that confidentiality should be maintained. Furthermore, Miyuu was in a "can't do anything" position, and had no positive relationship with this incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8230;Not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was not a positive relationship, but there was a relationship - rather, it was she who created the moment for the event to happen. Miyuu was well aware of this. That's why it takes courage to testify.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can Fujimoto-sensei imagine what happened?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm? Hmm&#8212;maybe"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka leaned back on the sofa and took a sip of tea from the cup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Woman. Dress well in a women's suit. Beautiful young women are also very popular among college students. Of course it is also very popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;From that point of view, I am very curious about the students. I can't know everything, but if I don't master it to a certain level, I won't be able to work.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, say it. Can I imagine it, maybe? I can guess the reason why Segawa-san won't say it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu agreed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's called warmth. From a student advisor's point of view, I really don't want to make things too big. Maybe the teacher is thinking about the students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"-At that time"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;When Tsubakiya-san said bad things to Toyota-san. At that time, Tsubakiya-san and I, Toyota-san and Segawa-san were gathering. The four of us are probably the only ones who know what happened."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. So if the four of you don't say anything, maybe no one will know the truth of this matter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Though Tsubakiya-san or Toyota-san might as well say it. But I always feel that those two are 'I don't know how to put it'. And it's not a topic they can be forced to talk about."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. I understand. Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, is this enough?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This seems to be an understanding teacher. If it was an older teacher, it definitely wouldn't stop there. Was it because she was a young teacher? Or because she was expected to do such an act that she was hired as a student advisor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course...but"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If it is satisfactorily resolved, there will be no accountability. Now everything has been satisfactorily resolved. Isn't it just meddling all the time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes. That"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Toyota-san also quit early because of that hit, so she's thought about it. This injury would not leave a mark &#8212; no, even if it was an injury that would leave a mark, as long as the matter between the parties was resolved, there would be no problem on the teacher's side. Of course, if there is dissatisfaction between the two sides, the teacher will use the teacher's authority to let them speak. ... How? It's a good compromise, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes it is. But even so, I'm not in a position where I can say anything..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Also, although I haven't told Toyota-san yet, it's fine if you don't apologize."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, is that okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It does not matter. Besides, if it turned into an apology or a lawsuit from the parents, we wouldn't be here. If you take the appropriate approach to it, it will be difficult to end. Otherwise, adults will do unnecessary things. Otherwise you don't think it will be a topic like "where is the student autonomy?" What's that? In my opinion, students are better off dealing with students themselves. After all, it's impossible for everyone to get along. Even if the relationship is irreparable, it is possible to deal with each other wisely, I think this is called social learning"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes. Yes, I think so too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fujimoto Asuka who is a second grade English teacher A, is a straightforward person. Miyuu was slightly surprised when she spoke in a tone that sounded like she was chatting with her classmates at school. Could it be that the English teacher also had thoughts on this incident? Or maybe it's because she's a little slower than usual when there's only two people around&#8212;or maybe because she's mature enough to let other people think that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So? Is there anything you want to tell me? As long as Teshima-san doesn't do anything like inciting this incident, you can be released now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, inciting something! I can only stand still in fear, and there is absolutely no incitement..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"True. But if I don't know what's going on here, I can only guess at random."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"As far as I know. I really have to ask something about the situation, and that's why I'm in a difficult position. Although it's fine not to say it now, but I'm still very interested. You see, Tsubakiya-san is something more conspicuous than ordinary people, right?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So how? Of course, if you don't want to say it, I won't ask, and I will try my best to respect the privacy of the students."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She felt that she should remain silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But at the same time, she also felt that she should not remain silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, it was a bad thing to hide what I saw at that moment only in the depths of my heart. Presumably, what she said was of no benefit to anyone, and it was a painful act for Miyuu herself. Even though she was warned by Natsuki's gaze, perhaps now was the time to wake up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What shall I say now"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;um, okay, I know, shut up about what I heard from you? Seriously....Ah, but only the four of you know about the situation, right? That way, it's easy to know that Teshima-san told me, right? ? Hmm&#8212;that's also very annoying, hmm&#8212;what should I do?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, no, it's not like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Please tell others that I said it. I still want to be in charge of this level of responsibility. Besides, regarding this incident, I was the one who created the trigger."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka blinked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe surprised. Miyuu herself was also surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But it was actually Asuka who tried to correct her attitude to hear what Miyuu had to say next.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though this was not a topic of life, for a sophomore junior high school girl, in a sense, such a topic was heavier than life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I have no friends, and this becomes an opportunity to stir up discord. And it always feels a little inappropriate to say something like that.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this point, Miyuu was searching for words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if there is a search, there is no other way but to reveal the facts as they are.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just say the words that come to your mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This incident, I think it's Tsubakiya-san's fault"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;A fight between second-year girls?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, did you see it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see it, I see it. Even though it's a bit far away"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Meanwhile, on the other hand, the gym class continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the north side of the playground, the second year girls were practicing the high jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the third grade boys on the south side were practicing their sprint.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Takayama, did you see it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"-Ah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takayama Kaito asked his classmates, wiping the sweat off his cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Second grade girls' physical education class. Isn't there a fight? There seems to be a fight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition, Kaito's eyes changed drastically.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What happened?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&#8220;Looks like someone got into a fight. Some sophomore girls. Someone was beaten and sent to the infirmary.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito looked at the second year girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">High jump lessons are still in progress. But no girl figure stands out more than anyone. Although she tried her best not to pay special attention, she was there when gym class had just started. And from a distance, the second year girls looked a little strange. It was true that if there was a fight between classmates, it was not in the mood for class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looks like Tsubakiya Hinata was beaten,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Another classmate testified.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Someone saw her by accident. Well, after all, she is an eye-catching girl, and every eye is always on her, subconsciously. Even though I don't see her."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey. What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? What? That's why I said I didn't see it. Even though I know that Tsubakiya's breasts are quite big, I'm not a big-breasted type."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't ask you that. I asked you why Tsubakiya-san was beaten. Who hit her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You&#8230; Even if you ask me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito's steady and aggressive pressure made his classmates wince.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Looks like Toyota Ayaka is hitting.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Another classmate came out to give permission.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know why, but it seems quite difficult. Not once, but many times. Even though I don't see it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito was silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The friends next to me are still talking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who's Toyota Ayaka?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Second year A-class student. Kinda cute&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, the one that stood out the most was when she was in first grade. It really looks like a style that can take decisive action.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;No, no, you might say It's Segawa Natsuki. Toyota Ayaka is Segawa Natsuki's companion, who is quiet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why is that guy fighting with Tsubakiya?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Perhaps there was a dispute?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are they arguing about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I don't know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What are you arguing about?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito thought that in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, he had no intention of saying it here. Instead, he regretted his rather unwise words and actions. Even if regret is useless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, the dispute seems to have been settled?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Should we say it's settled. One side goes to the infirmary, and the other side is probably in the student guidance room."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Student tutoring room? Will Asuka-chan show up?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh, she and Asuka-chan are alone. Those two are very lucky."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"They're lucky, of course. But if it's all girls, it's unlucky."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe not Asuka-chan, but the Head of Student Guidance."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Head of Student Guidance? Isn't that Hell?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you are summoned, you will be eaten. Hell for boys and girls."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who's the homeroom teacher of Class A, Year 2?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onodera Tatsuya, who teaches the National language."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, you know? Rumors of Tatsuya-sensei and Asuka-chan"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Topic changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The contents of the topic also reached the ears of Kaito, who was worried about Tsubakiya Hinata's situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Someone saw them on a date"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, what's up. I've never heard of it"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What was the date like. A hotel? Could it be a love hotel?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, I don't know. I also heard it from other people. But it's not impossible even in a hotel, right? They're all grown up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not enough just a garden. Usually she goes to the hotel."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, that's too hard for me. I like Asuka-chan."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where did you hear it. I've never heard of it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I don't know either. But it seems like a lot of people know? Among the students in our school. It would be better to say that there are only a few people who don't know?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Does Kaito know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I do not know"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">National language teacher and English teacher are together, so what happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It has nothing to do with Kaito. All he cared about was how Tsubakiya Hinata was doing now. If you don't go to class, we'll be gossiping here, but I hope to at least continue the conversation there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nervous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Friends who did not pay attention to this continued to talk about the teacher's love story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it really was a shock&#8212;. If it's true, I can't stand it&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After all, these two are single young people. Sure enough, there is such a thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is love at work&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Have you done it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Already done it. It's all adults. It's not about whether Tsubakiya Hinata did it or not. It must be enough to hug her-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey! Over there. !"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Beep beep-!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The whistle sounded like thunder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The physical education teacher Tamura-sensei rebuked loudly with a red face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Are you guys taking good care of your time!? If you're lazy, let me continue after class!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oops"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, who's lazy first. I got scolded too"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The third grade boys, quite intrigued by the gossip, returned to their gym class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, Kaito, the only one who ran out of extraordinary results, stood at the starting line again to set a new record.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">All he realized was that he might be the cause of the dispute. A few days ago, he was called by Toyota Ayaka and confessed to him, and he refused because he already had someone else he liked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito doesn't realize that the love story between teachers is good - a topic he ignores, and that is also the reason for the dispute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just a few rumours.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to Teshima Miyuu's memory, it was the first trigger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, did you know? Rumors of Ono Tatsuya and Asuka-chan."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before gym class, while changing clothes in class. For some reason, Segawa Natsuki brought up this topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are the rumors about Ono Tatsuya and Asuka-chan?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka who naturally followed the topic. At this moment, the atmosphere was still as ordinary as ever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The two of them seem to have become&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, is that right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really. That's what Hoshimura-senpai from the third year said."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How far have they become?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looks like someone saw them walk out of the love hotel together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Lies. Are you serious?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course this is serious. 100% true news"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is the basis of 100%?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;So Hoshimura-senpai is a third year&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Okay&#8212;but&#8212;hesitating. I feel like this rumor is too much&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From Miyuu's point of view, Ayaka made the news more reliable through deliberate questioning. Even though it had only been ten days since she had started chatting with them, Miyuu somewhat understood Natsuki and Ayaka's combination.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Especially Ayaka's side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is not as cold as she seems at first glance. At least she wasn't born with that kind of character, but it gives the impression that she created that image on purpose. This was indeed the case, and it must have been very different from Natsuki responding with a conditioned reflex. From Miyuu's point of view, it felt like she was "trying to look older".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...even if it's just a feeling)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is a common misconception among members of the literature and arts club who love detective dramas. Miyuu couldn't deny what she said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Anyway, the current Ayaka still looked the same as usual. Even if the topic of rumors was suddenly thrown around, it would still be the usual Ayaka and the usual Natsuki. The girls were the only ones present as they changed into their gym uniforms. When everyone took off their clothes, they became less stiff. Even though the topic wasn't very explicit, it was natural to bring up similar gossip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Also, Miyuu knew about the rumors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the Literature and Arts Club the day before, I had no idea who brought up this topic, and it had been hotly discussed for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So even if this topic was brought up by Miyuu, nothing would be unimaginable about it. Maybe it was for some reason or the timing wasn't right that she didn't pick it up, or maybe it was because Miyuu didn't talk much. In short, it was Segawa Natsuki who brought up the topic this time, and it was Toyota Ayaka who was in charge of questioning the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya-san - what do you know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So even though the Toyota Ayaka is a hot topic, it's a very natural trend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a well-known fact that Tsubakiya Hinata lives very close to Onodera-sensei.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh...? I don't know..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata who took off her uniform answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of the four, she was the one closest to the window. At that moment, only her back and long black hair were visible. In Miyuu's memory, her voice was the same as usual, but she didn't seem to see her expression clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's better to say that I know nothing. Even if I live nearby, it has nothing to do with it. Oh, but is it true? Onodera-sensei and Asuka-chan? Are they dating?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"According to Natsuki, it should be&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If what Hoshimura-senpai said is true. But uh-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki added while tying her hair in a headband.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if I get out of the love hotel, I don't know where the love hotel is. Maybe it's just a reinforcement of rumors like where we ate together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait Natsuki. Didn't you say everything was 100% true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I didn't see it with my own eyes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, I'm just talking about it now&#8212;? Don't bring that up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't that a common thing? Both of them are adults. Elementary school teachers will also get married in regular workplaces."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata stood by the window, her back to this side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Slender height. Hands combing black hair into a high ponytail. Neck that looks clean.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter what she did back then, she looked like an adult. Of course, as long as Hinata followed the growth of her body, she was a complete adult&#8212;in Teshima Miyuu's eyes, her current speech was like speaking with the same gaze as Onodera-sensei and Asuka-sensei.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's better to talk about being a virgin at that age,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata continued further.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"On the contrary, it would be even more disgusting. If you don't even have a boyfriend or something, I feel a little uncomfortable. She&nbsp;still looks amazing at normal times."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. Virginity is quite disgusting&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But does Ono Tatsuya look that amazing?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki agreed, while Ayaka asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I thought it was a very simple type. Her&nbsp;way of speaking was soft and elegant, and not too gloomy. More handsome."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh-? Are you serious?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki scoffed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ayaka, don't you think Tatsuya-sensei is quite good?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? What are you talking about?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After all, I've always felt that Ayaka likes Ono Tatsuya."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think so. I'm really going to die. I hit you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do not be like--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka poked Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ugya Uhya</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki bowed with a strange cry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;What happened at that time was roughly the same as above.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was nothing at that time. At the time, I didn't even think about it, that violence broke out just minutes later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, if the unexpected didn't happen, Miyuu would probably forget about this conversation while changing clothes. This level of "little squabbling" or "looking at each other's faces" is normal among girls. Even Miyuu, who had the lowest female strength, didn't find it strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next opportunity came after Hinata's outstanding performance in the high jump class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was praised by her classmates in turn, and Miyuu praised her as usual without hesitation. I'm afraid this chain of events is the trigger for the event.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did Tsubakiya-san not join the athletics club?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu felt that this was a very simple question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Miyuu's words, Hinata panicked for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm&#8212;the athletics club? I'm pretty good with the homecoming club&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's too wasteful, Tsubakiya-san. Your jump is really high. If you join the athletics club and train hard, you'll be able to become an official Athlete very soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh-um, is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You have jumped 1.4 meters? Isn't it amazing? Not many girls can jump that high at once? That might as well be considered a record among boys.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah - Yah -. I am the same as a boy. Ah Haha."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, really superhuman."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was Segawa Natsuki who intervened between the two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Why did you jump so easily? I only jumped 1.2 meters. And it's still jumping backwards? Can such a thing be done all at once? Curving backwards like that is hard to do. Right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;By the way, I can't even jump 80 centimeters.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata reluctantly "aha" and scratched her head with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it's still a waste."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu said that the more excited she was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;If you join the athletic club, you will definitely become very strong. I guess it's not too late to join now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu had to admit that she was a little excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, the sun was too beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The figure jumping gracefully to a height comparable to Miyuu's was as impressive as it looked from the outside, and it didn't live up to anyone else's expectations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course Miyuu was just a commoner, but she still felt beautiful. It might not be like that for someone in the professional athletics department.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah. By the way, in the athletics club, there is Takayama-senpai who practices the high jump, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">continued the excited Miyuu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm happy because I'm very happy, but is that a happy thing in itself? Now that I think about it, it seems this sentence was the real incentive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That guy's grades seem to be able to compete in the competition between high schools. If we train together, Tsubakiya-san will definitely be able to jump from a better grade&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think her posture is far from good,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka added.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They had been silent until here, but suddenly opened their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Tsubakiya-san is still not good enough. But even so, she jumped 1.4 meters, it was amazing. But in other words, there is no aesthetic feeling. If there really is beauty, the dance will be even more beautiful.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead, Miyuu shrank suddenly. With her animal-like appearance and personality, she is sensitive to the feelings of others. Ayaka showed no hostility to her, but from the subtle difference in her words, she could sense a clear aggressiveness. Just imagine a stormy night. The scene where the sound of thunder sounded out of nowhere and drove the small animals to hide in the nest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That is--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata replied casually. So far so good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's great, Tsubakiya-san. Come join the athletics club and see.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka didn't give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;And it's good to train with Takayama-senpai. That way you can understand your level. After all, Takayama-senpai was someone who could stand on a higher ground. After all, in our school, even the teachers who are assigned to teach supervisors. Not. If I go to another school, I might even be able to participate in the competition between high schools."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The atmosphere was clearly going bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It might be fine if the topic changed here, but there was nothing Miyuu could do. She could only stare at her&nbsp;two friends who had just made new friends in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki might be able to do it. But at this moment, she was quietly watching. From Miyuu's point of view, I'm afraid that Natsuki is also confused. As a result, if you get confused here, you will fail, but that's not something to blame.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Toyota-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even at this time, she still looked as if nothing had happened. At least it seems so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is there anyone you like?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She stared at Hinata silently. At this moment, the enmity had undoubtedly been exposed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can't you and Ono Tatsuya tease each other?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka blurted out those words harshly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This time is very important for Takayama-senpai, don't influence him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ahh"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata wanted to express her understanding, but only let out a slightly dull sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hah, hah. Miyuu's lips froze. If this situation continued like this, Hinata's attitude would clearly accept Ayaka's provocation. No, it should have provoked Ayaka. Even the places that had not been burned were gradually starting to smoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I remember."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata said with such an attitude, as if she had been asked to buy something but forgot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Takayama-senpai, the one who confessed to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A cold voice rang out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was the sound of Ayaka's slap hitting Hinata's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a crisp, sharp sound that was enough to be noticed by everyone on the playground.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sick."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Completely painless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though she wiped her reddened cheeks in the blink of an eye, it seemed like she was being licked by a dog. Tsubakiya Hinata, who was over 1.7 meters tall, stared at the person who bumped into her with a mosquito-bite attitude. Although not serious, the scene was reminiscent of a professional wrestling exhibition match. "Come on hit me and try" such a provocation. Actually hit. Even so, she kept on making provocations like "Let's try hitting me". Even if she was hit harder, she would not fall or give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pinched. The cold voice sounded again. This time the slap hit the other side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A dull sound rang out at the same time. This was the sound of an angry Ayaka kicking Hinata with her leg.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Evolving to this step, Natsuki had to stop her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait, don't hit her idiot!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki intervened between the two. Ayaka whose face turned red didn't know what she was shouting, but she broke away from Natsuki and rushed in front of Hinata again. Hinata rubbed her kicked thigh in a "painful" manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The physical education teacher ran over with a big change on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The other students who noticed it then also gathered around curiously about what was going on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata's face was covered in sticky blood. It's like the whole face was gouged out by nails&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't remember much about what happened after that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When she regained consciousness, Miyuu was already in the student guidance room, explaining the situation to the student advisor Asuka Fujimoto. However, the panicked Miyuu might not be able to fully explain the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Oh, I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka nodded after hearing everything. If something was complicated, it was probably because she didn't expect her name to appear in the testimony.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for telling me. I know the general situation. But&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka looked troubled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"According to what you told me, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Tsubakiya-san. As expected, Toyota-san was the one who made the first move, and Tsubakiya-san didn't do anything at all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu shook her head vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubiya-san wasn't beaten, she was looking for a hit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looking for a hit?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yes, she was deliberately provocative. Let's just say that Toyota-san who bumped into someone was even more injured. Even though Tsubakiya-san was indeed injured, she probably wasn't. Sick. I guess I'm used to the situation. Even if I get beaten up by Toyota-san, it looks like I'm still fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Two, three times, Asuka blinked in succession.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there really such a thing? Self-inflicted damage of eight hundred thousand to the enemy, or something like that?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how mature, would a girl in middle school be like this?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"At that time, Tsubakiya-san seemed to be angry about something. Should I say that I was upset or in a bad mood... Now that I think about it, I seem to have felt that way when I changed clothes at the gym."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu, who said this in one breath, let out a "yes".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, her expression suddenly became troubled,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What will I do next?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you worried?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka took a sip of her tea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu looked at Asuka with her animal-like attitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course I'm worried."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka smiled helplessly,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm a little worried too. Whether it's Toyota-san, Tsubakiya-san, or the others. Things that needed to be done piled up. I felt like I was going to run around after that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">" ...Will I be suspended?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There is no suspension in junior high school. But there will be some sanctions&#8230; I will try my best to resolve this matter satisfactorily and not get to that point. Well, it's not the most important thing if both parties apologize to each other. . Okay? And if we can reconcile like before, hurray&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think it's possible to reconcile," said Miyuu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unexpectedly, Miyuu herself, whose tone became harsh, did not expect it either. Asuka's eyes widened in surprise at the fact that this was proven.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu hastily added,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, this. If there was a real dispute between girls, they probably wouldn't be able to reconcile. It might not happen between boys, but it couldn't be between girls. If it could be reconciled. If it was, it might not be a dispute. real. That's what I thought."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is it written like this in the book?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Neither confirms nor denies, adult attitudes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Anyway, I understand the situation. Thank you for telling me so much. There may be more I want to say, but that's the teacher's job. Let's go back to class... Ah, by the way. Please. Keep things a secret. what I'm saying here. Originally, these things weren't to be said to the students."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;After Miyuu Teshima left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka sat on the sofa with a "yes".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's&#8212;that's&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the problem becomes more complex, it makes sense to listen to the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Superficial disputes will definitely be resolved. But what about the problems that arise? This part may be difficult to handle easily. Since ancient times, people in the world generally believe that the more disputes involving love and love, the easier it is to cause bloodshed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tatsuya-kun is also very strict."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The tea turned bad after being heated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bitter taste of cheap tea leaves overwhelms the tongue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course I'm having a hard time. But this incident, is it my fault? No, no, no, no. Uh-hmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Realizing this from her point of view, Asuka was caught in the trouble of worrying about things unnecessarily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the same time in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">infirmary</span><span style="font-size: large;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, Onodera-sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's the matter, Tsubakiya-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you using your tongue to tie a knot on a cherry stalk?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is Hinata as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya and she were the only ones in the infirmary. The nurse teacher Matsumoto Rinko returned briefly, but then she disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No" replied Tatsuya quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The answer to this question is not embarrassing. Tatsuya wasn't shy either. There is no place for shame. She&nbsp;could answer with dignity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It can't be done. It can't be done. After all, the human tongue wasn't made for that sort of thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No resistance. Boys should try that kind of thing in their lives. A teacher can't be friends with someone who hasn't tried anything like that. Absolutely not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aren't you narrow-minded?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not narrow. For example, if the dean of the school or the principal told me that they never tried to tie a knot with their tongue. Sorry, I see them like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What expression?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Such a phrase. Do you understand? I've said it many times, as an educator? Someone who is in a position of teaching young students? Never try to tie a knot with your tongue, It's like giving a math class to a student who doesn't even know the multiplication table. Can such a person qualify as a teacher? It's not that they can't qualify."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said so"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But that's absolutely impossible. Now that you're an educator, you've never tried anything like that in your life."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is it really that good? You are so arrogant."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;To be honest, I was also scared when I said it. But ah, tying cherry stalks with my tongue gave me so many bitter memories. I thought if no one else experienced it except me. Such bitter memories are like denying my life to me&#8230;. But it just says that there are exceptions to everything. The dean of student affairs and the principal are too far away from me to deny the possibility that there was no such culture at all when they were born.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And it's very difficult to tie a cherry stem with the tongue. As I said earlier, the human tongue is not for that. There is still a long way to go.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, I mentioned about that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You really know that!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was lying on the bed, and Tatsuya was sitting on a folding chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Actually, there is no need to lie in bed. Hinata's face was injured instead of being physically unwell. What's more, Hinata had returned to her former state, and now it was just a kind of flirtation, a kind of playfulness. Tatsuya now seemed to coax a tormented child who didn't want to sleep&#8212;that is, indeed, it had been Onodera Tatsuya and Tsubakiya Hinata all along.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tie the cherry stalk with your tongue."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's fine if you don't. What else can't you do? There are no cherries in the infirmary.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I can show it to you. The mouth and tongue move like this. Hey, look at you? My tongue moves really well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't sexually harass at school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, it wasn't sexual harassment at all, was it? We were just talking about moving our tongues by the way, right? How would that be sexual harassment? Hinata didn't&#8212;get it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Truly an asshole.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya also cursed loudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This guy really got carried away. Since there were only two people with their noses in their faces, and because they were in a situation where they were "wounded by a fight and treated", what they said was irrelevant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Talking about the same things at the infirmary as when the two of them were at home."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If that's the case, this guy must be enjoying it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a little bit interesting and overwhelming. Hinata probably put the bickering aside for now, and was full of excitement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just like the goal. Tatsuya's goal here was to take care of Hinata. It was also his wish to see her as usual. But this had also been the case all along - the one walking in the opposite direction to Hinata, in other words the victim, was not anyone else but Tatsuya himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Sometimes I want someone else to do it for me. In this situation."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh&#8212;? What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I didn't say anything. However, that show should be avoided.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So boring... ah, could it be a teacher" "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is going on?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Still awkward? Because her skills aren't as good as that of a middle school girl."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Onodera Tatsuya has also grown up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So I can't think of anything that would upset me. Being bullied by students has long been commonplace, and if something of this magnitude isn't easy to deal with, it's impossible to become a teacher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So he had used an old-fashioned attitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Why are you turning your back on me right now?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's because you're full of energy right now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm fresh, why are you turning your back on me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's because, if you're already very energetic, it's fine if I don't continue to accompany you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aren't you just running away?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That was so bad. I didn't run away anywhere. I'm still here as proof."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even with my back, I can imagine she looking behind my head. After all, we've known each other for so long. There was an unpleasant laugh like a cat playing with its prey from behind, only the little girl who seemed to be climbing the adult ladder for the first time must be full of joy now. Hinata, who was lying on the bed, was covered with a blanket, and only her face was visible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do as she pleases. Say whatever you want.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Leave her alone for now. This is just a little sister who is slightly older in age, so please endure the restlessness in your heart. This is the attitude that adults should have, the composure of parents. Even if it was said that he looked back and was said to have run away, could he do with a sullen face and ignore it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Silence enveloped the infirmary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya's strategy was to focus exclusively on defense. Make Hinata's care a top priority, and avoid toughness with didactic methods. Instead of attacking. No matter how you get surrounded, you just need to apply the word "patience". It doesn't matter what you say, it doesn't matter how you are blamed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Onodera Tatsuya accepted this dilemma with pride.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is the responsibility of those who choose to take the path of the teacher and have an unexpected relationship with this special girl, Tsubakiya Hinata, in other words, destiny.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Temporary silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A voice came from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Nothing&#8212;nothing&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ehehe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Holding a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Here it was decided to "hold on".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmm (three votes)~. It's nothing&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Haha</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's always fine. If I'm bothered by something like this, I'll eliminate it below.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, sensei"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That&#8212;I just wanted to call you&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ehehe</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed it is. A plan that had been crumpled in my head until I looked back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Tatsuya was very mature, "broken but heart still cold", at least not drowning in anger because of this state... Therefore, waiting for this period of time to pass with an indifferent expression was the best solution.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, onii-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was also angry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Twenty-four years is not yet fully mature.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was easy to mature, it wouldn't be so hard. "Adult" is not a license that comes automatically with age. Onodera Tatsuya is immature. Due to his age, he had to look mature, but he was actually just a kid with a yellow mouth and more than an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So he was annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Enough already-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya turned his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The eyes of the same Hinata, who was looking at this seriously, both eyes met.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I love you&#8221; (Note : Sukida)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya froze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of roaring laughter came from the classroom in the distance. Maybe some teachers tell jokes in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">tick-tick-tick-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The second hand of the clock on the wall made a shrill sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">dip-dip-</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of water dripping from the water heater faucet is also very loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sun's rays coming in through the cracks in the windows were dazzling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl who climbed out of the blanket and half stood looked into his eyes, as clean as a spring in the depths of a cave. Definitely like washing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There shouldn't be a long silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ten seconds?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, it should be five seconds or less. But this short time seemed very slow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, Tatsuya, who was not an adult, went blank. Even so, he racked his brains trying to find a way to respond. Should I just say it or something else, in short, I can't think of a word in my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Yes, there are downsides!" (note: in Japanese like is sukida, and minus is suki)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Immediately after.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya accepted the strangled hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And not just the usual hand strangle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya also accidentally knew that although Hinata was not very familiar with professional wrestling exhibition matches, and she was not old enough to watch a fight, this was a "flying cross chop" move. The arms are X-shaped, and they jump flamboyantly at each other. Legendary wrestler, Mil Mascaras pride trick.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hit the front.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aiming at the stunned Tatsuya, Hinata jumped off the bed like a rocket launcher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It didn't last for a second.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bang bang bang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The soft sound of the folding chair dropping to the floor sounded very melodious. Even though he wanted to quickly take up the defense, the back of his head was still hit hard. Golden star eyes. Consciousness was also interrupted for a moment. Tatsuya was relieved for the strange reason that this was an infirmary so that was too good. Any kind of emergency can be done here, and even a defibrillator is prepared for the worst. The chances of falling into life-threatening danger in this place were slim. If you fall into it, accept your fate. (A defibrillator is a defibrillator is a heart rate stimulator that uses high-voltage electricity to restore a victim of a heart attack.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahahaha!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata smiled indifferently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a state of suppressing Tatsuya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wait a moment onii-san. This is so funny&#8212;how did you fall so easily?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;What are you kidding me about?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya replied, shaking his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was embarrassed by the stars flying in front of him like a scene from a manga.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you know how tall you are? Aren't you almost the same height as me? What would happen if you got hit by a giant body like that? It's usually like this, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let me tell you first, I'm less than fifty kilograms. Onii-san, you're already over sixty kilograms, right? You've been fat since graduating college, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's one kilogram per year."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya stood up, blinking for a clear blur of vision. As he stood up, he extended his hand to Hinata to help her. Saying "thank you", Hinata held Tatsuya's hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hehehe, sorry brother. I got carried away."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're always like this. I am used to."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did you hit your head?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. But that's okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Should I call the nurse teacher? Should I go to the hospital? Should you be admitted to the ICU?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No need. At least go to the hospital when you feel bad. I don't want to die yet.... right, Hinata"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you like me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then "...pfft" she burst out laughing,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ughhhahaha! Brother, you're too self-conscious! I don't understand what you're talking about! So funny!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Why are you laughing??"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because, I didn't expect you to believe it as I thought. It's too funny to be so slow to hear "there are flaws" like "like you". Does that mean my brother is dissatisfied? Did you collect a lot?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is so annoying, I want you to take care of&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bell rings at this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ding dong ding dong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a sense this is the whistle at the end of the game. The time between the two of them, which felt like a long time had passed, was separated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Looks like gym class is over."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah. Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then I will return to class. I have to go to the next class.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">" Okay"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not. Thank you, Sensei, for staying with me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Right. In that case, I will go too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah. I have to explain the situation to your classmates. In this situation, if you go alone, it will be bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You stupid"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya patted the head of Hinata who was casually saying those words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata scrunched her neck "Ahahahaha it hurts".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It had turned back into the same Hinata as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just walk into class and briefly explain the situation to the students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Several worried classmates gathered around Hinata. Teshima Miyuu looked like she was crying, while Segawa Natsuki watched from a distance angrily. Everyone cares about Hinata in their own way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata and Tatsuya stopped by Ayaka's Toyota house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Tatsuya had an embarrassed expression on his face, Hinata was stubborn. Even though I thought of contacting me by phone, I still rang the doorbell of the Toyota house. After the entrance opened, before Ayaka and her mother could say anything, Hinata lowered her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The main thing to do here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Toyota mother and daughter who preceded were also affected and lowered their heads. After confirming that there was no need for compensation or responsibility, and that the school would not punish them, both Hinata and Ayaka went to school the next day as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can be said that it was resolved quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That day, the four of them, Hinata, Miyuu, Natsuki, and Ayaka, walked together. Hinata and Ayaka smiled at each other as if they were talking about something alone. The students who understood the atmosphere also tried their best to maintain their normal behavior, and this incident was resolved with a tacit understanding of "try not to touch it".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In general, not so easy to solve. In Tatsuya's view, this was one thing that Tsubakiya Hinata would resolve by giving full play to her crisis management skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is amazing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because it wasn't like that at first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because Tatsuya, an old friend, knew that a similar incident had been caused by Hinata before, but had never been resolved so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Meet with Tsubakiya Kanae, Hinata's mother whom we haven't seen in a long time, and report the whole story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I miss her a bit,&#8221; Kanae said with a smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, in a sense, I miss her, thought Tatsuya. Just a few years ago, this sort of thing was common&#8212;not yet, but that's not to say it's unusual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The young Tsubakiya Hinata, with her short hair flowing down, was uncontrollably in front of the child king.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Old, inconspicuous wounds were everywhere, and it wasn't just the one or two times I was taken to the hospital.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was also present in many cases.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe more than when her mother, Kanae, was there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I will ask you to look after my daughter from now on, Tatsuya-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kanae lowered her head, and Tatsuya had to agree.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She knew that this man was also working hard. The relationship between him and the Hinata family is much closer than "the others". The two families also take care of each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The same thing will happen many times from now on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Onodera Tatsuya is also one of the educators.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Guide students to grow by responding to their guardian's expectations, and relying on these to be delicious and spicy - if only that were possible. But those who do not work must not eat, and those who cannot produce results will not eat. Thinking about it carefully, Tatsuya was determined to help children like Tsubakiya Hinata, so he chose to become an educator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This level of hard work is not even hard work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was the path he had actively chosen. You have to do what you have to do carefully. Do the best.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the educator, this is what Onodera Tatsuya should be.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nervousness drained by every movement of students, pressure by supervisors and guardians, and being given exam questions and grading papers took up the whole day off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the future and in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Onodera Tatsuya will live like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a neighbor who is a bit difficult to deal with&#8212;a girl he's known since birth, whose destiny is to be his own disciple, and who stands out a bit from those around her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ehehe - onii-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is there any hair growing on my nipples?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the living room of the apartment where Onodera's house is located.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata suddenly said this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So what to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya pondered while pouring oil into the frying pan for the tempura.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it's "routine", Hinata is still very concerned about the content of the answer. Sure enough, thinking of the right answer is the right way to do it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How about Hinata's tone? How about facial expressions?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lying on the sofa carelessly, opening the library's eyes, what kind of answer are you looking for?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya chose to ignore it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pretending not to hear, he continued to prepare the fried tempura.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, onii-san, are you listening to me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hello, onii-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um what? Let me tell you about my situation? As for whether there is long hair or not, how about I&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait! Wait."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya turned around impatiently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do not bother me. Tempura is war. Even the slightest negligence can affect the beauty of the frying result. "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that more important than talking to students about the problem?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You too. Do you want to eat some good tempura?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My mom and I have also been to upscale tempura restaurants where one can fry good tempura while chatting with customers"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do not put amateurs and professionals. I am a person who will not fry without seeing the oil."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said Tatsuya, checking the temperature of the oil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sesame oil mixed with the spices is heated, and the aroma continues to come out. It's a scent that can't be described in words. When I was young, I could eat three bowls of rice with this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why don't you come and help me? Bring the fried tempura to the table. Then eat quickly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">First is the fried assortment. Celery and scallops are wrapped in tempura flour, wrapped in a special shape, then dipped in oil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hiss - shhh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In an instant, the wrapper was drenched in oil and puffed out what looked delicious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It looks good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Very delicious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;My onii-san's tempura is always delicious.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I have had many failed cooking experiences. I can't ignore it for a second before popping it in my mouth."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahaha. It's like a soldier who has endured many battles."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Stop talking, let me concentrate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He brought out an assortment of fries at just the right time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nice color. Pale golden yellow. The feeling of using chopsticks is not bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow&#8212;smells good&#8212;. Bon appetite!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, too bad. Don't eat here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But tempura is something that keeps getting worse after being fried.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And it's dangerous to have oil next to it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not a child and I'm not going to reach out and touch it. ...Ah, this is really good. The scallops were crushed, and the celery tasted just right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya didn't say anything else.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Frying tempura in silence. Once fried, I picked it up and ate it. Tatsuya tried it for the sake of taste. good to eat. Remove the beer from the refrigerator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Well, I heard that in the Edo period, tempura was eaten standing in front of a stall.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the food is good, chatting will be fun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not long after, the tempura was eaten up, and the two of them lay down on the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Thank you for your hospitality!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're welcome"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;You really can cook anything, onii-san&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;It's not like you can cook everything. Only you can cook what you have learned. When I was a student, I used to cook everything. I am obsessed with tempura. I don't have to spend too much if I fry it myself. You finally understand now. &#8230;So, I went to take a leisurely bath.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Is onii-san the type to grow hair on the nipples? Or not?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was not surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, worrying if you can escape by doing this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Is there a need to talk about it now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think it has anything to do with health and exercise."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it's necessary."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Weren't you talking about a similar topic recently??"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onii-san, it really wasn't easy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her eyes rolled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why should I be reprimanded by this person. Tatsuya was also dissatisfied. Maybe I should lash out at her once in a while. Maybe this little girl can calm down a bit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, no, this is unbelievable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Students and teachers, fourteen years and twenty-four years.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you think about it normally, the difference in the situation is obvious, no matter how you fight, you will only face the future of defeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is Tsubakiya Hinata too special?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Or is it just Onodera Tatsuya being too naive?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Onii-san, is it okay to undress here if necessary?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why? I won't let it go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah. Let's take a bath together after so long?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Are you trying to make me a criminal case?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That way, you can confirm all sorts of things. It really does vary. Pu hi hi hi!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She laughed at what she said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have absolutely no idea what's funny. Is this the kind of age that would be considered odd to turn around with chopsticks?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She's in this period now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still naive now. Only the body grows first, but the mind is immature.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But this moment would be discovered in the future&#8212;&#8212; Tatsuya had a hunch that her actions and expressions would eventually become a more distant existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No one has to stop it, no one can stop it, everyone will usher, cruel and gentle, the passage of time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya had been watching from a closer place than anyone else, so he understood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She will bloom in the end. Like a bud that blooms into a flower.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She will finally fly into the sky. Like a cocoon that turns into a butterfly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But not now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sooner or later it will help.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do your best to support this girl who is equal to his little sister, as she grows from a child to an adult. Even if something like the dispute a few days ago happened again &#8211; even though Tatsuya still did not know the cause of the dispute &#8211; he would always be behind the girl as a strong support.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, by the way, I haven't grown up yet. I don't have any hair down there either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;I don't need to know this kind of information.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe now I should start thinking about it. "One day".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking of this, Tatsuya sighed and thought hard about how to get past the crisis he was currently facing.</span></p>
