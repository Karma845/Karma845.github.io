<h3>Epilogue</span></h3><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hoshimura Yoichi, 12 years old. grade 6 elementary school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In class, he is considered relatively tall, his athletic ability is also good, and his learning is even stronger. Because he had read books, his knowledge reserves were richer than his peers. He has unique leadership skills, and his calm and calm aura is popular with girls and trusted among boys.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Considering his age, he is quite a child. If you want to say whether you have progressed, you have progressed a lot, and you are highly motivated, and you are very attracted to people who are higher than yourself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He doesn't have someone she's dating.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But now, he is in his first love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The story of that person was known many years ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Yoichi was in elementary school, he had already made a name at school. At a frequency of once a week, he caused some trouble, and he was called to the principal's office once a month. Fights were commonplace, destruction of public property and disturbance of class order. He's done pretty much every bad thing he can think of, and he's like a student like the big bad guys in the old movies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Incomprehensible violent maniac.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Obviously only less than two years older than her, but like a being of a different dimension.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Yoichi, who was in kindergarten not long ago, that person seemed like a creature from an alien planet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Six years have passed since then.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though they were in the same elementary school, they never had any contact with each other, but now there was little contact between Yoichi and her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, we meet today too"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah, hello"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a certain city, in a park not too far from a certain station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That day, Yoichi met "that person".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In elementary school, Yoichi was a freshman or two years old. Mominoki Academy Private Middle School, Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She sat beside the swing where Yoichi was sitting and opened the bag she was carrying. Inside was a pile of snacks that looked like they were bought from a convenience store. That's called the way to buy something to eat on the way to school. Generally this is unacceptable behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Want to eat?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, okay"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;There are potato chips, chocolate and candy qq. What do you want?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Potato chips."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There are two kinds of Calbee and Koikeya. Which would you like to eat?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did you buy both of them?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because I'm hungry. It's still a long time before dinner, it's really hard&#8212; at school you can't eat snacks-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. I'll get fat."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not going to be fat at all, I'm growing vertically left and right anyway."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata opened a bag of potato chips and handed it to Yoichi with a "hmm".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi extended his hand with a "thank you", and the potato chips fell into his hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Met her here a few months ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Due to his busy school, Yoichi often came to this park, and Tsubakiya Hinata often stopped by this park on his way from school. He noticed that everyone was from the same elementary school. After that, he would exchange a few words whenever they met. Yoichi and Hinata became such a relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Six o'clock in the afternoon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time in late May, the garden was so bright as if it needed no lighting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's with your face, are you hurt?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, a little"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Quarrel?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's right&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Too long, fighting"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, once in a while&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying so, Tsubakiya Hinata took out a book from her school bag and opened it. She often eats snacks and reads books to pass the time. Yoichi also focused his attention on the novel she brought. After learning that Tsubakiya Hinata suddenly likes reading, Yoichi also increased his reading volume. Different schools and different ages, for elementary school students, this is one of the few ways to get closer to her who is too far from him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi remembered what happened earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">About a week ago. At that time, I also met Tsubakiya Hinata in this park. What was different from usual was time. Not at night like today, but about the time to start paying attention to the counselor's presence. Yoichi came back from cram school by chance, while Tsubakiya Hinata said "Because my sister came home late."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Back then there was no sitting on the swing as I do today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was another person sitting on the swing. Young men and women in suits drank alcohol purchased from convenience stores and held banquets that did not save adults.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the large park near the station, there was a certain distance from the swing, so that even people with normal vision could not see the outline of the face clearly. But Yoichi is the person with the best eyesight in the class. He could clearly see the fact that the adults who were dressed were having a banquet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata had seen two adults.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there anything you care about?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Yoichi asked, she answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"They are the teachers at my school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's why, if that was the case, they would definitely care. If that was his position, Yoichi would definitely care. Then talk to the whole class the next day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Which is the teacher? Which girl? Or the male one?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Um&#8212;both&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, so they're dating right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Um&#8212;I don't know.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She said with a smile, watching the swing from a distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was like watching a unicorn caught from the forest quietly, without making a sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi also looked at this Tsubakiya Hinata again</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...The banquet lasted quite a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A man and a woman who had been drinking finally walked to the station together, and Tsubakiya Hinata also said "goodbye" and returned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi also followed into the house and told his sister what happened that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My older sister is a student at the private Mominoki Academy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8212;really!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The older sister was quite excited and noisy. Although Yoichi was a little regretful, it was better not to say it, but he felt that he couldn't help but itch himself. Presumably, even if he covered his mouth to prevent her from speaking, he would say it. It is still unknown what kind of relationship the drinking man and woman ended up having. Of course he doesn't want to ask Tsubakiya Hinata either</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;This happened a week ago,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi felt that he had not broken up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's just that the person you like seems to be making an appointment with a beautiful woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is very, very common. On the other hand, what do you expect from a woman who is in a different school, who is older than herself, and who has matured since elementary school?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's just that I meet occasionally in the park, and I say a few words. How much longing do I have?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Elle est retrouvée! Quoi? l'éternité. Finally found! What? Eternity"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata sat on the swing, reading a book, and suddenly muttered this sentence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What did you just say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi who was thinking was suddenly attacked and blinked his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um&#8212;it's poetry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Poetry? Poetry?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To say why, because Tsubakiya Hinata is so beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She had a face like a model or an actress, as if she had been chasing the current popularity all the time, as if she was following the women in Shibuya and Roppongi, who had that kind of impression on her. Of course, this was referring to the current Tsubakiya Hinata, although she felt a bit like a wild child in elementary school, but even so, Yoichi was still shocked. She. poetry. poetry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That Tsubakiya Hinata was reading poetry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata is reading poetry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait&#8212;? You're a little rude&#8212;?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You, aren't you putting on an expression that doesn't suit you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Impossible"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the time you acted suspiciously, you were already out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You bastard" Hinata pinched his ear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sick." Yoichi twisted his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata smiled "Ahaha"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I'll admit it's trendy, but I've always found this poem to be pretty good. So I've been fascinated by it lately."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whose poem is this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Rimbo&#8221; (note: the conversation between Hinata and Miyuu in chapter 2)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've heard of it"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This isn't the movie, you know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I still know it so far"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">False.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first thing that comes to mind is the face of the famous action star.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But it is true that the name of the poet has been heard. Talented young poet, or something. Maybe the type of person who is jealous of talent and lives in poverty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Elle est retrouvée! Quoi?l'éternité finally found! What? Eternity"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata looked back at the book and repeated it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"C'est la mer mêlée Au soleil is the sea, one with the sun"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...What language is this"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"French"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Extraordinary"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi admired her honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even the mere act of reciting a poem has distanced the distance, so I kept reading it in the original text.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's really cool."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that really cool?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Very cool."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi nodded respectfully, while Tsubakiya Hinata smiled "ahaha",</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Well, I guess this is the only poem I can understand.&#8212;&#8212;Though I've been reading other people's poetry for now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've read it for now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;However &#8211; I always felt that this poem was the only thing that caught my attention. Even though it's just the beginning&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about beyond the start?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, because it looks cooler, doesn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Obviously it's a poem you don't understand at all?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I still understand the beginning of this poem!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata insisted on her own proposal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She looked and behaved like an adult, but right now she looked like a child.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi didn't really understand. In the second grade of junior high school, adults or children?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So? What does this poem mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Clearing her throat, she read the translation with great emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Finally found / what? / Eternity is the sea / Merging with the sun.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hey? Don't you think it's great? Don't you think it's great?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't understand the meaning at all. Whether it's France or Japan, the impression doesn't change.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even though he didn't understand, he still felt something that he wanted to attract.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And there is an impression. Sunset and twilight. Close but out of reach. That is absolutely impossible to achieve. But it's something I want to hold in my hands no matter what.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...It feels good"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't that right? Isn't that right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can you read it again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Real? Or Japanese?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then read it in French."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;After memorizing it, allow me to read Rimbaud's gist to you. Elle est retrouvée! Quoi?l'éternité&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata started reading aloud with a proud expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi looked at her profile.</span></p>


<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjAVVWt27f-84stZVMd32GsgGqdCEuuDRASMGFfhqO6TqQzGSkeAEiCwDUt1DNFNkTSpqyGkvKg1m8KiTOCuMkhZKf-UEGK3BpWWTQ0N8_qzPrkemqUOgUwvpZQ6A_0qP_J2w8ZDnnhKe6cmqVvcTpGqJ4l1nkneOL3wC7B_KMsH8OOU0zGhq4CLN7V=s16000"></>


<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Whenever she wanted to pretend to be a mature sister, she would say something like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, I'm talking about you. Do you know when a woman becomes beautiful?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To the omniscient older sister, Yoichi replied, &#8220;When? &#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Isn't that easy? That's when you fell in love with her!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He, writhing uncomfortably, declared, 'Ah-ah! I also want to hurry up and talk about very strong loves! "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Be happy," thought Yoichi at that time. The feeling is a little different now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He thought so while looking at Tsubakiya Hinata's profile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps, the people closest to her didn't know. Family members or classmates in the class, or even those around them, didn't know it, and they definitely didn't realize it now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The buds have already bloomed for flowers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cocoons spend the spring and turn into colorful butterflies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Dancing casually in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Elle est retrouvée! Quoi&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh? Wow, do you remember?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've heard it many times. What's next?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"l'éternité. C'est la mer mêlée Au soleil "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;C'est la mer mlée Au soleil&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait&#8212;? Why are you memorizing so quickly? Do you want to memorize the back of it too? So do you want to lend me the book?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi saw her innocent smile and became proud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And then he thought - if there is a fool who doesn't notice that her buds bloom and her cocoons turn into butterflies, it must be her own doing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since adults are idiots, they will soon forget. I myself was once a child. The time to look up at tall, bulky adults would be over before I knew it, and by the time I realized I had become the position of an adult looking down on others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The boy will also be a junior high school student next year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first option is the private Mominoki Academy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, she would be able to stand on the same ground as her. It doesn't matter who she's dating. It wasn't close combat in the first place, so what if it was a bit of a disadvantage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you have someone you like?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yoichi is attacked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata smiled slightly as she peeked at a boy whose fighting spirit lit up in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, that's right, you look like this. I understand it very well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nothing like that"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't there~? Actually, there must be~"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really not. Not really."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if his pace was slightly faster than the people around him, Hoshimura Yoichi was still a child and still not mature enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But one day she will, too, and become a different version of herself.</span></p>
