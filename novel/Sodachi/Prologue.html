<h3>Prologue</b></span></h3></div><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nice to meet you, I'm Tsubakiya Hinata."</span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shivering feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With just that simple greeting, the whole atmosphere changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the second year of class A, in junior high school - Mominoki Private Academy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is spring weather. The opening ceremony ends at 11.00. In a new class with new friends, the first homeroom period is held. Of course, there is no shortage of time for students to introduce themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I was in class C in my freshman year. I didn't join any club. I don't have any particular interests, but I quite like reading."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The female student's attitude seemed to emit light.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just standing still, it was as if rays of bright light were emanating from her body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Spring is also the season of new encounters. From here, you can see the cherry blossom trees through the open windows. The flower petals dance to the rhythm of the wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;There were a few who were in the same class as me last year, but there may be many more who will become new classmates. So in the coming year, I look forward to your help.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like that, she&nbsp;ended her speech.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He didn't forget to make a very precise stooping posture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The atmosphere in the class changed. The sound of silence, even the sound of holding her breath. The voices just blended together, spreading in the hearts of every student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[&#8230;The next student who introduces himself will be under a lot of pressure.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The homeroom teacher Onodera Tatsuya sighed in frustration. Students must introduce themselves next, no matter what they do, they can't compare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl is extraordinary, for better or for worse, both are extraordinary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shiny black hair, eyes that emit light that fascinates one, slim figure, flawless skin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Above all is height. She&nbsp;is taller than other students her age, the numbers prove it. 172cm is a number that exceeds the average height of a boy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the outside, she&nbsp;looked like an adult. However, her facial features still had a hint of immaturity left...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That magical balance made one implicitly see that her appearance was completely unsuitable for her age.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, everyone knows it, everyone feels it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That this girl is not normal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That she&nbsp;was clearly just a child like the others, but something was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That in the not too distant future, she&nbsp;would become a certain character that no one else could reach... No, perhaps she&nbsp;had completely become a "character" there by now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He made eye contact with Tsubakiya Hinata who was sitting in the middle of the class. <i>naughty </i>...</span></p><p></p>

Something that only Onodera Tatsuya recognized.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In that short time, she&nbsp;returned to being a [Ordinary Child like the rest]. A child once ran around the village with an insect catching racket in her hand, not knowing if it was a boy or a girl. Then, as the child grows up, the child will feel tortured and uncomfortable whenever she&nbsp;tries to explain her way of thinking in the past every time she&nbsp;looks back at the past.<br />Second year of junior high school.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is middle age, no longer a bud, but not yet blooming into a flower.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It was like an intricately processed candy, something fragile and fragile, but also a creature of indescribable beauty.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And then, the student self-introduction period ended abruptly.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there was much to be said, this place was not suitable for a homeroom teacher to speak.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Towards young faces - pioneers for future generations in the near future, secretly hoping for peaceful things to come, she&nbsp;gave some typical words of encouragement like in a book.</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"The road you are on in the future will be very difficult, so in the next year, let's work together."</span></p><p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">
