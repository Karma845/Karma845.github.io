<h3>Chapter 1</b></h3>That night.</span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the apartment where Onodera Tatsuya lives.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, hey, onii-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How was that done?" (TLN: 'that' refers to 'making love')</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Spring is also the season of love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The stray cats outside continued to scream loudly, the dove, which was originally a symbol of peace, puffed up its cheeks and rushed over for territory. After all, June, the month of marriage, is drawing near, even humans are no exception.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That is, it is mating season. All living things fight with each other for their lives, with the aim of finding the other half and continuing the race.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So it's not uncommon for questions like this to arise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Onodera Tatsuya only answered lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go and check for yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"HI? I didn't understand after checking, so I asked you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How did that happen? Take out your phone and browse a few times and you'll be out soon. If you find it too intrusive, just go to the Yahoo forums and ask, just wait, if you have some free time, people will come and answer."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hai? But I'm so embarrassed..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm busy cooking dinner. If you bother me again, I'll cut your dinner portion."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hai...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata pouted in discontent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Dragging a chair into the kitchen and sitting on it, resting her chin on the back of the chair, Hinata started spinning like a horse in an amusement park...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But, aren't you a teacher?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, it's a teacher. A teacher of the national language. So health and sports education are not my areas of expertise."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know that you don't teach health and sports, but starting this year you are also homeroom teacher."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"As if I have the right to refuse, then, I'll ask to transfer to a class without you..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;The homeroom teacher's job is to answer students' questions, right? Sex education is also considered a question, shouldn't you answer it wholeheartedly?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You are the kind of person who makes the difference between public and private."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But I'm only a middle school student, right? Only fourteen? still puberty?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, I've known you since you were a baby."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;That's all, so it's only natural that I'm interested in sex. Isn't it the responsibility of adults to prepare proper sex knowledge for minors? It doesn't matter if you're homeroom or not, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mouth is good, Tatsuya sighed exasperatedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He used to be so honest and cute. Perhaps the reason why "that" Tsubakiya Hinata became like this was due to the influence of the people around her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, Hinata."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Putting the crumbs on the pork, she&nbsp;said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There is a concept called 'adult's heart' in this world, you know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know, I'm still young, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"According to that 'adult's heart', to answer my question, I have to prepare mentally, have background knowledge and several other things."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. So it's fine not to prepare beforehand."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So it's fine to prepare in advance, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think you can say it's instant, it's not that easy. Ah... I'm sorry. Actually I also want to answer you, but I can't do it if I don't prepare beforehand. I'm so sorry, so sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So have you ever done 'that' before?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This kid doesn't listen to me at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He grimaced in annoyance, but Tatsuya was a teacher, so he&nbsp;knew very well how to handle a situation like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No comment!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha? Onii-san ran away!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not running away, this is how adults handle the situation."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But you're only twenty-four, aren't you? Then you must have done it, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who knows..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, tell me~ This is my lifelong wish~&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Almost done. Even if you and I are old neighbors who have known each other, it's not like a teacher would tell all that to his students."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, sexual harassment detected!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Your words that insulted me&#8230; Well, about to fry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkatsu">tonkatsu</a>, how about now? By the way, I'm not responsible if the meat accidentally burns."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yes&#8230; Then let me prepare the plate.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally escaped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Hinata who was excitedly returning to the dining room, Tatsuya let out a small sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lately, it has become more difficult to respond to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl was still a child, biting her ear and cuddling was like food to her. Basically, she&nbsp;just had to deal with it as she&nbsp;pleased, these kinds of things were familiar to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, once you get used to it, why is it so difficult?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason is very simple, although she&nbsp;is still a child inside, but her appearance is no different from that of an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fourteen year old, junior high school girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A family member from the next door neighbor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Cheerful, lively, healthy are the three characteristics that characterize hers. Until recently she&nbsp;was still a bad girl with tan skin, running around the neighborhood with bug catcher racket in hand, leading the kids into trouble.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It looks so messy that I don't like it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But whatever you say, everyone will change.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl had developed very quickly in the past few years, her arms and legs were long and slender, her height rose like bamboo shoots, and her facial features were also more mature than you could see at a glance. The same goes for the rest of the body, of course, and many other things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She looks exactly like her mother, who owns a well-run shop in Ginza. If walking down the street, ten out of ten people would turn their heads to look at it. After all, anyone with good eyesight should of course turn around and see a girl with long straight hair, seven feet tall, leisurely strolling down the street.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Girls change very fast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was an often used idiom, but Tatsuya had no idea that a girl could change this much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, hey, onii-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up and eat, the meat is cold now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onii-san, forced to be homeroom teacher in my class, are you upset?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata's appearance far exceeded that of an ordinary junior high school student. It was thought that it was a high school student all day, so that the request for a reduction in tuition was not approved, it was just a routine matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the inner soul cannot keep up with the rapid development of the body. She&nbsp;still doesn't know how to keep her distance from others, her immaturity in behavior shows. Besides, the life experience needed was only temporary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It does not matter." said Tatsuya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, she&nbsp;sprinkled the sauce over the chopped tonkatsu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Even though it's not fun, it turns out that there are a lot of troublesome things. Even though my relationship with you isn't shady, outsiders don't think so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's no way a fourteen-year-old girl could stay in the house of a young man in his twenties, eat there every day, and drag her home late at night, sometimes even falling asleep until morning."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for taking care of me all this time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;No matter how you look at it, it is full of unusual points. Students and teachers, adults and minors. If any teacher out there did something like this, I would call the police to the ward without hesitation."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I used to be like this, didn't I?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata said as she put the piece of meat on top of the rice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">True to her words, this wasn't a situation that just started recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them had been like this for the past ten years. Because the neighborly relationship between the two families was also quite close, so whenever Hinata's mother left, Tatsuya would take care of her child as a matter of course. It was hard to say that taking care of them wasn't troublesome, but for a family that didn't have a daughter like the Onodera family, her appearance was like that of a little angel.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition, Tatsuya's parents retired early, then moved to a Southeast Asian country to recuperate. Too bad I live alone in such a big family apartment, I'd rather let Hinata come and take care of her so I don't feel sad. Her family had already said so, so she&nbsp;couldn't insist on refusing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Tatsuya let go of it and took things like this as a matter of course.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, Hinata was a good boy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though there were still many problems&#8212;whether there were different problems in the past or today&#8212;he was still a kind-hearted boy as she&nbsp;appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not to mention the maturation process that burned the stage, she had received proper protection and protection, and turned into such a shining girl, Tatsuya could puff out his chest with pride that half of his life was over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Quite good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's more than adequate, but...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I was very happy when I found out that you were my homeroom teacher.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Filling a throat full of rice and fried pork until both cheeks puffed up, Hinata continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Having someone I know helps me feel better, and we've known each other for a long time, so I shouldn't hesitate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;No, don't be afraid to help me. Behave in an acceptable manner. At school, you and I are just teachers and students. There's nothing special here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I already know clearly, why you keep reminding. However, there are many advantages, but there are many things that the teacher is not comfortable talking about. In addition, I can also survey the situation of other students in the class through you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh yes, this is true."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Having you is better, right? It's only the second year since becoming a teacher that you have accepted the homeroom position. What is your risk of being bullied by students in class? It's hard for you to sort things out on your own, isn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know how to take people down, don't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Look, but don't worry, I'm here. How about a little gratitude?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;For now, I acknowledge the value of your existence.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then help me with my homework."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hai!? Agreed, I also helped you with your homework back then, didn't I?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Times have changed, I am different now. Besides, I'm also busy. Need to prepare for exams, mark exams, and have to prepare lesson plans. Not to mention, she&nbsp;should also care about helping students who have school problems. The students have a problem, did you hear that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you suddenly looking at me when you say that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh no, who knows what? In short, homework is done alone. Your job is to try to be of little use, in return, I'll treat you to a delicious tonkatsu, got it? Isn't the contract profitable?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's the benefit? No matter how I look, I'm the one who suffers?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I'll give you a piece of my meal. Can you agree?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Oh, hey, hey? Bribing students is not good.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is a private matter, not a public issue. You also have to learn how to handle situations based on circumstances.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ehehe... Then I won't hold back!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying that, Hinata took the tonkatsu from Tatsuya's plate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(How can there be such a bad heart)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While washing dishes in the kitchen, Tatsuya thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl next door, whom he&nbsp;considered his sister for so long, suddenly grew over the years, but her soul did not grow at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now you have to raise the child as a civil servant?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know this kid named Tsubakiya Hinata is a bit special, but there must be cases like this all over the country. As a teacher, he&nbsp;feels happy to be able to contribute something in his current position.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, in junior high school educational work, such problems are not uncommon. However, there are no books that record how to handle such situations. After all, the problems involved that can arise are countless, so it's hard to ask for the necessary instructions to be made, but at least something should be suggested. Otherwise, sooner or later those involved will have to bear the consequences of force majeure. This had nothing to do with the fact that he was a teacher, Tatsuya only wanted to discuss the above matters with her as a relative. Now that he is a homeroom teacher, he must mentally prepare and be more determined than ever to keep up with the little girl...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hai!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pop...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Aiming straight at Tatsuya's back, Hinata made a surprise attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Says "attack", but not the kind of knife to hit someone just out of love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's just a hug. A gentle hug from behind Tatsuya while he was washing the dishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ehehe..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He felt Hinata pressing her face against his back, rubbing her back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then she&nbsp;spoke sweetly, like a pimping puppy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Surprise attacks from time to time. How&#8212;how, have you given up? Surrender obediently, onii-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hinata."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can't do this at school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, I'm not that childish."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you're tired of the game, then let me go. Don't bother the adults doing the dishes. You've grown so big, and you probably weigh almost as much as I do."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Too much talking! I try to eat and exercise in moderation to keep the weight at 50 kg.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, let go. This is really annoying."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Refused. It's been a long time since I hugged like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hold on tight!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata suddenly clenched her fists, like she was participating in a professional wrestling tournament.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pressed on his back by her precocious breasts, Tatsuya's heart showed no sign of disturbance. If it's really messed up, don't tell the teacher, even Tsubakiya Hinata's neighbor is not qualified.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/9ZHgjRq/10.jpg" alt="10" border="0"></a>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hinata."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I am here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you don't release me soon, I will use my role as teacher to force you to clean the toilet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't you say to act according to the circumstances?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I'm an adult, so I have rights. That's all, if you count to three and don't let go, I'll ask you to clean the toilet. One two..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tch, that's boring..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just leave it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sticking out her face from the side, the little girl smiled wryly, looking at Tatsuya's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them are only two centimeters high. The little girl looks like an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey onii-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata smirked, a bright smile that didn't contain any blemishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her smile was no different from the children with dirt-stained faces playing in the park.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can you feel my chest against your back?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What nonsense are you talking about again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Also if you do lewd things alone, just remember this feeling."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Subconsciously, Tatsuya stopped washing his dishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eyes wide, where did this girl learn such things from, but who would dare to teach her such a thing?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hinata."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for today! I'm going home to do my homework!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Children are very sensitive when they feel like they are going to be scolded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Turning like a swallow, the girl ran to the door. The legs are still as nimble as ever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After washing all the dishes, Tatsuya plopped down on the sofa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He took out a can of beer that was hard to drink in front of Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Turning on the TV switch, he turned on the channel that was showing all sorts of nonsensical shows.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata has a tall body, her limbs are also very slender and slender.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her slimness is even more visible from the clothes she wears. That's why even her breasts are bigger than they look. The reason why people had to turn their heads when walking on the street wasn't just because she was tall, or had a pretty face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But so what?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He had known Hinata since she&nbsp;was a baby. She&nbsp;even changed her diaper many times. After all, the two would forever be neighbors, at most he only saw Hinata as his sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He thought as he opened his second beer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Knowing that he had a lot of sadness in his heart, but like him, those around him also suffered from unspeakable sorrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was troubled by the difference between outward appearance and inner soul, on the other hand, Tatsuya had to fight for the honor of an adult. In general, each side has its own suffering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But after all, shouldering more hardships than it should be accepted, it is also the responsibility of adults.</span></p>
