<h3><b>Chapter 7</b></span></h3><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya-san, is she dating someone?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fujimoto Asuka asked while putting the premium beef back on the grill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Short hair in a women's suit. Very refreshing and feminine style.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, she was quite capable. When I was in college, my grades were very good, and I was immediately appointed an English teacher, clean, tidy, and refreshing. She was the type of person who was too capable but made it a little difficult for men to approach. Has been appointed as a student mentor at a young age.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. She&nbsp;probably isn't dating anyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said Onodera Tatsuya in denial while moving the roast beef liver onto his plate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After work, at the barbecue shop down the street about two stops from school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya and Asuka were chatting happily over the charcoal fire oven.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;At least I haven't heard of who Tsubaki-san is dating. I don't think I have that feeling either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it was a sensitive topic about students, it had to be kept secret.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that warning, Asuka said in a low voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sometimes I hear strange rumors about Takayama-san in third grade."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Takayama - Takayama Kaito. Student from the athletic club."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"She&nbsp;confessed to Tsubakiya-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh&#8212;!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was completely taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No kidding, this is a real feat. Tatsuya couldn't do a special attack like that. It's impossible to do that now as an adult, much less in high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's really like him, Takayama-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Right&#8212;that's pretty bold."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This is the first person to confess to Tsubakiya-san.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How many. I don't know the situation of all the students. There might be more."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But they gave up on confessing, there might be such a person."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;They deliberately approached but did not dare to confess. Maybe there are more people like that.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;There are more boys who come here as a side dish. Ahaha!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka said casually while drinking Beer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka, who was too capable and rejected by people thousands of miles away, was difficult for men to approach, perhaps for this reason. In schools and workplaces that often turn into a male society, if you are not careful to a certain extent, you may not be able to do so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, Onodera-kun, you&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka looked at Tatsuya disdainfully,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I feel like you're exaggerating?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Etto&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka was holding a beer cup,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;For example, If it's from a safe area? Holding a red wine glass in one hand, seeing the plight of the people below? I don't know why I can feel it from Onodera-kun, your condescending gaze.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is it about Hinata?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm talking about Tsubakiya-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya placed the beef liver on the grill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The temperature of the roast beef liver is very important, if it is overcooked, it will not taste good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Fujimoto-senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you stupid?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What did you say-!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka raised her eyebrows.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya did not back down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hinata is like my little sister. It's just like my family. I've never treated her as a woman. The condescending gaze is really cute. Better to say what kind of gaze you used to look at me, senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I saw it with the eyes of my comrades! And then there are my ex-boyfriend's eyes!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka Fujimoto, 26 years old.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">An English teacher who works at the junior high school at the private Mominoki Academy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Tatsuya, she was two years older than him in college, a senior at the club he joined, and now a senior at work. The two of them were not in a relationship between senior and junior, they only had a brief courtship period as a couple.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, even though she's your little sister, she's the one living with you, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Sh</span><span style="font-size: large;">e's the next door neighbor's kid."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But she comes to your house every day, right? you guys eat together, right? And at school. You're still her homeroom teacher, so you'll definitely meet her. If that's the case, won't you surpass the family? This is the era when there are many people who don't meet even if they are family?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Asuka spoke, she transferred the beef liver to her plate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This is the meat I roasted.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya didn't say that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Discreetly put a piece of beef liver on the grill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka was still unsettled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In other words, a condescending gaze speaks of this kind of place. You and Tsubakiya-san spend more time together than any other family member, and you know her better than anyone else. This kind of serenity is slowly starting from Onodera-kun. It radiates outward. The same goes for speech, one might even say that it radiates from the whole body."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if I don't understand that person at all,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya wanted to say that, but he gave up. He wasn't very young, and he was much more mature than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;As far as I know, the time with her after she grew up was very short.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How do you say it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? You've known her since Tsubakiya-san was born."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Indeed, maybe I'm the one who knows her the most so far. Because I took care of her."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But ever since I came back from four years of college alone, that girl has thrived. Like a foreigner. I feel like Urashima Taro. So where did she come from? In other words, it's like starting over with a complete stranger."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see, this seems to be the case"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can you take it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Half and half. Gave you a piece of meat. Let's eat."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank You"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya accepted the beef liver that Asuka had given him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This is the meat I put on the grill.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya didn't say anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Half-cooked beef liver is served with beer, and its sweet taste will satisfy your taste buds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;But it's actually really hard&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Tsubakiya-san too, and you, Onodera-kun too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka rubbed the rim of the beer cup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Even though I know Onodera-kun, you don't want to be Tsubakiya-san's homeroom teacher, but no one else can. But maybe whoever was the homeroom teacher wouldn't have anything to do with the kid. Even if it's bad manners. etc. Not at all, but I always felt that child was different. Even if it was an adult, she would be wary. I might not be able to educate her casually.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya felt the same way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for why, even Tatsuya himself felt the same way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In an unintentional moment, Hinata's behavior and expression seemed to have turned into a kind of unreachable existence, and Tatsuya had such a hunch. This cannot be stopped by anyone, and must not be stopped by anyone. Tatsuya's intuition told him that this was a very natural development trend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One day she will fly high. Like breaking a cocoon and becoming a butterfly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Watching this moment, Tatsuya would be happy to help her as long as he could be her support. It would be wrong to say that there wouldn't be any complicated feelings, but after all, he had watched Tsubakiya Hinata grow since birth. Tatsuya did not wish to entrust this responsibility to anyone other than himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, anytime you want to discuss it with me, I'd be happy to help you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka said while stirring the meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Although my experience isn't very rich, it's still longer than your time as a teacher, Onodera-kun. If you are a girl, there will be more things you can empathize with.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Are you planning to blackmail this junior of yours?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on, it will be better."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka smiled cutely and said to the attendant,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"One more beer!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A senior two years older than the college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Participate in the same society.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then she was Tatsuya's ex-girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all this, it would be a lie to say that there would be no emotion, but Fujimoto Asuka still had the advantage of being "clean, tidy, and fresh". Tatsuya shouldn't be led by the nose with his past sentimentality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Drizzle beef liver with plenty of sauce and eat it with white rice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry! I want another drink!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I will rest tomorrow. A little pleasure will not be punished.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Do you remember Kudo-senpai?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you indulge yourself, there will be a second encounter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka opened a can of sake and brought up a new topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Kudou-senpai is a person who is three years older than me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yes, the person who became the beautiful club president.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course Tatsuya remembered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Tatsuya went to college and joined the Western Music Research Association, Kudo Yoko-senpai had just become the chairman, and she held the club introduction meeting as if she wasn't too used to it. She put aside her premiere activities, went to about a hundred live shows a year, and studied for a doctorate in English literature.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Kudo-san, what's wrong with her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Yes, it's Yoko-san. It looks like she will be getting married this year.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was completely taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He asked as he lifted the bottle to brew sake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who is she married to? As far as I know, the person Yoko-san is related to... Is that Tashiro-senpai? The one from the rugby club."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's Yoshimoto-san? The one who works as a teaching assistant in Murayama's laboratory"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Pfft&#8212;it's not&#8212;yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Male relationship."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Narahashi-kun. The person who is at the same time as me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? What's Narahashi? He keeps collecting Kurt Cobain, the skinny guy with glasses?" (Note: Kurt Donald Cobain, American singer, formed the Nirvana Band)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's Narahashi-kun. Anyway, isn't that too rude? Onodera-kun, what do you think?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Sorry for not paying attention. But it was Narahashi-senpai. Ya-haha-ohh-&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a residential street park.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It wasn't too far from Tatsuya's apartment, and closer to going to Asuka's house, which meant being in the middle of each other's residences. The two of them sat on two swings each and drank canned drinks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How do you say it, everyone is moving forward."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Onodera-kun, you just graduated two years ago, right? How do you feel, like an uncle?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually already uncle. From the point of view of a 24-year-old junior high school student, it looks like an existence above the clouds or it resembles something from outer space."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you say that, then what about the 26 year old me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka rolled her eyes and looked at Tatsuya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya swayed on the swing with a feigned expression of ignorance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Narahashi-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, are you still talking about this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't look at him like that. In fact, he is an engineer that Google can invite. It's also to be expected that Kudo-senpai will transfer overseas soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Was the wedding also held overseas?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm&#8212;I don't know? But there's a possibility."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wow&#8212;if I'm invited to Hawaii or something, I'd better leave it alone. But first, I have to ask for leave, and second, I have to give a generous gift, right? Oh, it's hard, it's so hard."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onodera-kun, did you make up the premise that you would be invited?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well prepare mentally first. Recently, people around me are getting married more and more.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I understand--! Then I became anxious&#8212;&#8212;! This is so bad--!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka leaned forward.&#8221; Ha ha." He laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya turned his head,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean by being anxious?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You...wait, you, is it appropriate to say something like that at a time like that? Even though I'm the one who brought up this topic. On the other hand, I hope you can be more positive at times like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So what do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;So&#8230;! I will think about this kind of thing&#8212;! If the people around me start getting married, of course I will bless them. Yes, but I feel like this matter will be closely related to me! That means getting married!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya took a sip of wine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;This shouldn't be something you worry about, senpai. If you want, there should be a lot of suitors. It's just that you don't have that thought.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh, is that so?? Is that true? No, if that's the case&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you ashamed of?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I am not ashamed! By the way, how about you, Onodera-kun? Does any girl feel good? Besides Tsubakiya-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, there is no such thing as a "good girl" at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be better to say that since the beginning of the university period, I was completely out of touch with that aspect.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Two years after becoming a teacher. Over time, I've been too busy to tackle a job I'm not familiar with, and really don't have time to maintain good relationships with women. I have to look after the students at school, and I have to look after Hinata when I get home. In between, doodling on exam questions, checking student notes&#8212;not even playing social games on the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But this must be just an excuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how busy people are, they can manage their own life well once they handle the things they have to do well. There are many people like that. Kudo-senpai was like this, and so was Narahashi-senpai.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then looking back how about Onodera Tatsuya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you do all kinds of things that relate to yourself well? Exactly as he said, 24 years old or something really uncle. I can not keep the mood of my student days all the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Everyone is moving forward."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya squeaked on the swing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bend your knees into your legs, then straighten them. Now that he was an adult, he could have a lot of potential energy with just a slight swing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I also have to move forward&#8212;so as not to be left behind by you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I understand! I understand this&#8212;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka excitedly echoed grumbling words that had no significance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She's also on the swing. Creaky. Suddenly, it surpassed Tatsuya's height.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I also want to advance--ah. I don't want to be left behind--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm, let's work harder"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah yeah- don't leave me where--don't be so anxious--if you want to go ahead, just follow me--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really changed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm so sick of it&#8212;I'll go out with my own selfishness&#8212;if you care too much about something like modesty and arrogance, and don't want to do what you did. You'll regret it later&#8212;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe as she said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But what exactly is this talking about? It seems meaningful, and it seems empty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, everyone's a little drunk. Let every word you say make sense, and there will be no such thing. If the stress that builds up in the workday can be released to some extent, if everyday problems can be reduced to some extent, and if it can be an opportunity to move forward in a positive way, this will suffice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, but it's about getting married,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course it's been a long time? There's no need to push or worry, and I haven't really done anything like that yet? Don't look at me, I'm a very tolerant woman too, I guess I think I'm the wait-and-see type, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tell me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see, it's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then&#8212;what, Tatsuya-kun, you don't have a girlfriend, do you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. I just said that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? Well, I'm just asking now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm at the same workplace as you, Tatsuya-kun, so I'm still a little worried, but it's been almost two years, I feel a little calm, maybe the timing is right, I'm asking because I'm a little worried about other people's femininity."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I asked you to come for a drink today, and you also came, even though I said that, it's not the first time I've gone out for drinks since I took office. But even so, Tatsuya-kun, are you staying with me like this? Even if you're not ready, maybe the time is right. This is what I wanted to ask you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Senpai, are you drunk?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I must be drunk! I've had too much to drink!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, no, no, no way, Tatsuya thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When she was a college student, Asuka was famous for her alcohol intake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've often heard the legend that he drank a pint of wine and looked like a normal person, surrounded by drunken men who looked like they were everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you don't use such means to open your mouth to court while you are drunk, it will spoil the faces of the teachers and make Tatsuya feel ashamed. in various senses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Could it be Tatsuya-kun, you're not drunk?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I was drunk, because I drank with you, senpai. On the other hand, I reluctantly paid attention to not get drunk.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? Tatsuya-kun you are very cunning. You keep getting girls drunk and you stay in the safe zone. "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If there's a safe zone, then it's true. After all, there isn't one now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;What? &#8212;!? This is true! Ahaha!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She stopped the swinging swing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Drink the rest of the wine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That&#8212;, that&#8212;ah"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka lowered her head and nodded.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...?"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya peeked into her expression, and under the dim lighting of the garden, Tatsuya saw his ex-girlfriend's face turning red.</span></p><p></p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you going home, going home?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go home? Senpai, is your house?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This time the turn came and stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh, what to do. Senpai's house? It shouldn't be far from here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;No, don't misunderstand!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka panicked, not knowing how to understand Tatsuya's pause.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come over to my house and continue drinking! I really have no other intentions! Since going to the store is also very expensive, I've spent a lot of money on this barbecue today, and drinking in the garden is also worth it. . It's almost like that&#8212;&#8212;, that's why I suggested it! Um, really&#8212;&#8212; Tatsuya-kun, you're a man after all&#8212;&#8212;! Really&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, I'm not talking about that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Then what are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;It's almost time to worry about Hinata. If you leave that girl alone, she won't be able to sleep every time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah-!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Covering her eyes with her right hand, she kept waving her left hand,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;really&#8212;okay, I see, I see. The fact that it was I who underestimated you to pick up the princess here. I see, I'll also try to understand your position, Onodera-kun, so it's better to shut up and go home or be exiled"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe I'm being chased?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Ah- !&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like an old man in a small town, she keeps--! What--!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey Onodera-kun"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A place like yours, a place like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tatsuya was taken aback by the perfectly high voice and closed his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;really&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka pretended to drink. But it seemed, the can in her hand was empty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you doing!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Are you leaving then? (Note: The original Japanese text here means go and disband, and go and carry on.)&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on okay. Ah, let's disperse. Sorry, I asked you to accompany me until now, but I won't apologize to you! Next time I will ask you to drink again, please tell me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about going to the next store"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;So I said that I would go to the next shop where I would continue drinking later. I would meet three times. There seems to be a place near the station where you can drink until late at night. you going?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Are you going?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't you invite me, senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about Tsubakiya-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Send her a message. That person isn't a kid anymore. Tomorrow is a day off after all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is it better to go to Senpai's house?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Well, no, yes, really? It's quite late, right? But the room still hasn't been cleaned! Don't look at me as a woman!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka waved her hand &#8220;ahaha&#8221; and got up from the swing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's go! It's a hundred times better than just going home! I'll be drinking until this morning&#8212;!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He actually drank with her until morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka's drinking capacity seemed to be young, and Tatsuya was exhausted trying not to drink until he fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I only remember a tenth of what we talked about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The topic that was repeated the most was Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Asuka seemed to be thinking about this flashy student who had the absolute advantage in school. In her words, it might be "not just me, there are all the teachers in the school". Just like this, Tsubakiya Hinata's presence was already very strong. Even if she wasn't in the class where he was homeroom, he had to pay attention to it. If you want to say the reason, it's just that other students also pay attention to Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Isn't this too much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But this was probably because only Tatsuya and Hinata had such an extreme relationship. Thin and fragile, said the English teacher Asuka, it was a child from the "fragile" era.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had to remember it as best I could&#8212; Tatsuya thought about it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And while thinking so, the seeds of trouble have been sown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And those who sowed the seed did not know it.</span></p>
