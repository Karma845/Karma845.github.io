<h3><b>Chapter 6</b></span></h3><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;ah. I really wanted to fall in love&#8212;recently,"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki, second year student A, student number 20, grumbled.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Natsuki, do you have someone you like?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Said Toyota Ayaka, a sophomore grade A girl, student number 23, stirring the eggs with a whisk.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"No, it's annoying because I don't have one,"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki grumbled while cutting the lettuce.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;The one from the same elementary school&#8212;the one from class E&#8212;a boy named Yamamoto&#8212;has been in love having been in a lot of trouble with the seniors at the club recently."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So simple," Toyota Ayaka smiled, "but I get it"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"You understand?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I really understand"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"In freshman year&#8212;I'll be recognized by my seniors&#8212;I always felt like I knew everything. Yes - I really had nothing recently. I was too dry. I died a woman."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hey - that's funny. Natsuki, have you withered yet?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Withered - already aunt Ah &#8212;&#8212;. My life seems to be in a dark place. I just transferred to a new class, who knows there aren't many handsome men&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I understand this too&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Of course, let's fall in love. Teshima, how about you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hah!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Miyuu Teshima, second year A, student number 22, dropped a tomato that was still pale.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"A story about me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Um, about you. Can you talk about it? Love"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;W-W-Ah, it hurts!!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Teshima frantically thought about putting the tomatoes in the bowl, and her hand hit the faucet.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Teshima you&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">said Natsuki, who was dumbfounded.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;You always hit it. It's like introducing yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah&#8212;yes, that's right. During the first class meeting.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Yeah, I hit it. I am standing. When, on the table "bang"."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Given that. Teshima Miyuu blushed and lowered her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Early May after Golden Week. The fourth class is cooking practice.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The sophomore Class A students who wore white clothes and triangular shawls were urged to cook dishes they were not familiar with. In early summer, the blue sky suddenly brightened. Even though today was a day when the mood was high even in silence, Miyuu's mood was on the decline.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The reason lies in the group members.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">There were four people in Miyuu's group according to student numbers. Tsubakiya Hinata plus Segawa Natsuki and Toyota Ayaka. In class, no, even among all the students in junior high school, they were two attractive girls. No matter who has dyed their hair to the point where they can barely be caught and directed, curling irons come in handy too. Even though the lipstick was applied after school, her eyebrows were neatly drawn and her eye makeup was perfect. They were the kind of people who would roll up their skirts and run out into the street as soon as school was over.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Teshima - your hand stopped-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah, okay, I'm sorry!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Natsuki said, Teshima quickened the pace of boiling the tomatoes. While the group's progress was generally smooth, Miyuu, who was in charge of the salad, often held back. Even though she wasn't being bullied, she didn't want to be noticed by the two attractive girls, so she passed the day as calmly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So, Tsubakiya, how about you&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Natsuki, who was still stirring the eggs, took aim at Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Huh, me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata from grade 2, a girl from grade two A, blinked as she tasted the sauce.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Yeah - I don't really understand - this kind of thing"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I don't know - no way, depending on how you look. Isn't it easy to eat between boys?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Even if you say so--"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mmmmm</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Hinata licked the sauce with her finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Even this casual movement is like a painting. Even though it had been more than a month since the entrance ceremony, Miyuu was still not used to Tsubakiya Hinata's presence.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I'm just a kid, and I still don't quite understand it."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Putting that aside, don't you have someone you like? A man who thinks he's a little handsome. It's fine even if he isn't handsome. Before you knew it, your eyes fell on that man. Something like that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hmm-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Lick.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah, this fellow is still licking the sauce. If you taste it and continue like this, you will eat it all?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;No&#8212;&#8212;too nice to notice. The use of oranges in the sauce is quite good. Ah, after all, this recipe is actually quite trendy. Why don't you try it at home?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So what? Who's your favourite?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Um-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata looked up at the ceiling, then licked the sauce again without thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;...Although this is only Miyuu's personal opinion, the strong are always calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">If she turned into Tsubakiya Hinata, she would quickly lose someone's name, or just cower in fear and cry. Although casual, Segawa Natsuki's method of asking had a hint of questioning in it. If someone in the upper class was questioned in this way, it might be impossible to maintain such a calm demeanor, in general.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">But Tsubakiya Hinata is not ordinary. Height, appearance, and behavior are all based on solid theory. So she was indifferent, even at this time, she was still tasting the sauce. If Miyuu did the same, she would be kicked for saying "Listen to someone".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Muranaka-sensei or what?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah&#8212;Muranaka.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Hinata suggested the name of a teacher who was said to be handsome, and Natsuki nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Muranaka-sensei, it's not that he doesn't understand. Is that so, Muranaka-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Half accept, half don't.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;But that doesn't matter&#8212;there are other people too, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Wait, Natsuki,"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Interrupted Toyota Ayaka here.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Don't you find that annoying? Is that a little too deep to ask?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh-? Is that so--?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Continue? By the way, how long do you want to stir this egg? If you keep stirring it will foam up, but it's not cake."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh-hh"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki, who complained, and put away.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">(...?)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">For some reason Miyuu felt a strange atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The former are generally the Energetic type, while the latter are generally the Cool type.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After entering middle school, they were in the same class. After that, the two people who made up this eye-catching group shouldn't have much contact with Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Because the number of students each person is close together, and the cooking practice classes are very few. Taking this opportunity to speak to a big influencer at school - it's understandable to think so. A little faster (very slightly), Miyuu, who had developed a good relationship with her, wanted to do the same if possible. LINE has been exchanged, and books have been borrowed from each other, but nothing but a few non-essential conversations.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">(But it always feels like this&#8212;)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">I can't say exactly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I can't say it exactly, I feel a strange atmosphere. Segawa Natsuki kept asking questions for some reason, and Ayaka Toyota felt that she wanted to stop her for this reason.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">That is, the "love, love" cooking is done, and everyone is tasting the food they made.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">During this period of cooking practice when class harmony is considered, lunch service is cancelled, and students only eat their own dishes for lunch. For most students, it was an unfamiliar dish, failure would occur in various places, and this failure alone had made the atmosphere in various places tense.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">That said, there are many other topics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But despite this, Segawa Natsuki gave up the old account.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though Tsubakiya said something like, 'It's fine in Muranaka&#8212;"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She said, holding the tomato in the vegetable salad between her chopsticks.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about the others? Teshima"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ha!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"You&#8212;&#8212;? Are there other candidates&#8212;&#8212;? A good-looking candidate or something."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Only"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if you say so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Teshima swallowed the cucumber and was speechless.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As a lower class person at the base of the pyramid, if the answer was wrong, even death was possible. You can't answer casually.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Teshima thought about it for about three seconds and answered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;Eto, Onodera-sensei?&#8221;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Homeroom teacher of second grade A, 24 years old.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The youngest teacher at Mominoki Private Academy. He wasn't short, he wasn't fat, he wasn't bald, and he didn't smell weird. Even though he was too young and perhaps lacking in dignity, he could also hear his calm and steady teaching style from the guardian.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For the sake of security, there will be no reproach, and there will be no biased choices in the first place.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Onodera Tatsuya"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki "Ah&#8212;" tugged at the salad with a fork,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well&#8212;this&#8212;isn't that incomprehensible&#8212;. Onodera?&#8212;Ono Ah&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 150%;"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Although it wasn't that she couldn't understand what she was saying, she seemed to want to say that she couldn't understand. Miyuu was restless and her heart was racing, did she answer the wrong answer, or would she be kicked under the table?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Also&#8212;good, Ono Tatsuya"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">said Toyota Ayaka with help.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"It's also very popular, our homeroom teacher. By the way, we don't have many young teachers in this school."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I think"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"He is fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey, Teshima, are you in love with Onodera-sensei?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ha!? It is not like that! Segawa-san, what are you talking about!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hmph&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki seemed to have lost interest in Miyuu, who hastily denied it, and stuffed the already messy salad into her mouth. If you're not interested, don't bring up such a sensitive topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So, Tsubakiya, you."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka seems to be getting excited again.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Your house and Ono Tatsuya's house are very close, right? I heard it from someone&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"He lives next door to me, in the apartment"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wow, really? How does that feel? Don't you think that's really annoying? The homeroom teacher lives next door or something.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Even though he used to be the eldest brother next door, he became a teacher at his own school. It was over a year ago. Even if he becomes the homeroom teacher, it doesn't matter now."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;"Even so. Do you think that's annoying?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Very&#8212;annoying. Always being bullied by her&#8212;at school, she doesn't say anything to me, and she complains to me when she sees her outside of school. Really. The thing is&#8212;let me go&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;I always felt I could understand that."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Is that true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya, don't you like her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki asked again "Ono Tatsuya"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ahaha no no"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata waved the spoon in refusal.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Let's just say&#8212;if the teacher came to see me, he would have known me since before I was born. Doesn't he treat me as such a woman? I don't think I can either. I knew that before. I was born, and if the boy is younger than me, it's hard to see the child as a target for love."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah... well, that might be-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"And you see, childhood sweethearts or something. In fact, the chances of getting together are very low, even if this is seen on the Internet or somewhere."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8212;&#8212;Is that so</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The topic of very high love. If you talk about this topic while eating, you will suddenly feel beautiful. The leading characters in the class, led by Tsubakiya Hinata, gathered. Naturally, the scenery in the cooking practice room also blended in.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Miyuu was unable to participate. Just don't disturb the atmosphere and just echo two sentences. A girl who only wants to enjoy novels and manga because she doesn't love herself, acts so as not to annoy them as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"What the hell-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Even at such a time, the strong would change the atmosphere without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Takayama-senpai, how-what?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki brought up a new topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">This is a new topic with a strong sense of rudeness.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Takayama-senpai. I'm talking about Takayama Kaito, a third year student at the athletics club. It was a huge celebrity that even Miyuu knew. As the whiz of the athletic club, he often attends urban conferences, he is also very good at studying and has a slim figure, which is very popular among girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The more the topic of love becomes a topic, the more suitable candidates will be placed in the center of the topic. But still, there are questions. Isn't there a big person besides Takayama-senpai?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Natsuki"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka glared at Sekawa Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The atmosphere is understandable. But even so, I've always felt that the method of bringing up the topic was a bit too forced. Been feeling this way since my cooking practice.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Even though Segawa Natsuki was stunned, she continued to speak without a care.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya, what do you think&#8212;. About Takayama-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh&#8212;? Uh&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Do you know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Yes. How about Toyota-san?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"He's a pretty good person, right? I didn't say I like Takayama-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hmm"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So how about it? How about you, Tsubakiya?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I don't like it either."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata took the spoon, tucked into the remaining egg roll, so to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Sorry, but I don't know much about love. I can tell if this person is handsome or not, but when it comes to dating, I can't imagine it. So I don't know much about him. Takayama-senpai. Besides, I don't know anyone with good."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><span style="line-height: 150%;"></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hmph&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki mumbled, and stuffed the egg roll into her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">By the way, Toyota Ayaka seems to be secretly watching.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Such a Toyota Ayaka was fiddling with a vegetable salad. I don't know how many times the cucumber was pierced with a fork, and it was full of holes. She was confused &#8212; no, rather focused. She didn't seem too interested, but she strained her ears and listened.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">(...?)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The atmosphere is very strange, I don't know why.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki, who had an unreasonable attitude, and Toyota Ayaka who always looked a little strange. Are you nervous about&#8212;&#8212; talking to Tsubakiya Hinata?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">No, no, no.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Miyuu shook her head. They themselves are not the bottom group, how is that possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"What about Tsubakiya?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki repeated again.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I don't have a son that everyone likes, and I don't know Takayama-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">She finally stuffed the crushed cucumber into her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Isn't it useless? Tsubakiya, you are so beautiful.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Uh, hey. Hey, am I pretty? Really pretty?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Beautiful. Honestly, it's amazing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;I never wear makeup properly, so why is it shining like this? Is this embarrassing for me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8212;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then you should work hard for now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"What do you mean by hard work?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Well, first eat more and exercise properly."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Just that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"And go to bed early. Around 12 at night"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"It's not early at all&#8212;it's a bit late. What about hair care? What shampoo do you use?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh? It's just casually using what's in the house."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;You haven't worked hard yet. Damn, it's because of such natural beauty&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Not like that-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">It turned into a normal girl chat.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&#8220;What kind of shampoo do you have in the house?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka also joined in the chat, and the atmosphere suddenly became harmonious.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Miyuu breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">I finally came out of the tense state of never knowing the way. And Miyuu also wanted to know what shampoo Tsubakiya Hinata was using.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah, so&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki changed the subject.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya, do you have a cell phone?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I brought it&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Can you add LINE friends later?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Okay-"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah, then me too"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Toyota Ayaka naturally joined, Finally became happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">(As expected of people from the upper group...)</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Miyuu who was half admired and half envious.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">So smooth. And then there's the enviable display of "a junior high school girl should be like this". She was obviously the same age, and she was also an elementary school student a few years ago. What did she do to make a big change in the course of her life?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Even if it was jealousy or something too out of proportion (and Miyuu wasn't trying to "should be"), but still, it couldn't stop her from dazzling. If possible, Miyuu wanted to live like that, or grow up. Not to mention Tsubakiya Hinata, Segawa Natsuki, and Toyota Ayaka&#8212;no, it must be rude to say that. Those two wouldn't be "doing nothing", right?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Teshima"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">While thinking about such things, suddenly someone called out.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ha!? What's wrong? Would you like another bowl of salad?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"No&#8212;ah. You can also add LINE. Wait a minute"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Uh, uh"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh what&#8212;ah, don't you want to add it? We're in the same group"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, that's for sure. I think so!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Let's start groups later. But&#8212;aren't these egg rolls really good? I think they really are masterpieces."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">That's what happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Segawa Natsuki seemed to care about Miyuu subconsciously. When Miyuu was about to be left behind, Segawa Natsuki helped her in her own way. In fact, she might be unexpectedly a good person. Then this kind of place might also be because of the angle of the sun.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">... in the middle.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">It seemed like a lot had happened, but the cooking practice time, which didn't seem any different from usual, ended without incident&#8212;&#8212;, from the point of view of a girl named Miyuu Teshima.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Although her brain was definitely not stupid, her observation skills weren't that great. What was happening right now became a spark, and she was unaware of the fact that one day it would burn.</span></p>
