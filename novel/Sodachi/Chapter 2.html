<h3>Chapter 2</b></h3>(Wow, it really is Tsubakiya Hinata.)</span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Junior High School - Mominoki Private Academy, second grade A.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is spring weather. The opening ceremony ends at 11.00. In a new class with new friends, the first homeroom period is held. Of course, there is no shortage of time for students to introduce themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;I was in class C in my freshman year. I didn't join any club. I don't have any particular interests, but I quite like reading."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(It's really cool if you look closely.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While looking up to enjoy the self-introduction of her age friend sitting next to her, Teshima Miyuu secretly admired her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(What is this... Is it a foreigner? Or an alien?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tall body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Smooth face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Long eyelashes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">White, slender hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everywhere I looked, I saw things far beyond ordinary people's standards.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it's not confirmed yet, but if approached, I'm sure this person will give off a nice scent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;There were a few friends I studied with last year, but there may be many more who will become new classmates. So in the coming year, we look forward to your help.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The self-introduction is complete.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just a brief self-introduction, nothing special. But I don't understand why the atmosphere in the classroom is so stuffy and indescribable. Suddenly the atmosphere became tense. The classmates turned to look at each other, even the sound of gulping could be heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Have I ever met an atmosphere like this in my life?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course not. Today must be the first time. An existence with a completely different character appeared right before everyone's eyes, which everyone secretly acknowledged. Just like moon and rice cakes, there were things that were similar in shape, but there was no point in comparing them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The thing is, Miyuu's last name is Teshima.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata and Teshima Miyuu. In the first period of the school year, students will usually be seated in alphabetical order.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;So, the next student after Tsubakiya is&#8230; Teshima.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The homeroom teacher Onodera Tatsuya pointed at Miyuu's name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Please introduce yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's right, the one who introduced herself next was the little girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hastily getting up from the chair caused her knees to get caught on the side of the table making an annoying shrill sound. Of course everyone in the class would hear it eventually.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It looks like it's the end, but it doesn't stop there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason was simply because she&nbsp;and the student sitting next to her- Tsubakiya Hinata made eye contact.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, she&nbsp;suddenly thought of Medusa's story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Anyone who makes eye contact with Medusa will end up petrified, that's what happened between Tsubakiya Hinata and Teshima Miyuu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Like a silent predator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not like a tiger or a lion, if you have to compare it, it's more like a leopard. Smooth and agile, agile carnivores at the top of the ecosystem's food chain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, Hinata had no intention of devouring Miyuu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was just watching, perhaps showing concern when she&nbsp;saw Miyuu's legs tangled in the table. But unfortunately at the wrong time, for a person who was shy and also under invisible pressure like the current Miyuu, it was like a nightmare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;He-hello I amm-&#8230;!!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tongue bitten.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Taking her first steps in her sophomore year of junior high school, she&nbsp;had already stumbled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Teshima Miyuu is an ordinary junior high school girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, she&nbsp;was slightly below average.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wearing glasses and braided hair, less than six feet tall, her&nbsp;stature is so short that she&nbsp;has a habit of crouching.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her voice is clear, she has difficulty making eye contact when she speaks, a small town girl who has only seen novels and comics as a reason to live.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was completely different from Tsubakiya Hinata in every way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not just the points that have been and can be counted, the differences come from their natural sources. Neither adding nor multiplying, the difference here has a completely different meaning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(This is so weird, aren't these two in the same class? Aren't they both sophomores?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although her heart calmed down somewhat, realizing the difference made Miyuu sigh. Of course, she&nbsp;didn't feel jealous or envious at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them just accidentally became classmates, accidentally placed a chair next to each other, that was all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just like in a botanical garden. Whether routinely or occasionally, having the opportunity to meet through a series of events, in essence humans and animals are two separate existences, without any disturbance of similarity in nature. Considering the current situation, of course Miyuu would represent the beast side. Not only animals but also rare animals. When compared to Tsubakiya Hinata, Miyuu's existence was like a little guinea pig, it was underrated. Worse, she&nbsp;looked like plankton, so small that no one could see it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(In the near future, I must not attract attention, must not attract attention...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the first place, Miyuu's whereabouts were very vague, but if something caught her eye, of course people would notice it. If you can, hold your breath, preferably, hold your breath, then just stand there and wait for the time to pass. She&nbsp;was already stiff with just eye contact, if people stared at her&nbsp;for too long she&nbsp;would turn to stone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...This was an obvious thing to happen, never expected anything unexpected to appear right after.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next day, the opening ceremony was held.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A day had passed, and it was a bit of time to maintain the lingering composure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, although it was clear that Tsubakiya Hinata was a separate existence from another dimension, the two were classmates and sat next to each other. The distance between the two girls' tables was only about ten centimeters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just before the national language class started.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata spoke up, her bag open in her hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She forgot her&nbsp;book, Miyuu realized silently. I just had bad luck on the first day of the year, so the bell is ringing now, even if I want to go to another class to borrow a book, I can't.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, Teshima-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata clasped her hands together,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"May I see the book?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eh~... Miyuu shouted silently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you sit next to me, of course this will happen. However, Miyuu was still not mentally prepared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before she&nbsp;could answer, the teacher entered the classroom. The whole class is serious. After chatting for a while, the national language class finally started. Not much time left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata pulled the table closer- "I'm really sorry!"- She clasped her hands together and smiled wryly. The shiny black hair fluttered, emitting a sweet fragrance. The smell is even better than I expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Class is starting. Um, what page is that... Class turns to page four and page five for me to see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">National language teacher Onodera Tatsuya. A young teacher who has only been in his profession for two years. Even Miyuu clearly noticed her youth while looking at her. Starting from business suits that still look foreign, to gestures and hand gestures when giving lectures.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Spring is the season for new meetings, as well as the beginning of the process of getting to know each other. The relationship between students is not said, for the teacher there is more or less something new and foreign. First of all, we should keep discipline to a minimum, avoid straying too far from common sense, and try to create an atmosphere of normalcy for those around us. Even the teachers are trying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So this guy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This person's name is Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the first day of school, I forgot to bring a book, I don't know if this person has nerves of steel or the type who doesn't care about the judgment of the people around her&nbsp;anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He glanced sideways.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though I knew Tsubakiya Hinata was tall, when sitting like this, for some reason there was still a difference in their eyesight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What caused it? Of course not because of the different seat heights, nor because Tsubakiya Hinata's legs were longer than Teshima Miyuu's. The answer is a state of shock. When she realized the difference in the nature of the two even though the others were only female friends of the same age, of course Miyuu would be psychologically affected more or less.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Eh&#8230; Natsume Sousaki. Do you know this person?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Onodera-sensei began his lecture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;About the work &#8220;I am a paint&#8221;, right in the first article in the textbook, you can see it as soon as you open it. Anyone who has read it will know that this is a very reader-friendly novel. This work is built primarily from a humorous style, so it is very accessible. By the way, this is the debut work of writer Natsume Sousaki, who is known&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu glanced to the side again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To her&nbsp;surprise, Tsubakiya Hinata listened intently to the lecture. She&nbsp;stared straight ahead, her&nbsp;clear eyes shining brightly, occasionally nodding to the teachings. Even the posture resting on the elbows on the table was very neat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu loosened up a bit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Hmm... Of course, it's beautiful.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first I was just going to peek, but now I don't know why, but now I'm staring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The elegant bridge of the nose, the glossy fresh lips, the colorful curls of hair in the sun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Beauty is different, beautiful in every nanometer of the cell.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Come to think of it, I was lucky, right?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Isn't the current situation too comfortable? Free to see beauty like this. It's like sitting in the front row of a big concert.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not to mention, if by any chance Tsubakiya Hinata forgot to bring a book like today, Miyuu would have good reason to see Hinata close enough that the two of them could feel each other's body temperature. Perhaps, only Hinata's family members were allowed to be near and observe her all this time. No, not even close relatives. It's only the first few days of my sophomore year of junior high school, but I'm already this lucky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unaware.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl made eye contact with Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">More than eye contact, she&nbsp;was being stared at by Hinata.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tB05H6d/12.jpg" alt="12" border="0"></a>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, it was Miyuu who looked at Hinata first. If one looked straight at the bottom of the abyss, naturally the bottom of the abyss would also look back. In this case, to be more precise, Miyuu was being watched by Medusa, from such a close distance that even family members rarely had a chance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Careless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu had turned to stone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Can't move, can't speak. Even though the veins in her&nbsp;body felt like they had stopped flowing, her&nbsp;face was red, and she&nbsp;wore a confused expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was only after her&nbsp;name was called that she&nbsp;regained consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Teshima&#8230;Teshima-san? Did you hear that?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a call from Onodera-sensei.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gathering her&nbsp;senses, she&nbsp;hastily replied with a "Y-yes" answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly standing up, she&nbsp;banged her&nbsp;foot against the table. Boom!- This skill cannot be mastered with practice. Just like that, giggles echoed here and there in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Teshima&#8230;&#8221;- The teacher remained unchanged- &#8220;Have you read &#8220;I Am a Cat&#8221;? If I'm not mistaken, you're in the art club, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Y-yes, yes! I've read the book!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you like Souseki?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes yes!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So how about I read the next paragraph?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Too bad for her&nbsp;to say that, her&nbsp;mind was in the clouds, so she&nbsp;didn't remember anything about the content of the lesson.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was even more panicked, tears welling up in her eyes. As expected, the first day of the second year of middle school was a complete nightmare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Page 7, line 10.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Whispering voice</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the side came a voice. It took her&nbsp;a few seconds to realize that it was Tsubakiya Hinata's voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once again, Tsubakiya Hinata whispered (line ten), her eyes still not leaving the book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hastily turning the book to the right page, keeping her&nbsp;posture, raising the volume to medium, she&nbsp;started reading the work "I am a cat"- "...Here, our family has the opportunity to meet people other than students. First person the one I met was a maid. This person is even ruder than any student I met before..." Fortunately, she&nbsp;regained her&nbsp;composure in time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As long as she&nbsp;regained her&nbsp;composure, she&nbsp;would again become a member of the art club with the national language as the subject, thus easily getting out of the current troubled situation. Even Sensei Onodera would probably forgive her&nbsp;for not paying attention to her&nbsp;lecture. Despite barely escaping, it was already like this on the first day, who knows what the future will hold...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Class has ended.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bell rang, the whole class stood up and saluted. The class returned to a state of chaos.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...Too boring...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu lay on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She went to school and was so anxious that even breathing made her&nbsp;work hard. Sometimes she&nbsp;even forgets that humans have to breathe to live.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Teshima-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Difficulty has been added to the substance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata started a conversation with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl turned to look at Miyuu, their table was still the same, still close to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for the textbook case, really thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;N-it's okay. I am not doing anything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wow, this is so bad, dammit. Of course, I forgot the book, and I still got Onodera-sensei's class straight away. The homeroom teacher? Do you believe that? This is really bad luck&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, um, well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What should I do?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's okay to talk. Saying "Yes, that's true" isn't hard to answer, but what if you did and were eaten alive? After all, the other party is also a carnivore?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The difficulties don't stop there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Oh, by the way&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Ouch!)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata was getting closer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Ehhhh!!!)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu screamed in her mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The pressure is on the people. A feeling of being overwhelmed by a greater existence flashed before my eyes. It's like standing in front of a magnificent building, like Gaudí's Sagrada Familia.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the sound is so good, when heard from this close distance, the quality is really on another level. Normal speaking was as good as singing, sounding like nightingales in a tropical river playing and chatting, Miyuu thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh well, what do you need in the end?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you have a phone?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nod nod.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Smartphones too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nod nod. Bought by my parents when I was 2 years old.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Then give me the LINE ID later. If you do it now, you will be scolded... Anyway, thanks again. You saved me this time. Should I treat you to something to thank later? Well, did you eat my lunch dessert? Looks like it's fruit jelly today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh no...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm not the type to eat a lot...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? Today's menu looks really good, this potato casserole, this fried fish, this white rice, there's coleslaw too." Is it right?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But I don't really like fried fish...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Really? The fried fish is really good&#8230; Ah, it's better this way. Let me eat some fried fish for you, take it in return.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh yes. Thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You helped me, skipped lunch and got scolded...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, Teshima-san is in the art club, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's right. Do you have something you need?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Is there a good book you can recommend to me? The books that are trending recently are doing just fine.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hmm, let's see...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">... Do you like reading things like poetry?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow! Sounds interesting! So there is a book or not? If you like it, I'd love to read it too! &#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh yes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So you know Rimbaud?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Rambo? That movie?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was a French poet named Arthur Rimbaud.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(TLN: Hinata here thinks that Teshima is talking about Rambo from the movie "First Blood", whereas Teshima is actually referring to the French poet Rimbaud. Both are pronounced 'rambo' in Japanese)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Wow, let me read it! I'm going to the toilet here! LINE stuff for after school! Remember, don't forget!" (Smiles...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Are you going to use that cuteness as a murder weapon? - Leaving behind a smile that would make everyone think the same, Tsubakiya Hinata quickly left the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu was left with a dumbfounded face, Tsubakiya Hinata's innocent and innocent smile lingered in her mind and didn't want to let go. That's right, Hinata burst out laughing. However, Miyuu did not understand the reason behind that smile. Ah, is Hinata trying to sell an expensive jar of unknown origin, or is she trying to persuade her to join a mysterious sect?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...Wow, she&nbsp;seems to have said something about LINE ID exchange, right?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I'm not mistaken, Hinata did say that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just before leaving the classroom, Hinata emphasized that point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hinata also promised to help eat the fried fish she hated. Not to mention asking her&nbsp;to recommend good books...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Wow, looks like the two of us are already friends...?)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Wow...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu jumped up and down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Subconsciously, her&nbsp;body moved on its own, forming a small dance. It was to the point that the surrounding classmates had to look back with shocked eyes. It made her&nbsp;blush, hastily sitting back in the chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This development was clearly unintentional.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the difference between the moon and plankton, she&nbsp;never thought that the two could become friends like this. If so, how about opening your heart a little more? A plankton to attract the attention of the moon is also a big blessing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Really a nice person...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu really became a fan of Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The process is so easy that it makes other people laugh. For a little girl who was taking a step towards adulthood, this was certainly a big event.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Such a wonderful person...)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Both the genetic code and the surrounding atmosphere were clearly different, to think that a girl who looked like she came out of a fairy tale, suddenly turned out to be this friendly. Of course Hinata's house is no less beautiful. Never miss something unsightly, never open a conversation, never mind things that don't concern you, that's for sure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Hinata wasn't an angel, she was just a middle school girl the same age as Miyuu. Of course Miyuu understood ideals and reality as two completely different things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, that girl, that girl named Tsubakiya Hinata...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Miyuu secretly hoped that she would still become an existence that far surpassed an ordinary person like herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was as if she had found a bright light, in the midst of a series of major events on the dark first day of the second year of junior high school, Miyuu thought to herself.</span></p>
