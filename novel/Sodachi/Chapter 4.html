<h3>font-size: large;"><b>Chapter 4</b></span></h3><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata definitely did.</span></span><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was a rumor that circulated in the early spring of last year. That is, not long after she entered the junior high school of the Miminoki Private Academy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He's an adult, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Someone said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Her breasts are very big. She looks like an older sister from a relative's house. In fact, it would be a lie to say that she didn't do anything. It's different from her body."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I saw her&nbsp;walking to the hotel."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Someone else said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is the life of a sugar daddy/papakatsu dad. It's like she&nbsp;went to a love hotel with someone. Not just doing it, but doing it all over again. I'm definitely doing the same thing as AV." (TLN: papakatsu = you earn money from men by dating only if you are not in a relationship)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, when and where did you see her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, I don't know. I heard from a friend from a friend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He dated three people at once when she&nbsp;was in elementary school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some people even say so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And one is a high school student, one is a student, and the other is an uncle who doesn't know where to go. It's true. It's really positive. Maybe it's, something, promiscuity or something? Good - 3P4P or something. Me too. I want to she&nbsp;did it with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it's just a rumour.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no proof. With ambiguous reasons, the new student was given a sexually positive impression. In a sense, there was no way to do this&#8212;&#8212; Takayama Kaito thought so. After all, Tsubakiya Hinata looks too mature. Then the junior high school students are full of energy all the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as I find the rumors and gossip, I will join the topic with all my strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Kaito, who had just entered his second year at the time, was different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata did that kind of thing over and over again, Kaito didn't think about it at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no proof. But there is evidence. But it's not the kind of ambiguous base that rumours, but a very close to evidence base.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Takayama Kaito is an athletics club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Focus on sprinting, obstacle course, speed jump, etc. Most of the activities are very good. Even though he wasn't bragging, Kaito was already the top candidate in his class. Even so, it was only a weak school that allowed participation in many projects.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That day, Kaito stayed at the school for additional training.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was in April, shortly after the opening ceremony.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it is classified as a weak school, it is still the main candidate, and its momentum is only entering the second grade. The word "training" doesn't sound bad either. After graduating from third grade, activities will become more free, so I might as well do something like this here and show actions that befit my senior image.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, it is the second year of this year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In club activities, first grade is at the bottom of the pyramid. Therefore, there are some who are finally able to get off the ground and have a bit of a high emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a few days, the athletics club will also have new first year students to join the club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is also for that time, the time for public performances.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Extra training to be able to take the posture of a senior. There is no other goal that is impure or pure than this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the afternoon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since they were training, naturally there were no other athletic and field members around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the activity room building in the distance, the playful slapstick of the members changing clothes could be heard. By the time the sun that dyed the sky a bright red was about to set in the west, there weren't many people in the field.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Next)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While doing flexibility exercises, Kaito set his sights on the bar that was 25 meters away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The pole was one hundred and seventy centimeters high. Slightly higher than the average record for the second year of junior high school, but it wasn't something to be proud of as a member of the athletic club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But as a player who participated in several events, this goal was enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the pinnacle of difficulty in the literal sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it's not really necessary to jump. For Kaito with excellent motor skills, he can achieve good results no matter what the challenge. In other words, universal types have few limitations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't feel that going beyond my own limits makes life meaningful, even if I don't jump to this height and succeed in life, it won't be too much trouble.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Well, after all, this is the second year.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For reasons that are not clear, Kaito has set a good goal that can be achieved one day with the right effort, although it is a bit difficult, it is still within reach.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Regulate the breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It ran as if it floated lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sense of distance is useful for high jump jumps. Count your steps and gradually raise your knees to the rhythm, neither too fast nor too slow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only in the last tenth of a second to accelerate violently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Imagine what a flying fish looks like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Create a soft crescent shape from shoulders to waist to back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The jump back is like a flowing liquid.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let's achieve the goal of becoming as tall as myself, beautifully and gracefully&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">bang dang</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;... I didn't make it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bar spun with illusions, and Kaito looked up at the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Three centimeters lower)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He estimated the distance to the target.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's it now. But he already knows how to succeed. The next question is whether to do it or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Anyway, let's do some muscle training first. Then we'll understand the angle and timing.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito stood up and prepared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Start, accelerate, jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(No. Wrong angle. Back bend isn't very smooth.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(But not impossible. Definitely can.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course this is not something that can be repeated many times without harm. Fatigue accumulates. And there is no guarantee that you will succeed if you do it dozens of times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What matters is the mindset. Athletics is a challenge in itself. Believing that you can do it, passing the road to do it nonchalantly, and there are no shortcuts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Imagine and imagine)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Desire to do it absolutely)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(If you keep thinking that you can't do it, you won't make any progress. Even if you lie to yourself, you have to believe that you can do it.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">All other athletic and field members have returned. On the field, Kaito continued training silently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Try again and again, keep failing. Lonely fight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I consider myself quite handsome. This arrogance is important. Although theory is also studied and sold from consultant teachers, and in the final analysis, it is only the school's main weak strength.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Alternately, but enough to concentrate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fascinated by this. just go ahead.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Kaito didn't notice. In the field where no one was present, there was a figure other than him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah&#8212;what a shame.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito heard this sentence after failing many times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito got up from the mat and turned his gaze towards the sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A female student was there. Even though she&nbsp;was wearing the Mominoki Academy school uniform, it was a face he&nbsp;had never seen before. Maybe a transfer student? Third grade? Or high school students?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, sorry to bother you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Not"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Should be older than him in Kaito's judgment. It was natural to use honorifics.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, observe and learn"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said the student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"May I see?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, no problem. Please."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you very much"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He crouched there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Friendly smile. Her appearance was clearly very mature but unbelievably childish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...Ah)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito finally realized it. The school uniform tie is light blue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is that a lie. Kaito widened his eyes. Light blue is the color of first graders this year. That is, she&nbsp;is a freshman. He couldn't help but utter the words "That's a lie". Growing up like this in first grade? And very funny.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't get in the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito who was a little shy, accidentally spoke harshly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm training for now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay&#8212;that won't get in the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Are you interested? Athletics."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm, a little."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then let's see. Don't get in the way, I'm serious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first grader raised her&nbsp;hand in response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not only a smile, but also a very friendly personality. And not shy. Obviously, she&nbsp;should have just entered school and shouldn't be used to it, but she&nbsp;still has this attitude in front of the seniors. Have you ever been belittled? Or he's just natural.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Compared to this training, training)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though today's extra training was enough, it was quite annoying to come back like this. I just don't want other people to think that I'm the kind of person who can't be trained by being supervised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Refresh yourself and stand in front of the starting line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Prepare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Get started. speed up. jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...I can't concentrate)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The jump height is clearly not enough. in bad condition.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Are you tired? It shouldn't.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito secretly glanced at the students who were watching.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The freshman suddenly became serious. She&nbsp;crouched there the whole time, watching this side closely. Glittering eyes stand out in the twilight of the setting sun. The level of concentration is like copying all the scenes in front of you into your mind. She didn't even notice that the part between her knees and her skirt could be seen as she squatted down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Cough cough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Challenge again after pretending to cough.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Ah&#8212;damn!)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito hit the mat twice with his fists.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The mood became very bad. Kaito, who thought he was quite capable of overcoming his nervousness, had completely crushed his pride. But only watched by new students will make the rhythm so chaotic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if the other party was just a slightly different girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Impossible)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito lost his confidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Forget it today)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe today is such a day. Kaito's experience taught him that there comes a time when everything will fail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey that new kid"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Training is over. You should go back too"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, are you done?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't you say that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, sorry, senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After brushing the hem of her skirt, she stood up. The girl said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"May I give it a try?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl pointed to the bar and the mat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Which is being practiced by senpai.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito was confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? Do you have experience? Have you practiced the high jump before?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito didn't say the words that came to his mind. What is this guy talking about? But since everyone came to observe and learn, it was only natural to be interested. But.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...By the way, he's very tall)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it was seen that she was a very tall girl, her height was still beyond Kaito's expectation. Taking a closer look, she&nbsp;was almost the same height as Kaito. Not only that, the slender legs are also very well proportioned. There was something fundamentally different about the girls in the same class. Is this person really a junior? There's no way a transfer student whose tie color is wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...you are free"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Couldn't find enough reason to refuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the end, Kaito answered bluntly. "Thank you very much," said the shy freshman as she&nbsp;started to stretch and stood in front of the starting line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you going to do it in your school uniform?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't bring a change of clothes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about shoes? Aren't you just regular sneakers?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It was just trial and error."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite her&nbsp;very friendly demeanor, she&nbsp;doesn't listen to other people at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do whatever you want. Kaito waved his hand casually. "Thank you&#8212;" The freshman with the corner of her&nbsp;mouth raised showing her&nbsp;white teeth. She&nbsp;was more like an elementary school student than a junior. And it looks more like a boy than a girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">New students stand at the starting line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, Kaito's mood was as if his heart suddenly tightened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(That's pretty cool)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's hard to explain, but for example, it's like a regional competition in athletics and the field. Players who can achieve good results will definitely emit some kind of aura, and this freshman has that kind of aura. For example, the look in the eyes when looking at the bar, the serenity or tension of a relaxing action,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hah.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The freshmen started quietly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Long and comfortable stride. It sure looks good. As Kaito thought so, the new student quickened her&nbsp;pace. Turns out she&nbsp;was paying close attention. The movements are very similar to what is seen during practice. More than similar, it could even be said that she&nbsp;was better...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The freshman accelerated violently. The setting sun had dyed all of her long hair red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh, that's fake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This person is the type who can jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've seen it many times before. These types of players have the kind of vibe they get when they play regional tournaments, or more advanced tournaments. It's like pulling everyone in the arena into a whirlpool, like pushing people from behind with an invisible hand. This guy showed a magical moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">New students are more accelerated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ideal time. The whole body contracts like a spring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Jump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(-Ah)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that time, Kaito felt that</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(it's a flying fish)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ideal crescent shape from shoulders back to toes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Forming an arc, it continued to rise until the end, and within a tenth of a second when it reached the sky, the newborn seemed to have become some kind of winged creature. Kaito's eyes were completely on the new student, and he subconsciously clenched his fists and swallowed saliva.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/D5NNSyc/16.jpg" alt="16" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the very short time seemed very slow, the limited time would eventually come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">bang</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of the bar falling to the ground. And a "Boom" sound as the body falls on the mat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(...Hehehe)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito's surprise was the opposite.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Freshmen don't jump. Obviously her posture was very beautiful and her jump was perfect, but she hit the bar with all her might. It's more like scratching than touching it. There was still twenty centimeters from the required height.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't feel sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it failed miserably.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oops."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The new student scratched her&nbsp;head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sitting on the mat, she&nbsp;smiled helplessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not working at all. I made you laugh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Yes. Failed"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, no, no, no.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito complained about what she&nbsp;said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It really didn't work. There is still a distance of 20 cm from the set height. But please wait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if it is 20 cm lower, it jumps to a height of 150 cm. It is also at the forefront among junior high school children. And a girl jumped out. A new student who was an elementary school student not too long ago. What is even more frightening is that this is the first time she&nbsp;is watching, jumping for the first time, and she&nbsp;is still wearing a school uniform.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Especially flying fish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ideal type in Kaito's imagination. Soft as a spring, it feels like you can jump no matter how high you are.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Ah, it's over this time! Sorry I have to go back!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As if to cover up her&nbsp;failure, the new disciple rushed back. It should not be all the fault of the sunset so that the face turns red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, Kaito was left alone there. At the alternation of day and night, with an expression as if he was confused by something, the boy who witnessed the little miracle stood alone for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Hey Kaito, do you think so too?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His mind suddenly returned to reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Third grade spring. After school. Athletic training.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Small talk during breaks. Topics spread in unthinkable directions and went high.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya Hinata. Something must have happened."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah" Kaito answered faintly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some third year boys from the athletics club. In the short time when the consultant teacher is not staring, it is perfect for chatting about interesting topics. Exactly the same rumor topic as last year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I heard it" said another member.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya Hinata is a single parent and has no father. Then, I heard that her mother works nights in Ginza. In this case, most of the girls too&#8212;&#8212;Isn't that the pattern?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There are some"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I understand."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">All members except Kaito agreed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The chatter was even higher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But that guy isn't dating anyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. I don't know that part. No wonder that 3P or something."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There should be more."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Indeed. There must be someone confessing secretly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you get rejected, you don't want to talk about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Usually you hide it from other people.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way I really want to do it. That guy is really interesting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. If she&nbsp;can get into the athletics club, she&nbsp;can become the subject of everyday imagination."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Must be doing something."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you doing?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The topic keeps turning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Junior high school boys are indeed difficult to get rid of in various aspects. They are only interested in one thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not to mention Tsubakiya Hinata. The feelings I had when I first entered school have become more mature lately. Because of this, the popularity among boys is also getting higher and higher.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, what about Kaito?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The topic was brought back to Kaito.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you think? Tsubakiya Hinata definitely did."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now that he is in third grade, Kaito has become the president of the athletics club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Has a pretty big sound. By the way, it also has quite a lot of power. After concentrating on the high jump last year, his performance improved significantly. Now he can jump up to 1.8 meters, and he is always ahead of the competition. If you consider that he is a player from a weak school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How does he feel about Tsubakiya Hinata?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The other members would naturally care a lot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He didn't,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito confirmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The other members showed "Huh?" expressions. Surprised by this answer. I think if I went to Kaito about this topic, I would agree.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? What? Hah?" whispered the members.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tsubakiya Hinata. Is that true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Does Kaito know something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is your relationship with Tsubakiya Hinata?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No problem&#8212;" Kaito replied. "But I know. That guy didn't do it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;There are some grounds for that. You must know something."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tell me now. Don't hide anything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naturally, Kaito was questioned further.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito replied as if he was annoyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Jump View"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito looked into the distance as if he had stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The way she&nbsp;jumps is beautiful."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A staff member frowned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, what 'beautiful'. What are you trying to be cool about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about. I don't understand at all&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You must be hiding something else."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Annoying&#8212;ah"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito pushed away the members who had rushed over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;Training continues. Master is back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? Is that true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito was standing alone at the high jump starting line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tsubakiya Hinata doesn't join the athletics club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito didn't tell anyone what he saw at sunset that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Kaito was probably the only one who knew when she&nbsp;became a flying fish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito focused his gaze on the 1.85 meter high bar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once your body is relaxed, take a breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It ran as if it floated lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito knows at least three boys that Hinata Tsubakiya rejected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The third person was Kaito himself. A few days ago. I haven't talked about it with anyone, and the confessional process hasn't been seen by anyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah... I don't know much about love..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Tsubakiya Hinata said bluntly</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rejected, but she still remembers Kaito. &#8220;You were a senior at that time, weren't you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he was rejected, he was somehow proud of the fact that she still remembered himself. I knew it wouldn't work, but I tried it anyway. But since this is a confession to end the lump in my heart, I don't regret it. Although it is true that there are still many regrets, Kaito feels that he has not become a man who can match Tsubakiya Hinata.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let's confess again after jumping to 1.9 meters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Kaito becomes obsessed with training after setting his goals carelessly. My stature is also slightly taller than last year, so there must be a possibility. Nothing has been decided yet. Everyone is still in high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Imagine what a flying fish looks like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Create a soft crescent shape from shoulders to waist to back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The jump back is like a flowing liquid.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That day, what Kaito saw must have been a real flying fish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From now on, the ghost would probably only remain in his memory.</span></p>
