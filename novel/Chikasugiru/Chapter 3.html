<h2 class="calibre5">Chapter 3 - Their Encounter</h2><span><a name="more" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre"></a></span>


<p class="calibre6">The next day after club activities, I headed to the bicycle parking lot and found Yuriko and Tachibana there. It seemed that the two of them were standing around talking, looking toward the field.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, Kenichi. Are you free now?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who was wearing a short-sleeved school uniform and had a school bag slung over her shoulder, said to me as I was about to walk past them. Tachibana was carrying a backpack with the straps stretched out, and her hair, which had been tied up in two during club activities, was down. When her eyes met mine, she smiled and made a small bow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Akari asked me if I wanted to stop by a family restaurant in front of the station on my way home. Oh, Nagai. Nagai, come here for a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko did not wait for my answer but called out to Nagai, who was walking with an enamel bag slung over his shoulder and his hands shoved into his pants and beckoned him over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai looked up, approached us, and asked Yuriko, "What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why don't we stop by the station together? Kenichi's coming too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What kind of gathering is this?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked at the three of us and asked suspiciously. Leaving aside if it was just me and Yuriko, but the three of us, including Tachibana, rarely hang out together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nothing in particular. I just felt like it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko answered with a smile as she folded her arms under her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Um. I'm on dinner duty..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I stood next to Yuriko and started to say this, she quickly moved her face to my ear. The sudden whisper tickled my ear and gave me goosebumps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's okay if it's just for a while, right? I don't mind if you leave halfway through. Just help me invite Nagai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I guessed from Yuriko's words that she was asked by Tachibana to invite Nagai to play together with her. I was either bait to catch Nagai or camouflage to appear natural.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">The station is the opposite of the way home, so it's a hassle. When I was mumbling, Yuriko gave a small, frustrated click of her tongue, and quickly pulled her face away from mine.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Somehow, I feel like I want to say something to myself."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said, looking into the distance and trying to sound heard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, stop it, you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said hurriedly, and Tachibana asked Yuriko happily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-senpai, do you have some kind of a weakness for Sakamoto-senpai?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Fufufu," Yuriko laughed unnaturally as she looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Please tell me too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What should I do. It depends on my mood whether my soliloquy will come out of my mouth or not..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Alright, I'll go.......Nagai, come with me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I pondered, pushed Nagai's back with my palm, and walked away from the two girls. Nagai looked back at Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What the h*ll do you have on Sakamoto?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Fufu, Yuriko said, tilting her head slightly, with a nonchalant expression on her face. ---I knew I should have hidden Izumi from her at the time.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and I were pushing our bicycles as the four of us walked toward the station nearest our high school. Dark brown clouds were floating in the dark sky, and an old street lamp on the edge of the road was casting a slightly yellowish light.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai and Tachibana were walking ahead of me, side by side, while Yuriko and I, pushing our bicycles, were walking a bit away from them. As we looked at Nagai and Tachibana, who were two heads apart, Yuriko asked, "Are you cooking the dinner?" Yuriko asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, I am."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? I didn't expect that. Do your relative who has moved in help you too?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi is in charge of breakfast. But when she has time, she also helps with dinner."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko mumbled as she looked ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The road from the high school to the station was quiet with only a few students from the same school walking along. I could hear the sound of the bicycle chain we were pushing and Nagai and Tachibana talking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After walking for about ten minutes, we arrived at a family restaurant on the street in front of the station. We entered the restaurant and sat down at a table for four, separated into men and women.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Perhaps because it was a weekday, the restaurant was not so crowded. In the non-smoking section, there were lone customers operating laptops and tablets, young men who seemed to have come to chat, and a group of girls wearing different high school uniforms.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and Tachibana chose a parfait and drink bar, while Nagai and I ordered French fries and a drink bar. After we finished ordering, Yuriko got up from her seat and said, "I'll go get you your drinks." Tachibana tried to follow her, but she said, "It's fine," and went off by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana and Nagai were somehow having a warm conversation that was typical of high school students. I decided to read the news on my phone so as not to disturb them. I ignored the conversation that came into my ears and followed the words on my phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the news site I connected to, there was news of a scandal at a major company, with pictures of men with their heads bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nagai-senpai, you are very popular among first-year girls, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's just flattery, right."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not flattery. You're in the top three in the soccer club."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at a column about the health benefits of a soy-based diet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is there such a ranking..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"To be more precise, Mori-senpai is in the first place, and Nagai-senpai is in second."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori is number one?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes. She can lead the boys even though she is a girl, it's dignified and cool."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Japan Meteorological Agency announced that this year's rainy season has been rainy throughout the country and that there seems to be no concern about water shortages.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee. How about Sakamoto?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was about to touch an article about this summer's featured movie, my name came up and my attention turned to Nagai's conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sakamoto-senpai is..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana turned her mischievous, cat-like eyes on me. I looked up from my phone and said shortly, "You don't have to tell me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah...," Tachibana smiled with a bitter smile and then continued.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"To be honest, Sakamoto-senpai's popularity is not so great, but some people thought he was dating Mori-senpai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You often go home with her. Because of that, I've been asked several times who is with Mori-senpai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's a misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I said this, Nagai continued to ask questions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But you guys really don't have that kind of relationship?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, absolutely not."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I answered immediately. When we first joined the club, the club members had many ill feelings toward us because we called each other by our first names, and some of the senior members looked at me with annoyed eyes. There were times when I worried about it, but after half a year, they understood that our relationship was a natural progression. Nagai must have known that we were not in that kind of relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At that moment, Yuriko returned, saying, "Sorry to keep you waiting," and put four glasses on the table. The conversation flowed on, and I sat down on the sofa with a deep sigh of relief and sipped the glass of Coke that Yuriko had brought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The drink was already in my mouth when I noticed that I smelled something strange.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was something mixed in the cola, and slowly, over time, the surface of my tongue began to heat up. I almost coughed at the smell, which was so pungent that it stung the back of my ears, and I hastily swallowed the liquid in my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko, you put Tabasco or something in there, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Did it not suit your taste?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I could see Yuriko unnaturally putting her hand over her mouth in an elegant gesture in my tear-stained vision as if to say, "Oh my," she said nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Seriously, stop doing that!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, drinking the water Nagai handed me with a laugh. D*mn, the cold water is making my tongue numb.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I was just trying to make it taste good. I mean, in another way."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's not good! No matter how you think about it, tabasco in cola is definitely wrong."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"it's delicious, Sakamoto-senpai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana interrupted from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, it's not!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said to Tachibana, "It's delicious, isn't it?" and the two of them said to each other, "that's right~". What a suffocating reaction. I'm starting to feel like I'm being bullied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai said, impressed, "Only Mori can mess with Sakamoto this much."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sakamoto-senpai is saved by Mori-senpai. Characteristically."</p>
<p class="calibre6">For some reason, Tachibana, too, had a satisfied look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">"What do you mean by that? I mean, Yuriko, do something about this. I don't want to drink anymore. My throat hurts."</p>
<p class="calibre6">It seemed that I had poured down a surprisingly large amount of the Tabasco cola, although the amount of cola with Tabasco was reduced, there was still about half a cup left to go.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said, "It can't be helped," and Yuriko took a moment to prepare herself, then gulped down the Tabasco cola in one gulp.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, "It tastes like s*it, right," and Yuriko sucked in her breath and smiled, "I guess it's not that bad," But her hands were shaking. She immediately started drinking water, though she kept her expression relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll drink it too, senpai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana, whether she read the atmosphere or something, gulped down the rest of the drink. There was no time to stop her. She placed the glass, rather carefully, on the table amidst the attention of the other three.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...................................................................."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, it's getting quiet. Is she all right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai asked Yuriko. Yuriko, looking at Tachibana with her mouth half-open as if to say, "I did it,". She was bent down, and from the front, I couldn't see her expression because it was hidden by her bangs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was a little worried and asked her, "Hey, are you sure you're okay?", Yuriko also asked, "Akari? Are you okay?". Eventually, Tachibana raised her face and nodded with her lips tied. Then, after a few more seconds, she opened her mouth, breathed in, and said with a red face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sakamoto-senpai is exaggerating, isn't he~"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're not convincing at all!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko laughed when I retorted reflexively. Tachibana, perhaps having reached the limit of her endurance, seized the melon soda with teary eyes.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">We talked for about an hour and then left the family restaurant. Yuriko and I got on our bicycles and Nagai and Tachibana walked toward the station. It was already dark, and the road along the national highway was filled with streetlights.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Does Tachibana like Nagai?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I cycled along, I asked Yuriko beside me. I had never talked about this topic with anyone before, though I had suspected it might be so for some time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I guess he's in the position of a senior she's interested in."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She's not serious enough yet, so that's about it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I don't know whether I understand it or not. I was too lazy to ask for more details and I wasn't interested in Tachibana's love life, so I let the conversation slide.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We drove as usual for about 20 minutes. Cars drove noisily, and our shadows, bathed in numerous streetlights, swayed unsteadily, like algae drifting in the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I parted from Yuriko on my way home, and when I arrived home, the light was on at the front door. Izumi's brown loafers were also placed there, neatly aligned. The light was also leaking from the living room door. When I entered, I found Izumi sitting in the dining chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Welcome home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, I'm home..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was still in her school uniform. It was just the time when Izumi was coming home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. I had to go out with a friend today and I'm running late."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I put my bag down on the floor and apologized.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, It's okay..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"For dinner, I think we could rely on pizza, but is that okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm fine. But is aunty okay with it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I've been ordering it from time to time when I don't have time to cook dinner. But there is a limit of three deliveries a month."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, wait a minute. I think there is a..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi flipped through the pamphlet that had been set aside on the side of the table and pulled out one, saying, "There it is."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"A discount pamphlet."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ooh. As expected."</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a discount coupon for ten percent off several kinds of pizzas.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We decided on the discounted Margherita and texted my mother, "Can we have pizza for dinner?". She immediately responded with a short "OK,". So we decided to order a large portion for three and a salad and made the call.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A few minutes passed while Izumi and I took turns taking showers and changing into loungewear. Just as I got out of the bath, changed into shorts and a T-shirt, and entered the living room, the intercom rang.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes," Izumi got up and headed for the front door, wearing a gray hoodie over her loungewear, even though no one outside could hear her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The sound of Izumi's exchange with the overly friendly delivery man could be heard all the way to the living room. When Izumi returned, she put a large flat box on the table and opened it. Seeing a small bag of Tabasco inside, I remembered Yuriko's prank.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Geez. Tabasco..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You don't like it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I rather like it when it's used appropriately."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Appropriately?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I've been around people who use it inappropriately..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi tilted her head. When I said, "Sorry, it was nothing," Izumi gave a small smile, took off her hoodie, and pulled out a knife. First, she cut it into a Y shape and then further divided it into two equal pieces. The cheese on the knife dripped thickly and clouded the surface of the stainless steel knife.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No problem."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at the TV, which had been left on, and saw that a movie was playing. It had just started, and I knew the movie.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, this movie."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My brother was raving about it the other day. I think he even posted a review of it on some website."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat down on the sofa with a plate of pizza. As I was watching the movie, I noticed that Izumi was also looking at the TV with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Isn't it hard to see there? You can sit on the sofa."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, but it's not good manners..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's okay, don't worry about it too much. You must be tired if you have to be so careful at home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Izumi said, "Then," with a smile on her face, and moved from the table to the sofa with her plate. Even though I was the one who said it, my concentration on watching the movie was taken away by my concern for Izumi sitting beside me. She had her hair, tucked around her chest. Her arms were terribly slender, extending out from the rather short sleeves of her short-sleeved T-shirt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">From the way she was staring at the screen, she didn't seem to be as nervous as I felt. This made me feel relieved, but also somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">On Saturday morning, exactly one week after Izumi's move-in day, I woke up to the sound of the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I got up from bed, the sun was already high in the sky and the room was bright with sharp rays of sunlight coming through the gap between the curtains. It was very hot. My body was slightly sweaty, and sweat trickled down from my sideburns to my neck.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at the clock on my bedside table and saw that it was past eleven o'clock.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had slept well last night, not waking up until this time, probably because I had stayed up late reading a book and fell asleep late, and also because I was tired from the week's work.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I stretched out my upper body on the bed. My thighs, calves, and abs were mildly sore. I yawned and exhaled thinly in a daze when there was a knock at the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In a daze, I replied in a sleepy voice and heard Izumi's voice through the door, "Kenichi-kun, aunty says you have to get up now."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"... Okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I put my slippers that I had taken off under the bed and opened the door to my room, with the bed hair on my head. And there was Izumi with a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was wearing a sleeveless blue shirt, brown shorts, and red slippers on her bare feet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Cleaning your room?</p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked, my head still a little fuzzy, and Izumi nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I was cleaning my room and around the stairs."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even when I stood up, my drowsiness didn't go away and I started yawning. I stretched my shoulders and noticed Izumi staring blankly into my room, which I had left open.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I questioned her, she reacted with a jolt, as if she had come to her senses.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry! I just thought it was a big bookshelf."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the door to my room wide and looked at the bookshelves that filled one wall. I casually asked, "Do you want to take a look?" Izumi said, "Is it okay?" Izumi said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded, and Izumi put the vacuum cleaner down in the hallway and walked into my room, saying in a low voice, "Excuse me...". The room was tidy enough that I was not embarrassed to be seen, but the blanket on the bed was crumpled, and that was the only thing that bothered me a little. Come to think of it, this is the first time Izumi has entered my room. Suddenly I became aware of it and left the door open. Somehow, it seemed easier than being alone in a closed room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi stood in front of the bookshelf and looked at the books lined up in a row.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's a huge amount of books."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Most of them were taken by my brother. But there were still many of them, so I kept them in this room. Some of them were precious books.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said as I pulled out one of Michel Foucault's books, which was placed within easy reach. When I flipped it open, I couldn't tell whether it belonged to my father or my brother, but there were Japanese characters and notes scribbled in a messy script.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Whose book is that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi asked with a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"A philosopher from the past."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, do you often read such books?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't read such serious books very often. I like reading, so I sometimes read simple books, just the parts I'm interested in. Most of the specialized books are just for interior decoration," I answered as I put the book back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee," Izumi said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But, as expected of a lecturer's son."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Because I don't think ordinary high school students are interested in that kind of thing."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...I don't like to think I'm influenced by him."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said that because I didn't want to think that I was living the same kind of life as my brother and father, who were very talented. I don't think I could live the same way as them and be like them. Thinking about it that way, I felt like I was a degraded copy of them, and it made me feel bad.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think you've been influenced by him to the fullest."</p>
<p class="calibre6">But, strangely Izumi said that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Is that so?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded in a terribly honest tone, "Yes," and I let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi then left my room and began vacuuming the upstairs hallway again. I followed her out of my room and down into the living room.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">The weather remained clear throughout the rest of the day. In the afternoon, the temperature rose and it became quite hot. However, since we had a practice match scheduled for the following day, today's practice was light and we were not too tired.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the way home, Yuriko approached me at the bicycle parking lot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, can we go by Ichishou for a minute?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Ichishou stands for Irisawa Municipal First Elementary School, where Yuriko and I attend to.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Tln : Irisawa Shiritsu Dai Ichi Shougakkou, Ichishou</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Today, my cousin is having a soccer match. She's only in the fourth grade. Would you like to watch?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Since I had no plans for the evening, I said, "Okay,". Although alumni from junior high, senior high, or college occasionally came to my former team to coach, I myself had never shown up after graduating from elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As we entered the elementary school grounds, we parked our bicycles in the parking lot, just as we used to do. All around us were small bicycles of elementary school students.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It had been a long time since I had been on an elementary school ground, but it felt terribly small. On the soccer court, there are kids running around in the same uniforms we used to wear. I recognized the other team's uniform. It was a local club team. The narrow elementary school field was filled with the sound of children's voices, footsteps chasing the ball, and whistles.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Leaning against the bars in the corner of the field, we turned our attention to the field where the match was being played. The evening sun was strong and hot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Which one is Yuriko's cousin?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That girl. Her name is Miyuki-chan."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The girl on the other end of Yuriko's finger, with a short bob, gave a small and cute impression. From the looks of it, her position is the right side of the midfield. The match is a typical situation in elementary school games, where several central players from both teams, who are either physically large or technically skilled, are crowded together in a small space kicking the ball at each other. Miyuki-chan is moving around in the corner of the court, whether she wants to be involved in the game or not.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Her mother told me that she started playing soccer because of my influence."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said proudly as she watched her cousin and her juniors in action.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee. How long has she been doing this?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Two years."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. Then, I guess it can't be helped if it's still that way..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah, she's a quiet girl from the start. But she's got good muscle. I've taught her a few times, and she's very dexterous and quick to learn."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, the big barrier is that she is a little too kind and doesn't want to be actively involved in the game."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As we were talking about this, the ball rolled toward Miyuki, as if it had burst out of the center group. She was momentarily jumpy, but the ball came to her feet and she kicked it back into the middle. It was a beautiful kick. The ball went up softly, the central group swarmed again, and when it hit someone's head and spilled, the opposing keeper held it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Surely, it's a beautiful kick."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She looks like a passer."</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Tln : I don't know much about soccer, but the passer here might be like a setter/set-upper/tosser in volleyball</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, I think so. I also think that if Miyuki is going to play on that side, it would be better for her to develop in that direction. She doesn't seem like an attacker in terms of personality."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was watching the gameplay of her cousin completely from the perspective of a mentor. And I suddenly wondered if this is how my father used to watch us in elementary school.</p>


<p class="calibre6">After about ten minutes, the game was over. Miyuki-chan came running to us from among the elementary school students who had finished greeting each other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good work," Yuriko put her hand on Miyuki's head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan, did you come to see me?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. You did your best."</p>
<p class="calibre6">--- Uwah. Yuriko, who always says harsh words, is saying kind words. This is not like Yuriko who is always yelling at the bench during games.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko removed her hand from Miyuki and turned her body toward me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"This is my friend. A graduate of this school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Miyuki looks at me. Our eyes meet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had never talked to a girl this age before. When I was at a loss as to how I should treat her, "Hey. Say hello," Yuriko said to me as if she were disgusted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"H-Hello ..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said just a few words, but Miyuki was clearly scared, perhaps because of the strange pause. Her eyes were swimming.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, your smile is stiff."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I know that without being told. But this was the kindest smile I could muster. Miyuki-chan bowed and said, "Hello!" in a nervous voice to me, and then she run toward the field. The kids were all forming a circle. It seemed like they were going to do some stretching.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah~. You scared the elementary school girls. That's Kenichi for you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at me coldly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, Yuriko and I approached the bench to say hello to a coach we both knew. His name is Ishida-san, an old man who works for the municipal office, wearing a jersey and a cap. Many of the coaches on this team are parents of children on the team or alumni of the elementary school who volunteer their time, but Ishida-san had stayed on to coach the team long after his own children had graduated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, Kenichi!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Ishida-san noticed me before I could call out to him. I was a little surprised by that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hello. It's been a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I bowed my head and greeted him. Ishida-san smiles on his tanned red face and asks me questions like, "You've grown taller," and "Are you still playing soccer?". In the middle of this conversation, he shifts his gaze to Yuriko, who is standing beside me, and asks,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Your girlfriend?" he asked in a low voice. Yuriko reacted by lifting her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm Mori. I'm Kenichi's classmate. Did you forget? I'm not his girlfriend."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko smiled cheerfully, but with an intensity that seemed to bring out a vein on her head, Yuriko said her name.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah! Yuriko, is that you!? I didn't recognize you, you look so different! If I look closely, you're indeed Yuriko!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What do you mean by looking closely."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was grumbling. "Sorry," Ishida-san said to Yuriko with a laugh, and then asked,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How is Coach Sakamoto?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">He asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a moment, I was at a loss for an answer. I hadn't told the people in this club that my father had died.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"....... My father passed away. Three years ago."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh?" the coach said, and for a moment, he was speechless. I felt the atmosphere of our friendly reunion freeze. Yuriko, too, cast her eyes down beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"He was suddenly ill. It was so sudden."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So that's it...... I'm sorry. I didn't know that happened."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---No. It's I who should say so, I'm sorry I didn't report it to the club. Even though I indebted you a lot."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No no, It's okay. I'm sorry to hear that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Dad, he would show up after finishing his college work and often sat on the bench in his jacket. His intellectual appearance, which was out of place on an elementary school field, reminded me of the manager of a European professional club, and the other coaches would joke that he was the Mourinho of our club. As I was near the bench, the image of my father, dressed in a strange combination of jacket and flashy-colored soccer spikes, came to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After talking for a while about my dad, we told each other what we had been up to. Yuriko also spoke in a cheerful tone, and gradually, the cold air began to thaw again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the conversation settled down, Yuriko and I said, "We will come again," and went back to the corner of the field so as not to disturb the stretching and meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought she was just going to leave, but Yuriko said, "I'm going back with Miyuki-chan, can you wait for me?" Yuriko said. I nodded my head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While we were waiting, Yuriko picked up a soccer ball that was lying nearby and kicked it to me. The name of our elementary school is written in an oil-based pen on that ball for elementary school students. We were both in loafers and somehow kicked that ball to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The soil of the field and the surrounding scenery had hardly changed since we were here, and I was struck by a strange sensation as if time had rewound.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko kicked the ball in front of me in exactly the same way, but the only thing that didn't overlap was the image of Yuriko in her old short hair and the image of Yuriko in her current school uniform. She tried not to lift her legs too much, but I couldn't help but notice that Yuriko's skirt swayed as she kicked the ball, almost revealing her pure white thighs that weren't sunburned. It was impossible back then to think about such things while exchanging passes with Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko raised her foot lightly as she trapped the ball, which hit a pebble and bounced a little, and that's when the wind suddenly blew. She quickly held down her skirt with her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked up and our eyes met, and I looked down in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Don't look at it, stupid."</p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the one in the middle</span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7"><br class="calibre2" /></span></p><p class="calibre6">"...... You shouldn't be kicking a ball while dressed like that..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I looked at the ground, a strong ball flew. I couldn't react fast enough and the ball hit me just below my knees.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My voice came out unconsciously. When I looked up, Yuriko stared at me and clicked her tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Scary woman, I thought, and that was the only impression I had of Yuriko that had not changed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Soon, Miyuki-chan and the others had finished stretching and cleaning up their equipment. The three of us left the elementary school together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and I walked along the streets of a residential area in the evening, pushing our bicycles. The red sky was almost dark, and clouds were drifting in the sky, which had turned pale purple in the dusk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At first, Miyuki looked at me warily as she talked with Yuriko, but gradually she seemed to stop worrying about it and exchanged a few words with me as well. She told me about elementary school and her current team.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Miyuki said to me at a corner of a residential area, "See you later, Kenichi-kun". Yuriko had called me by my name, so Miyuki seemed to have imitated her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"S-See you later."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko stared at me as I replied in a gentle tone of voice, as if looking at a suspicious person.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko then gently waved her hand and said, "See you later, say hi to Oba-san too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Miyuki replied, "Okay," and went into a house just around the corner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then. Let's go home too. You should go to bed early today so that you can run properly tomorrow."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We exchanged such words on the street corner where it was getting dark and the shadows were beginning to be covered by the evening twilight, and we went back to our own houses.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">The next day was a joint practice match between the three schools at our school field. After a short period of hot, sunny days that felt like midsummer, today the rainy season had returned and gray clouds covered the sky, making it humid but not too hot, which was nice as we were playing 40-minute matches.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After preparing for the match by drawing lines and adjusting the position of the goal, I checked my bag at the baggage area to see if I had forgotten anything and noticed that my lunch box was missing. At the same time, I noticed that the light on my smartphone was blinking. I looked and saw that it was an incoming call from Izumi. Come to think of it, we haven't given each other our e-mail addresses or SNS yet. The only way to contact each other is to call each other directly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I called Izumi back. She picked up immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Ah, Kenichi-kun. You forgot your lunch box.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah, I just noticed."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Do you want me to bring it?』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I'm sorry. I'm thinking of buying something at a convenience store or something, so I'm fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Don't worry about it. I'm in the mood to walk outside too, so I'll bring it with me.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">It felt strange to be reserved to Izumi who said so, so I decided to ask her to bring it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"........ I'm sorry, but can I ask you to do that for me? Do you know the way? There's a bus that goes to our high school. If you get off there, you shouldn't get lost. It's called "Irizawa High School."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Then, I'll go with that.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I'm sorry, even though it's your day off. You don't have to come in a hurry."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Understood. I'll call you when I get there,』 Izumi said, and hung up the phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the field, the other two teams were just beginning to warm up for their match.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While many of the club members were gathering at the field to watch the game, I remained in the baggage area by the school building to wait for Izumi to call me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With my cell phone in my hand and my back leaning against the wall, I sat in a gym-like position and watched the match that had started on the field in the distance. The wild coaching voices, like angry shouts and curses, which are characteristic of soccer games, echoed up to here.</p>
<p class="calibre6">About halfway through the second half of the first match, I received a call from Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『I just arrived in front of the school.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you. I'm on my way there in a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">After exchanging such words on the phone, I sat up and started walking toward the school gate when Yuriko, who was washing the water tank at the water tap near the baggage area, gave me a look.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm? Kenichi, are you going somewhere?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well. I forgot my lunch box today. I asked her to bring it for me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is it that relative of yours, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is she here right now?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I nodded, Yuriko said, "Can I go with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"The other day you said you would introduce me. I want to meet her too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko put the water tank under the tap after washing and took a handkerchief towel out of her shorts to wipe her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied so, thinking it was a good opportunity. Together with Yuriko, I walked to the school gate where Izumi was. Under cloudy skies, a humid breeze was blowing, and the leaves on the trees on both sides of the paved road leading to the school gate were rustling and swaying.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi was standing outside the grounds near the school gate with her hands clasped behind her back. She seemed to arrange her hair according to her mood, but today her hair was pulled back behind one ear in a small bun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That girl?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at Izumi in the distance, as if she was evaluating. She was dressed in a short-sleeved T-shirt and a long skirt. Izumi may have noticed us, too, and smiled and waved her hand at us.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sorry, for making you come here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I approached her, Izumi took down her bag, pulled out my lunch box wrapped in a cloth, and handed it to me, saying, "Here, something you forgot."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who had been watching this exchange from a couple of steps away, then came and,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hello."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She greeted Izumi with a smile.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/X46M6jk/000016.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">TLN : Pardon my intrusion but, Yuriko is so adorable</span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7"><br class="calibre2" /></span></p><p class="calibre6">For a moment, Izumi looked puzzled, but even so, she returned Yuriko's greeting, saying, "Oh, hello...". I felt I had to introduce her, and was about to open my mouth when Yuriko began to introduce herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nice to meet you. I'm Mori Yuriko, Kenichi's friend. You must be Izumi Rina-san, right? Kenichi told me about you. I went to the same elementary school, junior high school, and high school as Kenichi, and I live near where you live."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, I see....... I'm Izumi Rina, nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi bowed her head timidly. It somehow reminded me of when we first met. I could feel the same stiffness in Izumi now as she greeted Yuriko. I don't think she is the type of person who is extremely shy, but from what I've seen so far, she's a nervous girl when she meets new people.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sorry to bother you on your day off. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I interrupted from the side. Izumi raised her bowed head, turned her face to me, and shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's okay. I had no club activities today, so I didn't have anything to do.---Then, I'm going to go. Do your best in club activities."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Izumi said this, Yuriko stepped forward with a smile still on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, Izumi-san. Would you like to watch the match? It's about to start soon. After all, you've come all the way here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Having said that, Izumi stayed still, as if reserved.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, But ........Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Parents and others usually come to see the match. It's totally fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi glanced at me. I didn't say anything, but she replied to Yuriko with a smile, "Then, just a few minutes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay. I'll show you where the parents and the others' seats are."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko led Izumi and walked toward the field. As I saw them off, I returned to the baggage area with the lunch box that Izumi had brought for me.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">Before long, the first match between the two schools we had invited was over. I took my blue and white school uniform and went out to the field to warm up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi was sitting in a pipe chair in the corner of the parents' tent, looking at me. When our eyes met, she gave me a small hand wave.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I somehow raised my hand up in return as I stretched. Then I noticed that the other members around me were looking at me. "Who is that? Sakamoto's acquaintance?" one of them asked, and I replied that she was a relative of mine. Since he was not a guy I talked to very often, he did not pursue the matter further, but they looked at me and Izumi alternately for a while with suspicion, which made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When it's time to start the match, the starter players line up by the side of the field and have the first-year players, who will act as referees, check their equipment before entering the field.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The two teams faced each other across the centerline, greeted each other, formed a circle, and then spread out on the field. As I took my position as a defensive midfielder and waited for the opponents to kick off, I glanced at Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I was surprised by an unexpected sight.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who was supposed to be on the bench earlier, is sitting next to Izumi, who is sitting on a pipe chair amongst the parents. The two seemed to be exchanging some words. Yuriko was smiling and moving her mouth, and Izumi was in a posture with her hands on her knees, her face turned toward Yuriko, listening to what she was saying with a consoling smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---I wondered what they were talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a moment, all of my attention was focused on the two of them when the whistle sounded, signaling the start of the game.</p>
<p class="calibre6">All at once, the players around me started to move, and I came to myself and returned my gaze to the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They follow the ball's path, look around the entire field, and take their positions in anticipation of what is coming next.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I tried to put the two of them out of my mind and concentrate on soccer. I tried to keep abreast of the constantly changing situation on the field, and when I received the ball, I would pass it to where the opponent's defense was weak, then, when I saw an opportunity, I would attack up, get into a supporting position to create a path for my teammates to pass, and run to cover for a defender who had just moved up. I continued to play the same defensive midfielder-style play that has become so ingrained in my body.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even so, when the ball crossed the field, I couldn't help but notice Izumi and Yuriko out of the corner of my eye.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">One goal was scored by a striker and the ball I kicked went straight into the goal, and the game ended with a score of 2 to 0.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even though it was cloudy, it was late June, and everyone was sweating after running around for more than an hour. The players from the two schools, both drenched in sweat and dirt, greeted each other after the match and returned to their benches.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko has already returned from the spectator seats and was handing paper cups filled with drinks to the players as they came up from the field, along with Tachibana and the other first-year students on the bench.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Here. Good work."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Still breathing roughly right after the match, I gulped down the lukewarm sports drink in the paper cup that Yuriko had given me in one go and exhaled heavily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat down on a bench and threw the paper cups into a nearby garbage bag. Then I pulled down my socks, removed my legs guard, and stretched my legs as I sat down. From now on, we will have a one-hour break. After that, we will play one more match, and that will be the end of our practice schedule for the day.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Congratulations on scoring a goal."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I heard a voice like a boss praising his subordinate. I looked to the side and saw Yuriko about to sit down next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's been a long time since you took a free kick. When was the last time?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......It's been about half a year."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It was a good shot. Even if Neuer had been the keeper, I think the ball still would have gone in."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said jokingly. I chuckled bitterly and replied, " As expected, that's not going to happen."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We talked about it casually as we looked at the empty field. The wind blew and the dust swirled in the middle of the field. There was a moist rainy season breeze blowing, which was pleasant to my sweaty body. Yuriko sat next to me and took a sip from a paper cup of sports drink. Then she opened her mouth to say, "Oh, that's right."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"By the way, Izumi-san said she's going home after this match."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at Izumi. She had just gotten out of her pipe chair with her bags. Perhaps sensing our eyes on her, Izumi looked at ours, smiled, and waved her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I raised my hand in return, and beside me, Yuriko was also waving her hand in a small gesture. Somehow, seeing this, I felt that Yuriko had become close to Izumi. Izumi then walked toward the school gate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Izumi-san, she enjoyed the match, you know. It was the first time she had seen a live soccer match."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm," I chimed in. Then I asked her something that had been bothering me for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What were you and Izumi talking about earlier?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko kept staring straight at Izumi's back as she walked away and did not answer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... It's a secret."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I urged her, Yuriko said so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's a secret. It has nothing to do with Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm not bad-mouthing Kenichi or talking about anything embarrassing."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying this, Yuriko stood up from the bench.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm hungry. I'm going to eat my lunch."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She strode steadily toward the baggage area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I muttered to myself, felt a bit fuzzy by the secret, and after stretching, I headed for the baggage area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The soccer club is a large club with more than twenty members, thus there are several groups of members, just like in a class.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I, along with Nagai, a few other club members with whom I had some conversation to some extent, and Tachibana, who had her eye on Nagai, settled down in the shade of the school building balcony to eat the bento that Izumi had brought to me. Yuriko is eating her lunch with another group of sophomores a short distance away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the way there, Nagai spoke to me, "Hey."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"The girl that was sitting in the tent, is she your girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">The surrounding boys and Tachibana, who was standing next to Nagai, reacted with a twitch as they were listening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---- No. She is my relative."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied, thinking, that relatives are a very convenient relationships in some way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Heh. She's cute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. ........"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Indeed, Izumi's hair, clothes, and appearance gave a dainty impression, so I thought that even from a distance, there was something about her that made her stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Muu," Tachibana, who likes Nagai, frowned as she heard our conversation. Perhaps she didn't like the fact that he praised another girl.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why did Sakamoto-senpai's relative come to watch the match? She seemed to be talking with Mori-senpai as well. What kind of relationship do you all have?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana asked me in a sullen tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"As I said before, we are relatives. She just met Yuriko for the first time a while ago. Maybe they were talking about something related to me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana stared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Senpai, you seem to be a plain guy, but you seem to be more flashy in your relationships with girls than I expected. I'm getting a little suspicious about you and Mori-senpai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Not suspicious. Not at all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana looked unconvinced and narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I ignored her words and ate the rest of my lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Does that girl live around here?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai said, and the rice stuck in his throat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He coughed, drank water from his bottle in a hurry, and swept up the grains of rice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? You mean Izumi?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm. So her name is Izumi-san," Nagai said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yeah, I nodded my head and let the conversation drift away, saying only, "nearby," as to where Izumi lived.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought it would be troublesome if he asked for her contact information or something, but Nagai did not go that far. I guess it was just a casual conversation, like "I saw a cute girl on the roadside."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I finished my lunch, wrapped it in a cloth, and put it in my bag.</p>
<p class="calibre6">One more match to go. I don't feel that fatigued. Maybe I can run until the end. I stretched lightly and let the fresh air fill my lungs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Suddenly, I felt a dazzling light, and casually looked up at the sky to find a gap in the clouds that had covered the sky. The sun was shining from there, and on the ground, a strip of light was forming.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">The second match of the day ended around 3:00 p.m. as the sun began to set.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As expected, after two matches in a row, both teams moved slowly and played defensively against each other, and the match ended in a scoreless draw.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I played the second game as well, and after the match, my legs felt heavy like lead, and my feet were sore from wearing spikes for so long.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I massaged my feet by the bench after the match, thinking, my legs are going to be heavy for the rest of the night.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, we cooled down and maintained the field. After the club activities ended, I changed into my school uniform and rode home on my bicycle with Yuriko. I was too tired to pedal my bike, and Yuriko laughed at me, saying, "Kenichi, you're slow."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I played two matches."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You look very weak."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said in a playful tone. As we cycled slowly side by side, a car passed by us, and Yuriko's school uniform skirt swayed in the breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We eventually parted ways, and I finally returned home late in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Welcome home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I entered the living room, Izumi, who was sitting alone reading a paperback book, looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm home. Where's Mom?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She's out having tea with a friend from the neighborhood."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Is that so?, I said, putting down my club enamel bag, unfastening the second button of my shirt, and sitting down in the chair across from Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After two matches, my body was still very tired. My joints ached, my legs were sore, and I felt drowsy as if my consciousness was blurring.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, would you like something to drink?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi got up from her seat, took an orange juice from the refrigerator, filled a glass with ice, and handed it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thanked her, took the glass, and drank the sweet, cold juice with a slurp. The sound of ice hitting the glass echoed faintly in the living room, which was starting to become dark in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm so grateful that you brought my lunch today. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Izumi smiled and gently shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No problem. And I enjoyed watching the match, too. Kenichi-kun, you scored a goal, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah. That was after a while since I could kick a ball well."</p>
<p class="calibre6">After saying that, I drank the orange juice again. The sourness of the juice was soothing to my tired body. I let out a breath and asked Izumi about that matter.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What were you and Yuriko talking about today when the match was going on?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Izumi gave me a complicated look and chuckled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's a secret."</p>

<p class="calibre6">This again, I thought, and I let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko told me that too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I told her, Izumi smiled playfully and said, "Girls have their own secrets."</p>
<p class="calibre6">While we were talking, I finished my orange juice and got up to take a shower. Izumi also went back to her room to prepare dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I went into the bathroom and took a cold shower on my head. The cold water flowed from my head and spiraled down my legs, cooling my fatigued heated muscles.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---However, I wonder what they were talking about at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was still curious. They seemed to talk for a long time during the match, but I wondered if they shared the same interest. I have no idea what they were talking about, but since I was the only connection between the two girls, they were probably talking about something related to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took a shower from my head and closed my eyes, and the image of those two in the tent talking about something came to my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Sweat and dirt had been washed away by the cold water, and my body felt much refreshed, but a vague, indefinable feeling seemed to be building up in my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even after living together and even after more than a decade of being together, understandably I only know a part of what these girls are thinking and what kind of personalities they have, both about Izumi and Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">That thought made me feel lonely and empty. As I turned off the water, I could faintly hear the sounds of the city echoing in the distance.</p>
