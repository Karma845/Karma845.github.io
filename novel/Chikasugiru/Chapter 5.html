<h2 class="calibre5">Chapter 5 - The Taste Of Rain And Sweat</h2><span><a name="more" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre"></a></span>


<p class="calibre6">The month changed and it was July.</p>
<p class="calibre6">That day, after the fourth period, Yuriko came to my classroom with a bundle of printouts.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Here. Please check it. Circle whether you will or will not participate by the summer vacation and submit it to me or Nakata-sensei. Akari is also fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As we were about to open our lunch boxes, we stopped and looked at the printout we had received. The sheet of paper, titled "Information on Summer Training Camp," began with a greeting to parents, followed by the schedule of training camps during this summer vacation, with a "participate/not participate" option and a signature line for parents below the cut line.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was looking through it, Yuriko pulled out a nearby chair and placed a mini bag with a handle on the desk where Nagai and I were sitting together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked, Yuriko replied, "lunchbox."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you going to eat here, too?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is it bad?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko narrowed her eyes and replied with a pout.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, not at all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai and I put our prints in our own bags, and then we started eating together with Yuriko. Yuriko took out a small thermos and a lunch box wrapped in a dark blue cloth, smaller than mine and Nagai's, and began to bring the lunch to her mouth with plastic chopsticks. Her tone of voice was a little rough, perhaps because she played soccer with the boys, but her eating manners were surprisingly neat, even from when she was a child.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Like our classmates around us, we chatted and ate, talking about club activities and tests.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How are your studies going?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko asked as she poured barley tea (presumably because of its color) into a cup from her thermos.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So-so," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Whenever I have a break from club activities, I have too much time on my hands, but my pace of studying slows down."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's the opposite of what happened to me. How come your grades don't drop?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said that, Yuriko sullenly said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I study every day, even when I have club activities---How about Nagai?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Yuriko asked him about it, he looked a little gloomy, which was unusual for Nagai, who always has a poker face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...If I don't do my best this time, I'm going to be sent to a summer course at a prep school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Seriously? Nagai, your grades aren't that bad."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My parents only allow me to go to national universities, so if I can't make the top ten in our grade at this school, I should start preparing. But I will still participate in club activities. I heard there is a course that starts from the evening."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That' s tough."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, feeling sorry for him losing his vacation time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, I don't feel like being on summer vacation at all," Nagai said, as if complaining. Then he said,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Can I come over to your place the next weekend? Let's study together. Studying for exams by myself is getting a little boring. I need some stimulation."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, my house?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was shaken by the unexpected suggestion. Reflexively looking for a good excuse to refuse, I looked at Yuriko for help. But she immediately followed him up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Can I come too? The more people there are, the more we can teach each other. Isn't that good? Kenichi, please ask person at your home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The person at home. Although she did not mention the name, this was clearly Izumi. Yuriko had called my mother "auntie" since she was in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why not Nagai's house?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said that, Yuriko acted in a manner that was unusual for her, saying, "Kenichi's house is closer, so I'd rather go there."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then why don't we just go to your place? You don't have to move."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, not at my place. My father would be angry if I let a boy in my room. For some reason, he's been very strict about it lately."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Here comes the girlish excuse......Da*n, what should I do? If Nagai is coming to my house, I'll have to explain about Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Err, a relative is over at my place right now......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, do we bother you?"</p><p class="calibre6">When I said this, Nagai became reserved.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I mean, it's not like it bothers me, it's more like......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I clumsily mumbled, "It's okay. Kenichi's relative is a kid I know too, right, Kenichi?" Yuriko interrupted from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kid?" Nagai said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is she a child?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, well, yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I'm not lying, because she's not an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even after what had happened with Hoshino-san the other day, I could not tell him that the relative was the girl who had come to the practice match the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai took it as if I was taking care of a little child, and he was like,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, I won't force you to."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied in a small voice, "Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was staring at me with pouted lips as I repeated my vague response.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>


<p class="calibre6">After school that day, I went down to the entrance early and waited for Yuriko. It was already the period to prepare for the test, and there were no club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a somewhat relaxed air in the school building after a long day. Outside the window, thick white clouds were drifting low in the sky. For a while, I leaned my back against a nearby wall and looked toward the stairs where the students were coming down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After waiting about ten minutes, Yuriko came down to the entrance with two other girls.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I approached the girls and called out to her. Yuriko, with her bag, slung over her shoulder, looked up in puzzlement when she noticed me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, it's Kenichi. Do you have business with me?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I wouldn't talk to you if I didn't have business with you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">During our brief exchange, the two friends who had stopped with Yuriko glanced at me as if they were peeking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is this about club activities? Will it be quick?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well......if possible, can we talk about it on the way home......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Despite my reluctance to say so, I looked at Yuriko's two friends as I said this, and they chuckled and then waved mischievously at Yuriko saying, "Take your time, Mori-san," as if they were trying to be considerate, and went out the entrance first.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, wait, Sacchan, Katou-san."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko called out to the backs of the two girls, but they only smiled at us, as if they had some mischievous idea of what we were up to.</p><p class="calibre6">"Muu. I was about to stop by with my friends. Read the air."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I listened to Yuriko's complaints, we walked to the bicycle parking lot, and then we both got on our bicycles side by side and rode along the school route, just as we do when returning home from club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The sky was still bright, unlike the usual time after club activities. There were many overlapping clouds covering the house, but there were gaps here and there, and many shafts of light were falling on the city in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We had been riding our bicycles for a while without talking to each other because of the noise of cars on the national highway, but when we stopped at a traffic light, I started talking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What was that at lunch today?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"And what's that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"About my place. You know Izumi is there, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I know. But you don't have anything to be guilty of, do you? You didn't want him to come to your house? Then why didn't you just say no?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not like that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then that's fine, right? I also wanted to go to Kenichi's house after a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The traffic light turns green. We started pedaling our bicycles side by side again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why are you so secretive about Izumi-san? I'm sure Nagai is not the kind of guy who would just go around telling everyone about it for fun, and if you explain it properly it won't cause any misunderstandings."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Yuriko told me, I kept my mouth shut. That's true, I think so, too. Nagai is not that kind of guy. Whenever I hear something that has to do with Izumi, I always become strangely flustered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, maybe you don't want other boys to know about Izumi-san? It's not just that it's too much trouble to explain?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was startled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I looked at Yuriko, she was looking straight ahead. Her hair was fluffy and blowing in the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......that's not true."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although I replied, the small, downcast tone in my voice showed that I wasn't sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko glanced at me with her big and beautiful eyes. For a moment, our gazes met. She immediately returned her gaze forward. Then, perhaps intending to change the subject, Yuriko suddenly said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It seems the rainy season is ending early this year."</p>
<p class="calibre6">In response to her words, I looked up at the sky. Although there was light shining here and there, most of the sky was covered with gray clouds.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......So?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nothing. That's all. If we're going to have a study session, make sure you invite Izumi-san, too. We promised the other day that we would meet again."</p>

<p class="calibre6">We soon entered the residential area where we grew up and where the smell of daily life wafted through the air. It is a town that could be anywhere, lined with characterless houses and parks, national chain convenience stores and supermarkets, and small, desolate private stores. Perhaps the wind was strong in the sky above, and the clouds moved every second, accompanied by a change in the appearance of the belt-shaped light. The city was dimming and brightening repeatedly in a short period of time. Even the visible colors seemed to change slightly as the light shone in different ways.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">"So that's what happened."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I explained the situation to Izumi at dinner.</p>


<p class="calibre6">I was going to refuse the suggestion if she gave me a reaction that she was bothered, but her eyes lit up when she heard that Yuriko and another friend were coming to study with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, I have to prepare."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? Prepare for what?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Making snacks and other things."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Surprisingly, Izumi was eager to participate. She looked as if she was looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't think you have to go that far. I mean, aren't we bothering Izumi's study?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Izumi shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I also want to see Mori-san again. I also want to thank her for the gifts she brought me the other day. "</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see......You guys were getting along so well."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi nodded, carefully pouring the tea into my mother's empty teacup. On this day, my mother came home early after a while, and the three of us had dinner together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother sipped the tea Izumi had poured for her and quietly placed the teacup on the table.</p>

<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan, she's gonna come?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Apparently."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It has been a long time since I've seen her. I saw her at the supermarket the other day, and she looked so cute with her hair styled up."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah, well, I guess so," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko hadn't been to my house since we were in the sixth grade.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She used to come over to my house a lot. Most of the time, it was just a gathering to play video games with the boys of the same grade who were on the same soccer team and my big brother who played with us, but my mother, who said she wanted a daughter, was so happy when Yuriko came. They used to talk in the living room, leaving me, my big brother, and other friends to play video games and have tea together, and they used to make snacks at home together. Many years have passed since then.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, I'm totally fine, so please tell Mori-san and your friends so."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said this as she finished her meal and put down her chopsticks. She had only met Yuriko once, and it was her first time meeting Nagai, but she didn't seem to have any particular hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">What's that, I thought. Maybe I'm the only one who's think it too much.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks for the food."</p><p class="calibre6">I sat up, cleaned my own tableware, and went back to my room. As I lay on my bed, I contacted Yuriko on the SNS app.</p>
<p class="calibre6">《Izumi, she said you can come. She said she wanted to see you too.》</p>
<p class="calibre6">I lay on my back with the phone still in my hand and stared at the ceiling. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs from downstairs. Izumi, I thought. The sound of my mother and Izumi going up the stairs was slightly different. Izumi's footsteps were calmer, and whether it was because of her lighter weight or her calm personality, the sounds were more subdued. It had only been less than a month, but I had already become so used to having Izumi at home that I was able to discern such a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The phone vibrated briefly in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The screen of the SNS application I displayed said, 《Got it. Give my regards to Izumi-san,》 was all that was written on the screen.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">At lunchtime the next day, as if trying to blend in with the hustle and bustle, I said to Nagai in a slightly quieter voice, "You know,". "Hm?" he asked as he sat down across from me and stuck a straw in his juice pack.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"The relative I mentioned yesterday is the girl who came to watch our practice match the other day."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai stopped moving for a moment and then looked at me with a slightly surprised expression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"For real?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded. Then Nagai, too, lowered his voice and asked,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Do you live with her?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded again in response to his questions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Since last month. It's kind of hard to say."</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a moment, Nagai opened his mouth slightly, as if to say something, but after a pause, as if swallowing his words,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"--- I bet," He said, with a sympathetic nuance. I felt a bit relieved at his words. Nagai is not that kind of guy, but I wondered what I would do if he were to make fun of me or tease me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But, are you sure? I'm going to your place under those circumstances. Doesn't she also have to study for a test or something?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. We talked about it yesterday. She said she's totally fine with it. Besides, she went to a prestigious school that sends a lot of students to Tokyo University every year, so she can probably teach you even the hard parts. She will be a great help."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? That would be very helpful."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai laughed as he said that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Besides, I was a little curious about her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai's words and cheerful expression made my heart ache a little.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Can I ask you how it happened, what's going on? I don't want to step on any landmines when I go to your place."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Her parents are away on a long business trip."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I replied shortly, Nagai was taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? Is that all?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yeah, I nodded my head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She came to my house because we were the only place within her school zone where she could be taken care of. There were no landmines or anything."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. But you must be getting along well with her since she comes to see your club activities. I also have some relatives close to my age, but I don't talk to them much because I don't have much of a relationship with them."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No. That time I forgot my lunch box, so she brought it to me. It was Yuriko who invited her to watch the game."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. I was surprised at that time because I thought she was Sakamoto's girlfriend, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I couldn't respond well to that remark. I just smiled bitterly and replied, " Of course not,". Nagai, and the words I said, brought up some mysterious and complicated feelings.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The day before Yuriko and Nagai arrived at my house, Izumi had been in the kitchen making cookies since the evening. When I went down from my room to the living room, I could smell the sweet, savory aroma wafting through the room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, try these."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying that, Izumi handed me a plate filled with cookies. They were star-shaped, heart-shaped, diamond-shaped, and other shapes and sizes that all looked familiar to me. Perhaps she had used the molds we have at home. My mother had made the same shape for me and my brother a long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I picked up one of the cookies offered to me and took a bite. It was slightly sweeter than the one I remembered, but I thought it was cooked well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's good, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? I'm glad to hear that. Then, I'll make more like these."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although I thought it was an appropriate impression, Izumi said happily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. Sorry for making you do this."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's okay. It didn't take that much time, and it's a nice relaxation, so don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying that, she returned to the kitchen, where bowls, stirrers, and aluminum foil had been set out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, I'll go buy drinks for tomorrow."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I suggested, since I didn't want Izumi to be the only one preparing for tomorrow. She turned her face and said with a smile, "Thank you."</p>


<p class="calibre6">The next day's study session was scheduled for 1 p.m. Five minutes before that time, the intercom rang. Izumi, who was sitting on the sofa reading a textbook in a red checkered short-sleeved shirt and three-quarter-length jeans, stopped herself as I stood up and approached the monitor in the living room. Yuriko is shown standing in a blue knit shirt and white shorts. Nagai is still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After a formal exchange with Yuriko over the intercom, I opened the front door. As usual, it was a cloudy day in the rainy season, and the air was sultry and humid. Yuriko was standing in front of the gate at the end of the front yard, a white tote bag slung over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the left one</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">When I stepped outside, "Hi," Yuriko said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I let her in, and Izumi also came down to the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hello, Mori-san. Thank you for your kindness the other day," she said with a soft smile and a small bow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Excuse me. How are you feeling now?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, too, was showing a formal behavior and pleasant expression that she rarely shows to me. Then my mother came out of her room on the first floor, her footsteps clattering.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan, it's been a while. Are you well?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She returned the bow politely to my mother as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Auntie, it's been a while. I'm sorry to bother you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The three of them started a kind of standing around talking, and I waited in the corner for it to settle down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Their conversation went on for a few minutes, then my mother said, "Well, take your time," and went back to her room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then we went up the stairs to my room. I had cleaned up my room in the morning, set up two folding desks, and prepared a cushion. It was a little hot and humid, so I turned on the air conditioner as I entered the room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh. It looks more mature."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said as she entered the room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"When you were in elementary school, there were anime posters and stuff like that all over the place. Where did they go?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi, who had gone to her room to pick up her study materials and came in a little later, was tilting her head while clutching her textbooks to her chest, as if she had heard a snippet of the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It doesn't matter what happened in the past."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What? Are you embarrassed? Do you want me to say more?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you a sadistic?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I ended the conversation before Yuriko could say anything about my past and took out my notebook and writing materials from my study desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and Yuriko sat down facing each other at one of the two desks, and I laid out my study materials at the other desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm, that was uncle's, wasn't it? So it was given to you, Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at the bookshelf by the wall and said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's right."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You read books like that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No way. I barely read them."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I guess so," Yuriko said, sitting down on the cushion and taking a notebook out of her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Before long, Nagai also arrived at my house. When I went outside to pick him up, I was told that the train had been delayed. He was wearing brown shorts and a dark blue polo shirt. His hair smelled of wax or something. He looked a little more stylish than when we play with the other boys.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I went up to the room again with him, "It's Nagai," Yuriko, who was sitting and spreading out her study materials, responded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sorry, I'm late."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He replied so to Yuriko. Then Izumi, who had been staring at Nagai like a vigilant rabbit, stood up and opened her mouth, "Um."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm Izumi Rina. I'm a relative of Kenichi-kun---"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, I've heard about you. I'm Nagai, from the same club as Sakamoto."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He said, " Hello," and bowed his head slightly. Izumi said politely, " Nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nagai's position, right there."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they had finished greeting each other, I interrupted them and said to Nagai. "OK," Nagai said and put down his luggage, and sat down.&nbsp; He was next to Yuriko and in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, I'll bring the cookies."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, then I'll go with you. I'll bring the drinks."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Izumi and I sat up, we went downstairs together. Unlike my room, which was now crowded with the four of us, the first floor was quiet. My mother was probably on the phone at work in her room, and her voice, which sounded like she was reprimanding someone, was leaking into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My mom's pissed."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I said this, Izumi wryly smiled as she took a large plate of cookies that had been covered with plastic wrap and said, " It must be tough work, isn't it?" Then she turned to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-san, she knows Kenichi-kun pretty well, doesn't she?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She seemed to know Kenichi-kun's father very well."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. That girl was on the same soccer team as me in elementary school, and my dad used to teach us there. She had been a soccer fan since she was young. She came over here frequently with our teammates, so she's close with my family. She knows Ryou-kun, too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said, looking at the plate of cookies she had made. She took off the plastic wrap, crumpled it up, and tossed it into the non-burnable trash.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi looked up and said, "No. It's nothing. It's just something that came to mind," she said, and then smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm," I replied, opening the refrigerator and pulling out bottles of drinks. Then I put four glasses, a bottle of tea, and a bottle of cola on a stainless steel tray. I walked up the stairs with Izumi and returned to my room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I made these yesterday. Please enjoy them while you study."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Yuriko and Nagai were chatting, Izumi placed a plate of cookies on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, perhaps you don't like sweets?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Izumi asked in a rushed tone of voice, Yuriko smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, it's okay. Thank you, Izumi-san. Can I try one?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Of course. I hope it suits your taste.---What do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi asked Yuriko, as she bit into a cookie.</p>

<p class="calibre6">"It's delicious," Yuriko complimented. Izumi looked pleased to be told so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I held the glasses out in front of the four of them and said, " Have a drink as you like," and placed the plastic bottles on the desk with a thud.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai and I poured cola into the glasses, while Yuriko and Izumi poured tea.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, for the next two hours, talk about anything other than study-related topics is prohibited. We will have two sets of two hours with a break in between, and finish around 6:00 p.m., okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Once the preparations were complete, Yuriko showed her management skills and suggested the day's menu.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay," Izumi said, and I - and maybe Nagai, too - replied, "Yes," feeling as if we were in charge of the practice in the club, and Yuriko activated the timer app on her phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Thus began the day's study session.</p>


<p class="calibre6">I wonder why I can concentrate better when there are people around me than when I am studying alone. Everyone was busy running their pens over their notebooks, the atmosphere was nice, and I made more progress than I would have if I had been studying alone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After about 30 minutes, Nagai asked me, "Hey," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How do you translate this?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai underlined the English sentences in the exercise book with a pen. I stopped my studies and looked at them. It was a long, complex sentence with a number of relative pronouns in it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Let's see, this whole second half of the sentence depends on this 'Woman', so it would be better to translate it from here....... But what does this 'one' mean?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not simply "one person," is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't know?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hmm, when we both groaned, confused by the long sentence and stuck on a small part, Izumi looked up and asked in a whisper, "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi, can you translate this?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took Nagai's exercise book, placed it at an angle so that Izumi could see it, and pointed to the part in question.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, without thinking or stammering, she smoothly translated the English sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh. Thank you, Izumi-san."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai, who was listening beside me, raised his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was a bit surprised, too, and said, " You're amazing, Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're welcome," Izumi said with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She doesn't look like the hardworking type, but it seems that attending a well-known preparatory school is no joke. When I looked closely, I noticed that Izumi's English textbook was different from ours in that it contained less Japanese and more English sentences in small letters, giving it a somewhat more prestigious look.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then we would ask Izumi whenever we ran into a difficult problem. She was immediately able to tell us what we wanted to know.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While the three of us worked together, or rather Izumi taught us most of the time, Yuriko spent the entire time highlighting in her textbook, running her pen through her notebook, and studying on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you, Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're welcome."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had approached Izumi to ask her to teach me, but when I moved away from her and sat back down on the cushion, my eyes suddenly met Yuriko's, who was sitting diagonally in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at me as she held the cookie in her hand. She took a bite of the pointed part of the star-shaped cookie Izumi had made.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A few moments later, the alarm Yuriko had set rang. She reached over and immediately stopped it. We studied for a little while longer before putting our pens down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai and I breathed heavily. The air rapidly loosened. Izumi, too, took a sip of her tea, putting her pen in a cylinder-shaped pen case. Then, next to her, Yuriko said, "I have a warning."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi and Nagai, don't ask too many questions to Izumi-san"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Nagai and I raised our voices,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Because it will decrease Izumi-san's study time. You should only do that when you can't really figure it out until the very last minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm, surely."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai mumbled so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I didn't think we were taking up that much of her time, but we apologized to Izumi, thinking it would have been a burden on her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But she smiled wryly and replied, "Don't worry, teaching is also a good way to learn." Even so, Yuriko was still slightly pouting.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">Time passed, and the sunlight that shone through the window of the room gradually changed its color, and by nearly 6 pm, at the end of the second set of two hours, the sun had turned into a setting sun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Yuriko's timer rang, I let out a big breath. Even though we had a short break, as expected, my head was tired after four hours of work.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, I'm tired."</p><p class="calibre6">Yuriko crossed her arms and stretched them out in front of her as if to stretch. In front of her, Izumi gently closed her notebook and Nagai rubbed her temple with his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Everyone was tired in their own way, after all, and they spent some time drinking tea and munching on Izumi's cookies, of which there were only a few left.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Before long, Yuriko straightened her back and then asked, "How did it go, guys? Have you made progress?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Greatly," Nagai replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi-san taught me a lot. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Not at all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Nagai thanked her, Izumi shook her head in a small way with her usual nice demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko finished the rest of the tea in her glass and asked, "What are we going to do after this? We've already done everything we were supposed to do, should we break up?" She asked the others.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Since we're here, I think I'd like to continue the session a little longer. If it's all right with Sakamoto and the others."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai looked at me and said, "What do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm fine. Our dinner time is around 8 p.m. or so. What about Izumi?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm totally fine with it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I received a frank answer that made me wonder where she had learned it. She looked a little tired, but she was still smiling, and I could sense that she had plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, let's take a break and have a little extra time."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Yuriko summed up the conversation, I heard the shaking of the cell phone on my desk. I got up and looked at the screen and saw my brother's name on it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes. What's up?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I picked up the phone, I heard my brother's flashy voice saying,&nbsp; 『Hey, are you free right now?" 』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm studying for the test."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『You're doing something boring.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks to you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, and my brother laughed briefly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Well, whatever. If you have time after this, why don't we go out for dinner? With Rina-chan too.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at everyone. Yuriko was looking at me, perhaps curious about the call I had received, and Nagai was talking to Izumi about something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『......Yuriko and one other friend from my club are here too.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">『What, you're having a study group? I don't mind if it's just about four or so people. Invite everyone. I'm making a lot of extra money right now.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Did you get a new job?"</p><p class="calibre6">『No, I was on a radio program the other day.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was about to respond with something like, "Hmmm," when he said it so casually, but then I thought about it and realized that was pretty amazing. I was surprised after a beat and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? You never said anything about that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『I was embarrassed, so I kept quiet. Besides, mom might be worried.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Well, I guess so. But what kind of program was it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although not as major as television, radio is still mass media. For a moment, I thought of what happened to my father, and my heart pulsed strongly with a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Don't worry, it's not the same story as with dad. I mean, a master's degree student like me doesn't have that kind of influence. I was invited to be a guest commentator for a one-shot segment on an information program about youth culture. We just talked a little bit about literature and arts that are popular among young people, from pure literature to subculture content. The broadcasting area is also part of the Kanto region.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">I see, I replied, relieved to hear my brother's casual tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Well, we'll talk about it another time. If you want to go to dinner, call me back in 30 minutes. I want to be there around 7.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Got it. I'll ask the other."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I tap the End of Talk icon and place the phone on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryouichi-kun?" Yuriko quickly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You know very well, don't you?" I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I could tell by your tone of voice. What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"He asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner. I told him I had a friend coming, and he said I could bring you, and he'd treat all of us."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? Is it okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I heard he got some extra money. Do you want to go?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked Yuriko, and then I asked Izumi and Nagai, who seemed to have been listening to the conversation from the middle of it, that same question.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and Izumi replied that they wanted to go although they were slightly reserved, Nagai clearly declined, saying, "No, it's bad for Sakamoto's brother, so no thanks."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No need to be reserved. My brother is a very communicative person, and eating with strangers is nothing to him."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's right, Nagai. Kenichi's brother is a good man," added Yuriko, who was acquainted with my brother. But, "No, not this time. My family is probably preparing the meal at home," he replied. Since I didn't want to force him, I said, "Okay," and we cut the conversation short.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then I'll tell him that Yuriko and Izumi will be coming."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I grabbed my phone again and called my brother.</p>



<p class="calibre6">After that, we each studied for about 30 minutes, and that was the end of the study session for the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, I'm going home. Thank you for today, Sakamoto and Izumi-san. And Mori, too. I made a lot of progress. I'm glad we were able to study together."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yeah, I replied, and Izumi said, "Same here,". Izumi, after all, had a certain amount of social skills, and after spending half a day together, she seemed to open her heart to Nagai to a certain extent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He started to pack up his stuff, and in the middle of doing so, he said, "Oh, right," and shoved his hands in his pockets. Then, as if peeking out,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi-san, if you don't mind, can I have your contact information?" He asked Izumi</p>
<p class="calibre6">Perhaps sensing something, Yuriko looked at Nagai with a "ho".</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, ah, yeah. Sure"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi pulled out her own cell phone, though she seemed slightly bewildered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After exchanging contact information, Nagai thanked Izumi with a smile and said, "Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're welcome," Izumi replied pleasantly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Watching the two of them exchange contact information, I again felt something like the discomfort feeling I've felt a few times before. It was itchy, some kind of indefinable feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I went to the entrance to see Nagai off as he left the room with his luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The clouds that had covered the sky until noon had already drifted away, and the evening sky, which had just turned July, was stained red by the setting sun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"See you later, Sakamoto."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah, See you later. I hope your grades get better."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied and waved my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai walked out the gate of my house and walked toward the bus stop.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was the closest friend I had in high school. He's a good soccer player and a good student, but he doesn't boast about it. He's a good guy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But as I watched his back move away from me, the strange feelings that had just sprouted inside me seemed to subside, and I felt like a total idiot to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">I haven't exchanged direct contact information with Izumi. We only know each other's phone numbers. We have never texted each other, nor do we know each other's SNS accounts. Since we live together, it was enough if we could just call each other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt somewhat uncomfortable that he knew a part of Izumi that I didn't.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I can see it clearly now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko's remark the other day about not wanting other boys to know about Izumi was right.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A sigh leaked out spontaneously at the unreasonable thought that even I could not understand.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">Just before 7 p.m., my brother came to our house riding the moped he uses to get around the neighborhood. I knew immediately from the sound of the engine that he had arrived. I went downstairs and opened the front door just as the intercom rang.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yo, Kenichi."</p><p class="calibre6">My brother was wearing a black V-neck shirt and slim jeans. He was a bit more modest than usual, but the silver accessory peeking out from his open chest made him look like a flashy guy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Wanna go in?"</p><p class="calibre6">When I asked him,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I'm fine right here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He said, scratching the back of his head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mom's home right now. Should I call her?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm, well, either way."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I suggested that, given the way the conversation had been going the other day, but he gave me a vague answer for an older brother who always speaks clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought, "Well, whatever," and was about to turn on my heel to call Izumi and the others when our mother came out of the house wearing a pair of slippers. Ack, my brother saw this and frowned.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother put her both hands on her hips and suddenly said in a sharp tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuuichi, what have you been doing for six months without showing your face? I tried to call you, but you weren't answering your phone. I visited you, but you weren't there."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, mom, i-it's been a while......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As the red evening sun shone through and the plants swayed in the breeze in the cool evening garden, my mother and brother began to talk for the first time in about half a year. I stayed there, curious to see what kind of conversation would take place. I mean, mom, you went to Ryuu-kun's house?</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I was thinking of going out for dinner with Kenichi today, and that's why I came to pick him up. ...... Oh, if you don't mind, can I borrow the car? I'll bring Rina-chan and Yuriko-chan with me. ...... Or rather, would you rather come with us, mom? I'll treat you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother didn't reply, but looked my brother in the face from top to bottom and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're still dressed so flamboyantly. Is your school going well?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I'm going to a domestic academic conference in the summer, so I'm preparing for that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. Do you have enough money?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Somehow. The university will pay for me to go to the conference, including travel expenses, and I'll be teaching at a prep school from the summer vacation."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's true. At least I can earn enough money to live on my own. I make a balance every month from my part-time job and my manuscript fees. I have no problem at all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, if everything is going well, it's okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then my mother stared at my brother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi has told me a lot about you. I don't want to become a grandma yet, so I don't really want to hear about those things."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Ugh, for a moment he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Well. I always have several levels of countermeasures in place.......so......."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When my brother replied with a chuckle, as if he were joking or making some sort of apologetic comment about a scandalous company, my mother shuddered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You idiot! Why are you like this, you womanizer. Stop getting carried away!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When he was shouted at, my brother's frivolous smile turned into a bitter smile that said, "Yikes, she's mad,". It is probably only our mother who can make my brother, who was always so composed, be cornered like this.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, don't just stand there like a fool, get the two of them here now."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As if to escape, he urged me to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hmm, I replied half-heartedly, and headed back to the front door.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Izumi and Yuriko had packed their bags and were both sitting on the living room sofa. Yuriko was carrying a white tote bag that she had packed with her study materials, and Izumi was wearing a small brown pouch that she hung over her shoulder. The lights were not on, and in the dim light, the red evening sun was shining through the window, reflecting the light in various directions on the surface of the jugs and glasses on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While they were waiting, they were talking about something again. But when I opened the living room door, they were both sitting side by side in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuu-kun, he said come on."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Yuriko and Izumi nodded and stood up at the same time. They both quickly tidied themselves up, stretching the hems of their clothes and combing their hair with their hands.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What did you two talk about?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked them, Yuriko replied in a blunt tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......I was listening to Kenichi's embarrassing stories at home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I couldn't help but say, "What!?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi, really?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked her, she looked quickly at Yuriko for a moment, then replied with a mischievous smile at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No way. I didn't think I was doing anything that weird."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, fufufu, Izumi laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Like, you taught me how to play games. Or the way you took care of me at home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What? That's nothing to be embarrassed about, is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said it, Yuriko didn't change her expression, but ignored my words with a straight face and said in a businesslike tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuuichi-kun, he's waiting for us, right? Let's get out of here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As it was, Yuriko left the living room and put on a pair of blue pumps at the entrance. Izumi sat down beside her and put her feet into summery laced sandals.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the three of us went outside, my brother was still talking to my mother about something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, hello, Yuriko-chan, Rina-chan."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother turned his gaze toward us as if to escape from my mother's speech.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi bowed her head and Yuriko said to my brother in a friendly manner, "Ryuuichi-kun, it's been a long time,". When we appeared, my mother closed her mouth and stepped back from my brother. Then she crossed her arms as if holding both elbows and said to my brother, "Show your face once in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He nodded, " Got it." Then my mother turned her face toward us.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan and Rina-chan, be careful with this man."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother impatiently interrupted my mother's words, saying, "Wait a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Do you really think I'd lay my hands on a high-schooler?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"If it was you, you'd do it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's terrible. I'm not that kind of immoral person."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You don't know anything about morals."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Just in case, I'm studying public philosophy, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and Izumi were puzzled by the contentious conversation between my brother and mother.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mom, Ryuu-kun, I think such a thing is......"</p>

<p class="calibre6">When I intervened, my mother pulled back, though her cheeks puffed up slightly. Then she walked toward the front door and came right back out again, handing the car keys to my brother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She then walked to the front door and quickly came out again and handed the car keys to my brother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Be careful on your way."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother took it, saying, "Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Mother stood in the doorway,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well then, see you, Yuriko-chan. Rina-chan, see you later, too," she said to Yuriko and Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko bowed politely, "Yes, I'm sorry to bother you today," Yuriko said, "I'm off," Izumi said with a smile and an excited look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, my mother went back inside the house and I heard my brother say, "Phew," in a depressed tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How was your first conversation with mom after such a long time?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I haven't seen her in six months, so it's hard for me to talk to her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother said, as if biting down on something bitter. It is often easier to communicate with strangers who only have a superficial relationship with you than with your family members. Surprisingly, I thought my brother's weakness might be his family members. In fact, he's not very good around our mom.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Now," he said, as he turned to face us, his expression changing to its usual smiling one</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What are we going to eat? Rina-chan, what do you want?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi smiled, but shook her head in a reserved manner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Anything. I don't have any preferences."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What about you, Yuriko?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Meat."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who for some reason had been looking down from earlier, replied in an inarticulate voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked Yuriko back, she looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Meat! I want to eat meat!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">At the sudden loud voice, my brother's expression turned into a blank stare. I, who was standing right next to her, was also startled. Did this girl really want to eat meat that badly?</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, let's go to a yakiniku restaurant."</p>
<p class="calibre6">At the suggestion, yakiniku, Izumi's eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I've never been to a yakiniku restaurant."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No problem. I remember there was a restaurant in front of the station. Let's go there."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We decided where to go and got into our minicar.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">My brother parked the car in the parking lot of a yakiniku restaurant located in front of station street. It was after 7 p.m., and the town was wrapped in the dimness of evening. However, perhaps because it was also time to go home, there were many cars, the streets were brightly lit with headlights and red taillights, and there were many people on the sidewalks. High school students on bicycles rode by with their lights on, and businessmen with business bags slung over their shoulders walked down the street at a brisk pace.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Let's go."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother, who had neatly parked the car in the back, pulled out the ignition key and said so. The two girls in the back seat opened the door and I, sitting in the passenger seat, got out. It was a hot and humid evening outside, with heat rising from the asphalt.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">The clouds in the upper layers of the sky turned to sunset colors some time after the sun had set. The city was dim, but there was still a faint blue tinge in the sky, and the clouds that had been drifting high in the sky had turned to a dark red.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The four of us entered the restaurant and were shown to a booth in the non-smoking area by the waitress. My brother and I sat side by side with Yuriko and Izumi in front of us. It was dinner time and there were many customers, and the restaurant was filled with the sound of cooking meat and the savory smell of cooking meat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The air in the restaurant was slightly smoky. The beer posters on the wall and the menu list had a slight brown grease-like stain on them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the middle of the table, a round net is draped over it, with charcoal lying beneath it. Various kinds of sauce, seasonings, small plates, and splittable chopsticks were lined up on the side, and the evening city could be seen through the window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi let out a small " whoa" as she looked around the yakiniku restaurant, which was the first time she had ever been here. A waitress wearing an apron placed four glasses of water and hand towels on the table and lit the charcoal under the grill in the center of the table. The heat from the charcoal fire was slowly rising. Izumi silently gazed at the reddening coals with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What shall we have?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother asked, placing the menu next to the grill.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With that, Izumi, who had been admiring the lit coals, came to himself and replied, " Ah, I'll leave it to you," as she pulled herself away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was also fine with anything as long as she could eat meat, so we ordered the "family set," a menu with various meats and vegetables for four people, and a drink bar.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, go get us a drink. Cola for me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">After finishing the order, my brother immediately said so. I nodded my head in agreement, since I was the one who was getting treated for the meal. Besides, if Yuriko gets a part in this, she might do something stupid to me again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"OK. What do Yuriko and Izumi want?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll have a cola, too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, then, I'll have some kind of tea......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who had somehow become a bit quiet since the evening, replied modestly, and Izumi, as usual, was reserved.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Got it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I left my seat and walked through the smoky restaurant to the drink bar area. I poured drinks for four into glasses, placed them on trays, and returned to my seat.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who had been quiet up to that point, fiercely grilled the meat that was eventually brought to her, and then ate it. She ate the meat with sweet sauce and rice in large portions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi, who was experiencing yakiniku for the first time, was at first timidly placing the meat on the net with tongs, and was truly surprised whenever the grease fell onto the charcoal and the fire rose, saying "Kyaaa!" My brother found this interesting and said, "Rina-chan, you're too scared," Izumi replied with a laugh, " But," and she seemed to be enjoying her first yakiniku quite a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at Yuriko, the realist girl, thinking bitterly that she might take this kind of thing from Izumi as "flirtatious" or something. But she didn't change her expression and concentrated on grilling the meat. I received the tongs, of which there was only one, from Izumi, the beginner, while the other three grabbed the meat with chopsticks and flipped it on the net.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the meat was about half eaten, Yuriko said, "I'll have another bowl of rice," and pressed the button to call the waiter. This restaurant offered free extra rice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan, you eat quite a lot."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was a bit embarrassed and put her hand over her mouth when my brother said, as if he was impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I studied a lot today and I'm starving."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Meat and carbs are a fattening combo."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I blurted out, and she looked annoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Shut up! After the test, I'll kick a ball in the club too!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">While we were exchanging such words, Izumi was smiling, holding a bowl of rice and chewing it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After an hour or so, we ate all the meat that had been heaped on the platter. There was nothing left on the plate but grease and vegetable scraps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother and I ordered mini bibimbap at the end of the dinner, and Izumi ordered small ice cream for dessert. Then Yuriko asked,</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : bibimbab, korean rice dish</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Can I have some extra meat?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You still want to eat meat?" I said, feeling astonished, or perhaps amazed in a certain way, at Yuriko, who was being a carnivore in the very sense of the word.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko replied, "Because I like meat," and looked at Ryuu-kun. He seemed amused and laughed, saying, "Oh, sure, eat up, eat up."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks, Ryuuichi-kun,". Yuriko, looking as if she had no fatigue on her face, pressed the button to call the waiter and added a portion of kalbi, along with her third bowl of rice.</p>

<p class="calibre6">After we finished our meal, we left the restaurant. A cool night breeze was blowing, with a faint scent of plants in the humidity. The night air of early summer was pleasant to my body, which was burning from the yakiniku.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko and Izumi said to my brother, "Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You are welcome. It was more fun than going with Kenichi alone."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying that, my brother unlocked the car door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko-chan, do you want me to drive you home?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yes. Thank you. I'd be happy if you would."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat in the passenger seat and the two girls sat in the back seat, just as we had come. My brother started the engine, turned on the headlights, and pulled the car out into the driveway.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After passing through the streets in front of the station, which was bustling with lights leaking from illuminated billboards, stores, and restaurants, we entered a quiet residential area with only a few streetlights, and when we arrived in front of Yuriko's house, my brother stopped the car.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Here we are."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When my brother looked back at her, Yuriko said, "Yes," and slung the tote bag that was on her lap over her shoulder and opened the car door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you, Ryuuichi-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying that, she went down outside. Izumi opened the window and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you for today, Mori-san. See you later."</p>

<p class="calibre6">Yuriko gave a graceful smile, which was unusual for her, and waved her hand to Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It is a short drive from Yuriko's house to ours. My brother drove slowly down the narrow road and entered the car in our roofless parking lot next to the front yard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, I guess we're breaking up here. Kenichi, give the car keys back to Mom."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I got out of the car, my brother handed me the car keys with the leather key chain. Beside me, Izumi bowed her head slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuuichi-san, thank you for the food. It was fun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Let's go out together again. Do your best in studying for the test."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother replied smilingly and waved his hand lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi bowed one last time before entering the house, and I was about to follow her when my brother called out from behind me, "Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked back and my brother sat down on the seat of his moped with his helmet in his hand. Then he looked at me with a serious expression on his face and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You should pay more attention to Yuriko."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"An advice from big brother. That girl is no longer the girl you played soccer with."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I know that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We've been together since elementary school. I have spent much more time with her than my brother. I've noticed that she's changed over the years.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I hope so. But do you really understand?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I've been with her longer than you have."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Well, that's true. But there are things you can't see when you're in close proximity. Think about it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He put on the helmet in his hand. I was about to ask what he meant, but my brother turned the engine of the moped. The lights illuminated the plants in the garden, creating an intricate pattern of shadows on the white walls of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm leaving, then. I'll come back."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With these words, my brother lightly tapped me on the shoulder and walked out onto a narrow residential street. The cheesy exhaust sound of the cheap-looking moped echoed around the area, then moved away and quickly disappeared.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">A week passed, and it was the day before the first-semester final exam.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">After returning home, I cooked dinner, ate it with Izumi, and began studying for the next day's exam subjects.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It had not rained today, and it was hot and humid all day. The thermometer on the radio-controlled clock on my desk read over 30 degrees Celsius, so I turned on the air conditioner. A breeze blew with the sound of the outdoor unit running, and the curtains under the air conditioner swayed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After spending three hours reviewing the next day's three exam subjects, the date changed. Taking a break, I put down my pen and got up from my seat, thinking that I should work hard one more time. I went down the stairs, careful not to disturb my mother or Izumi with my footsteps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I went to the living room in the middle of the night, only the kitchen light was on, cutting the darkness in the living room with its white light. At the dining room table sat Izumi, dressed in her loungewear, a thin T-shirt, and soft fabric shorts, drinking water.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi. You're here?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded and replied, "I'm taking a break."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took a glass from the cupboard, too, and poured mineral water from the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Your test starts tomorrow, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi called out to my back. Yeah, I nodded, sat down across from her, and took a sip from my glass of water.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi's started today, right? ---How was it?</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked her about it, she smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I did quite well. Kenichi-kun, how about you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well. I made a lot of progress at the study session the other day."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It was fun, wasn't it? And the yakiniku afterward was delicious."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yeah, I nodded, and then I remembered the day of the study session. The first thing that came to mind was Izumi and Nagai exchanging contact information.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---So, did you hear from Nagai after that?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked, Izumi nodded without changing her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Just once. I got an email thanking me for that day."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I replied, I reached into the pocket of my shorts. The hard feel of my phone, which I had left inside, touched my fingertips.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... Izumi, can I ask you for your contact information too? Come to think of it, I didn't ask you directly, so......"&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Sure. I'll go get my cell phone, just wait a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Without the slightest awkwardness, Izumi nodded, sat up, and left the living room.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">I could hear her subtle footsteps, going up the stairs, and even the sound of her room door opening and closing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The room where I sleep and get up every day and her room is only a few meters apart. But I know nothing about how Izumi spends her daily time there. The only thing I can feel is that she is always nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I remembered my brother's advice the other day about not being able to see when you are close. I was sure he was referring to Yuriko, but I was vividly aware of the meaning of his words with regard to Izumi. Even now, I still don't know myself why I asked for Izumi's contact information, and I didn't have a clear reason for it. I just felt bothered by the fact that Nagai knew and I didn't, and I think that's why I acted on it. It's not that I wanted to know.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Huh, I exhaled, a slightly hot breath.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Soon, a firm sound fell. It was the sound of Izumi coming down the stairs. She opened the door to the living room, and in her hand was a smartphone with a red cover case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sorry to keep you waiting," Izumi said, and sat down in her seat.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">At the desk, we exchanged profile data, including each other's email addresses. Once that was done, the conversation was somewhat halted and silence descended.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For the past month, since Izumi moved in, we have seen each other every day in this place. I even feel at ease now when I spend time with her in the living room, even if we don't talk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, that's right."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I suddenly thought of a topic and spoke up, Izumi tilted her head and said, "What's up?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My brother was on a radio program the other day."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? I've never heard of it before."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. He was embarrassed to be listened to. --Here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I picked up my phone again, played a radio program on a video site that was being hosted by a cultured-looking comedian who also writes novels, and put it on my desk. My brother was on one of the longer segments of the program, so I skipped forward in time to that point by moving the seek bar.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Just as I took my finger off the screen, I heard my brother's refreshing voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Hello, I'm Sakamoto Ryuuichi, a literary critic.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Wow. It's true," Izumi smiled and raised her voice in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Sakamoto-san is currently studying philosophy at a graduate school and also publishes book reviews and critiques in magazines and other publications......,』 the host, who spoke in a high-pitched tone, introduced my brother. He did not mention our father.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother's talk was based on the idea that there are many works of literature these days that manipulate the reader, and he nimbly developed his own theory on the current state of literature and art, including subcultural terms such as character consumption and loops.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's amazing. It's totally different from what we learn at school. Kenichi-kun, can you understand what Ryuuichi-san said?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"About half of it, somehow. I've read his book reviews."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">After about ten minutes of playback, I touched the screen and stopped the video, saying, "This is about what it looks like."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You can search for Ryuu-kun's name if you want to know more," I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Understood. Thanks. It was fun," Izumi replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Somehow, I feel more motivated to study. I'm going back now."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi left the living room, her red slippers clacking against the floor. Alone, I tipped my glass and slowly drank the rest of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I took my phone and looked at her profile data that she had just sent me. I touched the URL of the SNS site written there, and found several pictures of Izumi on the page. There were people I didn't know, and Izumi had a kind of expression on her face that I didn't know.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Looking at them, I felt that she was a distant person.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">But, perhaps that distance is the true distance between Izumi and me. We have never met in 17 years, and although it is more likely that we might have spent the rest of our lives without knowing each other, our lives suddenly crossed paths one month ago.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the past month, I have become quite comfortable with her. I've never gotten to close to anyone at such a rapid pace before. However, I know nothing about where Izumi has been, with what kind of people, or how she has spent her seventeen years before coming to our house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There is a long distance between me and her under the same roof that cannot be filled anytime soon.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The chime rang.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A feeling of relief and freedom immediately began to fill the classroom as the person in the back of the room collected the exam answers, following the instructions of the teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With this, the three-day test schedule was over. I let out a sigh of relief and lightly rolled my shoulders, which had been stiffened by studying and tension.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Club activities would resume on this day. It was cloudy outside, but no rain was falling. It hadn't rained yesterday either, so the ground should be in good condition.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Let's go, Sakamoto."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai, carrying a gray enamel bag slung over his shoulder, came to my desk. I nod and quickly pack my bags.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We left the school building after the test and headed outdoors to the baggage area traditionally occupied by the soccer team. I change into my soccer shorts, take off my shirt, and change into my training wear. Then I put my feet into my spikes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The club members were already out on the field kicking the ball. Tachibana was also there, carrying a stack of red cones from the equipment bin. Yuriko was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi-san, did she say anything about how the test went?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai, who had changed into a white uniform, asked me this as he pulled out a pair of spikes from his bag. I turned my head toward Nagai. He looked the same as usual. I guessed that he had brought it up as a casual topic of conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. She said she did it well," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. I was a little concerned that I might have bothered her studies."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The feeling of jealousy that I had felt the other day, though I couldn't clearly identify it, began to smolder in my chest again. I tried to suppress it and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't think she was bothered at all. She said she enjoyed it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good, then," he said, sounding relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I looked at the ground, I saw that Tachibana had put the cone down on the ground once, perhaps because she was tired. The first-year students around her were so engrossed in playing the passing game that they did not notice Tachibana.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nagai, let's help Tachibana with the preparations."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When he looked at Tachibana, who was heavily carrying a cone by herself, he said, "Yeah," and he looked up and nodded his head. After waiting for Nagai to tie his spikes, we went out to the field and ran to Tachibana.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll help you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai took the four stacked cones from Tachibana as if to lend a hand. Tachibana looked very happy and said, "Oh, Nagai-senpai. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"The first-year guys didn't help me out. As expected of Nagai-senpai, you are very kind."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, Sakamoto was the first one who suggested it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana looked at me with a dubious look and said, "Sakamoto-senpai?" She looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you eating something strange, senpai? Maybe you've been studying too much and you're going crazy?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is it so weird that I'm the one who's being considerate?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I mean, Sakamoto-senpai was always giving off an aura of 'I'm not going to talk to anyone'. The other day, when we were on the bus for a tour, you were listening to music in your earphones while everyone else was in high spirits."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't give off that kind of aura."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai gave a small wry smile at the exchange between Tachibana and me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But Sakamoto has been getting better lately."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"With this?" Tachibana said with exaggerated surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was trying to be considerate to Tachibana and said, "I'm going to get the rest of the cones and markers from the equipment shed," and headed for the shed where the soccer team kept the balls and cones.</p>


<p class="calibre6">We went through our usual practice routine, and in a corner of the field, Yuriko was kicking a ball with Tachibana. Tachibana was kicking the ball poorly and getting excited, while Yuriko was mostly silent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">An hour or so later, when everyone was sweating in the July heat. Black rain clouds drifted in with a damp wind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Soon the rain began to fall in drops. It was a big drop of rain that looked like it was going to be a heavy downpour. We were in the middle of shooting practice, so we decided to stop our club activities immediately, put away our equipment, and return to the roofed luggage area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I gathered up the ball with a few other members of the club who were nearby, grabbed it in both hands, and ran to the equipment shed. Meanwhile, the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and thunder rumbled in the distance. "Gee!", Tachibana, who was carrying the bib, freaked out, looking like she had just blown her usual burikko attitude, and Yuriko snatched it away and said, "Akari, go back first,". "I'm sorry!" Tachibana replied and ran toward the school building.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : burikko, woman or girl who acts cute by playing innocent and helpless</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">Several boys, including myself, collected and put away the balls scattered all over the field, and Yuriko also put away the bibs and markers on the shelves. After cleaning up, the club members left the equipment shed and ran joyfully and happily in the heavy rain, which was blurring their vision. I stood at the entrance and looked up at the sky, thinking that it would be better to stay here if it was raining like this.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Covered by thick clouds, the ground is as dark as night. In addition to the sound of rain hitting the ground, there were occasional rumbles of thunder that shook my stomach. The weather forecast didn't say it would rain like this. It must be temporary. Maybe this downpour would stop soon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With that thought, I returned my gaze from the sky to the ground and noticed Yuriko standing right next to me. She was looking up at the sky too. Her hair and clothes were soaking wet from the rain. The white fabric of her clothes was tightly clinging to her shoulders, revealing the color of her skin. Furthermore, the color of her pale blue underwear also rose to the surface, along with the bulge in her chest, and I reflexively looked away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"This, maybe we better stay here for a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said that, Yuriko didn't reply, only moved her eyes to look at me. Then she stepped one step forward and grabbed the handle of the sliding door of the shed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko moved the badly-placed door noisily and forcefully, and closed it with a slam. The shed, which had no electricity, was completely dark. I could barely see Yuriko with only the faint dim light leaking through the narrow gap between the roof and the wall. She looked back, crossed her arms, and stared at me from the front.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Pressured by her unusual atmosphere, I asked her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Kenichi, you are so kind to Izumi, but so harsh with me. Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was terribly perplexed when she suddenly started talking about Izumi, as if to ask me a question. I heard a loud noise like a rumble of the earth, as if lightning had struck somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What? What do you mean, "strict"?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said in a loud voice, trying not to be drowned out by the sound of the rain echoing inside the shed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You call me 'you'. And when I eat meat, you say things that piss me off, like I'm getting fat.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : Kenichi calls Yuriko "omae", while he calls Izumi by her name</span></p><p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre6">"Because that's......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's, what? Why do you always so kind to that girl?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not like that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As if ignoring my words, Yuriko took a step forward. Then, she laid both her hands on my chest. She suddenly put her weight on me, and I almost stumbled backward.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, don't push me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Quiet, shut up."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko put more weight on me. Just as I was about to shout, "That' s enough," Yuriko straightened up and raised her face to the same position as mine.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y7qjsvz/000004.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">At that moment, the taste of rain and sweat spread in my mouth, along with a warm sensation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Our wet lips touched, and Yuriko's lukewarm breath entered my half-open mouth. Our tongues touched each other slightly. Yuriko's tongue was surprisingly soft inside my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Time stopped. Only the sound of the rain, pounding hard against the roof of the shed, continued to echo through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre6">How long had we remained in the same position? Was it a moment or was it seconds?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, with a thud, I felt a strong push on my chest. I staggered, my whole body drained, and slammed my back hard against the shelf behind me. I choked and coughed a few times, and Yuriko looked at me angrily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Because that's how it is."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she turned on her heel, untying her hair, which was tied in one knot. She opened the door and ran out under the rainy sky, which had become somewhat lighter. Her wet hair fluttered heavily, dropping drops of water like raindrops on the concrete floor.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The thunderstorm gradually subsided, but the ground was sloppy because of the heavy rain, so we soon broke up the club activities. I took off my soaking wet clothes, wiped myself off with a towel, and changed into my uniform. Then I moved away from the club members and held my knees alone, staring at the lightly falling rain on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko's touch remained on my lips and on my tongue. The softness of her body touching me came back again and again, with a fresh sensation, as if I was experiencing it right now. In contrast, my sense of reality was very weak. It was hard to breathe, as if even the air had become thinner. The current sensation and that time were mixed up so chaotically that I felt like I was losing my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey Sakamoto, are you feeling sick?"</p>

<p class="calibre6">I suddenly heard a voice, and, "Eh?" escaped my mouth as Nagai, along with several other members of the club, asked me with a worried look on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......It's nothing."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said so, "I see," they moved away from me, though they seemed to be concerned about it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After a while, the rain stopped and the sky brightened rapidly. The sky after the black clouds had gone was a ferociously red evening sky of summer. Puddles of water all over the ground reflected the light sharply, and a thin rainbow appeared in the sky above.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As the club members were leaving, I was still unable to move and kept staring up at the summer sky.</p>


<p class="calibre6">As the rainbow, which had been shining brightly while scattering the yellow setting sun around me, gradually faded, and eventually completely melted into the evening sky, I finally stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no one around anymore. Not only the soccer club members, but also the athletics club, tennis club, and other club members who play on the field had probably all gone home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I grabbed my luggage and walked to the bicycle parking lot. I looked around, but I did not see Yuriko's bicycle among the much smaller number of bicycles than in the morning. With a heavy feeling, I took off the key and rode home alone on my bicycle in the city in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I arrived home, I found Izumi's leather shoes neatly arranged and lined up at the entrance, as usual. When I saw them, for some reason, a heavy breath escaped my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took off my shoes and stuck on my own slippers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I opened the living room door, the lights were not on and there was no sign of anyone. It was the end of a long evening at the beginning of summer, and the living room seemed to be sinking into darkness, moment by moment, with the outlines of all the shadows blurred.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, I felt the presence of someone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi was sitting on a sofa positioned next to the door. However, her head was tilted back and her eyes were closed. In the silence of the evening, only the sound of her well-regulated breathing was faintly heard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---She is asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The light always leaked from her room until late these days. As I recall, her test was over today. I wondered if she felt relieved and exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was sleeping in her school uniform, so her skirt was slightly rolled up and her thighs were peeking out. Izumi's always been full of openings, but just now, for God's sake, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the blanket that was folded next to the sofa and wrapped it over her body quietly, so as not to wake her up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I exhaled deeply and slowly. Looking at Izumi sleeping peacefully, the incident with Yuriko in the dark seemed like a dream. But at the same time, the taste of her sour sweat and the soft sensation of her tongue were tremendously real, even now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I left the living room and quietly closed the door.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I went to the bathroom and took a shower head first. When I closed my eyes, the image of her drenched in the rain came to me, and it became hard to breathe.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I knew she was the opposite sex. I knew it. But never before had I felt so strongly, with my body, that she was a girl. Droplets of water dripped from my body and were sucked down the drain in a swirling stream.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got out of the bathroom, wiped myself off, and changed into loungewear. With my body softened by the shower, I went up the stairs, trying not to wake Izumi with my footsteps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As usual, the long July sun has yet to set. Deep orange light shone in through the window, filling the room and casting deep shadows on the many books lined up on the bookshelves.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The quiet early summer evening seemed to slow down the flow of time, and it seemed as if the sunset would last forever.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the window and stepped out onto the balcony. The wet city was shining. The sky was colored in gradations of every evening color, and the air was sultry and hot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Somewhere, cicadas began to chirp.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The rainy season was over, I could feel it.</p></div>
