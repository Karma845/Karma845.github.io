<h2 class="calibre5">Chapter 1 &#8211; Moving Day</h2>


<p class="calibre6">Arriving at the station where we were to meet, I walked quickly through the crowd, then leaned my back against a large pillar in front of the ticket gate, and looked at the time on the electric signboard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was 4:12 p.m., three minutes before her train arrived. Relieved that I was just in time, I put the back of my head against the pillar and let out a small breath amid the hustle and bustle of the evening station.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a month ago that my mother told me that a relative of ours was going to move into our house. Since then, I had hurriedly cleaned up the room on the second floor, which had been a storage room until yesterday, and put an unused old desk and extra futon in the closet to make it ready for people to live in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had never met her, nor did her name ring a bell. I had never had much contact with my relatives. Once when I was in elementary school, I was taken to the funeral of my grandmother's sister, whose face I did not even know.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Today, it had been raining since this morning. The sky was a heavy gray of the rainy season, and there were many droplets of water on the windowpanes. The air smelled a little fishy. The wet umbrellas and shoes of people walking in the station soaked the tiled floor.</p><p class="calibre6">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre6">As I gazed at the station at dusk, with people busily coming and going, the time display on the electric board showed 4:15 p.m. An announcement announcing the arrival of the train could be heard outside the ticket gate, and the metal clang of the train's stop rang out. Suddenly, the cell phone in my pocket shook. On the screen was an unknown number. But the timing was right: it was definitely her. Perhaps her mother had given her my number.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt my breath catch in my throat, but I couldn't ignore it. I let out a slow breath, touched the call icon, and held it to my ear.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The speakers were filled with a motley mixture of footsteps and announcements. Then, as I expected, a soft girl's voice announced her name.</p>
<p class="calibre6">『I'm Izumi. I just arrived. Um, where are you?』</p>
<p class="calibre6">When asked, I hurriedly looked around. A number of office workers and high school students in school uniforms were walking quickly past me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---I'm at the pillar in front of the ticket machine. I'm wearing jeans and a gray shirt."</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Got it. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.』</p>
<p class="calibre6">The phone hung up after the words "excuse me,". There was an electronic beep, and I pulled the phone away from my ear and tucked it into my pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked up and saw the passengers who had just gotten off the train coming through the ticket gates one after another. Of course, there was no way I could tell which one was Izumi Rina, who I would be living with from now on, but I somehow found myself staring at the flow of people.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then my eyes met those of a dark-haired girl with a small brown backpack and a red case, who had just left the ticket gate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As soon as our eyes met, her face lit up, she bowed her head and walked straight toward me. I knew from the look on her face that this was the girl I was looking for.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her medium-length hair was straight, down to her collarbone, and the top of her ears is slightly peeking out. Her relaxed cheeks and eyes were soft, and her white blouse, pale beige cardigan, and long navy blue skirt gave her a neat impression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She bowed her head in front of me and asked, "You are Sakamoto Kenichi-kun, aren't you?</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, I am."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I answered, she smiled and began to speak in a friendly manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, I had you come all the way to the station. I'll be indebted to you from now on."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My shy nature came out and I could only reply vaguely, "Hello". After my mother told me about her move, it was a strange feeling to actually see the person I had imagined from the mere sound of her name, "Izumi Rina," appear in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at the clock at the ticket gate and turned my body toward the exit of the station, saying, "It's almost time for the bus to leave,". Izumi nodded and started walking ahead of me, trailing behind me with her case in tow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We got off the escalator and went out to the station roundabout. The bus was already at the stop, doors open, waiting for passengers. The city was dark and wet from the continuous rain falling from the deep gray clouds. Outside, the sound of the rain was even louder than inside the building.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no roof over the fifty-meter distance to the bus stops. Under the concrete roof at the entrance of the station, Izumi unbuckled the shoulder strap of her backpack and pulled out a red folding umbrella from inside.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I also open the shabby plastic umbrella in one hand, and we start walking to the bus stop. The sound of the rain tapping on the umbrella and the sound of Izumi's pumps on the brick sidewalk echoed around us. On a dimly raining evening, the people walking in front of the station were all taciturn, as if shadows were walking by.</p>


<p class="calibre6">There were some vacant seats on the bus for two people. I walked to one of them and motioned to Izumi, who hurriedly followed behind me, to take a seat by the window. Perhaps noticing my signal, she bowed her head, lifted her heavy case, and carried it over the steps with her knees. Then she sat down and put her backpack on her lap.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... The rain hasn't stopped, has it? The forecast said it would stop in the evening."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said as I sat down next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, "Yes, that's right,". Izumi was looking up at the sky through the water-drop-stained window. The inside of the window was slightly fogged up, probably due to the warm air on the bus.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As we sat side by side in a space where our elbows touched each other, the air in the dusty bus was filled with a faintly sweet smell wafting from her. I wondered if it was her own scent or cologne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She sits with her hands neatly on her lap. On her left wrist, she wore a small wristwatch. Her belongings looked a little more expensive than those of an ordinary high school student. Izumi attends a well-known private all-girls school, with an integrated middle and high school. The atmosphere she was giving off earlier gave me a sense of her upbringing, which made me, a student at an ordinary public high school, feeling a little self-conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Soon the engine started, the car shuddered, and an announcement was made in an unobtrusive manner, telling the driver where the vehicle would stop. Suddenly, Izumi turned to me and asked, "How far is it from here?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"About... 20 minutes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The conversation was cut short at that, and silence fell. At the same time, the bus closed its doors and drove off into the rainy city.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi smiled and turned her head toward me for a moment as if still trying to find a clue to the conversation. I tried to find something to continue, but couldn't think of anything to say. As the silence dragged on, I could sense that an aura of awkwardness was seeping out from behind her pleasant smile, and I began to feel sorry for her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This girl is nervous, after all. It's only natural when you think about it. Even though it is a relative's house, she is going to live with someone she has never met before for a while. She will be away from her parents, and she may be feeling a bit lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Umm, Izumi said, her voice coming out with a smile that almost made me break out in a cold sweat.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How far is it from the bus stop to your house?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... About five minutes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, is that so ..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The conversation was cut off again in an instant, and Izumi casts her eyes down. I was impatiently trying to think of something to say to Izumi, and I managed to come up with an unrelated question.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you doing any club activities?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She raised her face and then gave a bright expression to my low voice, which seemed to blend in with the sound of the bus engine.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm in the badminton club. It's not a very active club, just a light workout a couple of times a week. ---What about you, Sakamoto-kun?</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I play soccer."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I replied, she sounded a little excited.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I like watching soccer. I don't really know the rules, though. I know players like Honda. ---How long have you been playing?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Since I was in elementary school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's great. So you've been doing this a long time."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She then started asking me some questions and talking about her school. Although I still felt uncomfortable talking to her, I kept on responding to her, trying not to act as if I was refusing to have a conversation with her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While we were repeating the conversation in such a way that we could gauge the distance between each other, the nearest bus stop was approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Next is our stops."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I told her so, she said, "Yes," and hit the switch with the "Get off" sign on it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The bus slows down and stops. I walked down the aisle ahead of her and looked back at Izumi, who was carrying large baggage at the exit.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll take your luggage."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The steps are narrow and slippery from the rain. I held out my hand, knowing that it would be dangerous with a heavy case in her hand. If I don't cover for my inability to speak well in places like this, I will really just be perceived as a guy with a bad attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah...... Yeah, thanks."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi looked reserved for a moment, then smiled and handed me the handle of her case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I lifted it up to see what was in it, and it was quite heavy. It was a good suggestion because it was surprisingly difficult to avoid bumping the narrow landing and the case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got off first and opened my plastic umbrella. Izumi, who came down after me, also opened a red folding umbrella, said, "Thank you," and received the case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The rain continues to fall in a quiet, rainy season-like manner, and it continues to sprinkle without seeming to stop. The bus started to drive away when the flow of traffic died down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"All we have to do now is walk straight."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi nodded and walked beside me at a distance where our umbrellas would not collide. This time, the subtle distance and the sound of the rain-filled the silence.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The streets, drenched with rainy season rain, have large puddles of water in some places. The rain was pouring down there incessantly, creating several circular crests. I looked at Izumi from the side and saw that she was a head shorter than me. Her soft, fine hair seemed to absorb moisture and have a moist weight to it.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">"Here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We stopped in front of an ordinary two-story house that had almost the same design as the surrounding houses, which I moved to when I was in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi was next to me and looked up at my house where she is going to live from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the chest-high outer gate and motioned for Izumi to come inside. She gave a small nod and stepped onto our property.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the narrow garden between the gate and the front door were hydrangeas and roses that my mother had planted. Their flowers and green leaves were wet from the raindrops.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I take the key out of my pocket and unlock the door. Amidst the sound of the pouring rain, the sound of the lock opening with a clank echoed with a strange heaviness.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I open the door and go inside. Perhaps it was because I had walked in the fishy air of the rainy season, I could feel the smell of home, which I rarely feel in my daily life. I took off my shoes, pressed the switch at the Agari kamachi and turned on the front door light.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">TN : The Agari kamachi is a kind of step to enter the living space from an entrance in the Japanese houses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"E-Excuse me&nbsp; for disturbing you..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said so and followed me into the front door. Then she opened her mouth and said, "Ah,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, I have so much stuff......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Ahead of Izumi's eyes, there were several cardboard boxes piled up by the front door. They were Izumi's packages that had arrived by courier yesterday. I thought to myself, "You don't have to apologize for that," but I replied, "No, it's okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she took off her shoes and arranged them neatly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, "Wait a minute," and headed for the bathroom near the front door to get a large towel and a cleaning rag.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Here, use this."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi took it, lightly wiped her hand that was holding the umbrella and her hair, and then used the rag to wipe the bottom of her case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi's room is on the second floor."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I shove the used towels into the laundry basket and walk up the stairs facing the front door. Izumi followed with her luggage. When we reached the second floor, we found a short hallway with three doors in a row.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The far-right is my room, and next to it is my brother's room, who has already left home. The one on the left is the spare room for Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I opened the door, she gazed gingerly inside.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After clearing out the room to empty, I just set up an old desk and chest of drawers that my brother used to use in the past, for now, and it was a bleak room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You can arrange it as you want."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said what my mother had said. Izumi went inside and looked around the room. The wooden floor, the electric light with its translucent plastic cover, the red curtains......clustered by the window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Let's carry the luggage at the entrance to the room."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I called out to Izumi's back as she looked around the room. At any rate, my role today would be complete if I carried in the eight cardboard boxes piled up in that doorway.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She replied "yes" to my voice, put her backpack and case by the wall, and followed me.</p>

<p class="calibre6">We went downstairs and together we carried the cardboard boxes one by one to Izumi's room. Each cardboard box was labeled 『books』 or 『clothes』 in an oil-based pen, and one of them was strangely lightweight and labeled 『underwear』. When I noticed the label, my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I unconsciously looked up and saw Izumi holding the other side. She casts her eyes down slightly. Sweat began to form on my forehead due to the awkwardness of the situation, but I thought it would be deliberate to pull my hand away now, so I pretended not to notice anything. I walked up the stairs, facing Izumi, and put it down in her room as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After about ten minutes of carrying all the cardboard boxes, we both let out a big breath. I asked Izumi, "This is all of them, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi bowed her head in a small gesture, brushing her bangs out of her eyes to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With this, the moving process was over for the time being. From now on, she will live in this room for the next six months. Thinking of this, I felt as if I had no place to stay even though it was my house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"....... Okay, I'm going back to my room..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah...."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Just as I was about to turn around, I heard the front door open, followed by the rustling of a plastic bag.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, are you home already?" my mother's voice echoed from downstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked at Izumi and said, "I think my parents are back,". She nodded her head. I knew that, by the way things were going, I would have to take Izumi downstairs with me, so we went down the stairs together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the door to the living room and kitchen. There is a living room with a three-person brown sofa, a wooden rosette table, and an LCD TV, and a dining room and kitchen. In front of the kitchen was a table for four, and my mother wearing a cream-colored cardigan stood beside it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I went to pick her up," I said to my mother's back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother looked back at me and said, "Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother was supposed to pick Izumi up by car, but last night, a neighbor suddenly asked my mother to substitute for her at a neighborhood association meeting, so I went to the station to pick her up instead. Judging from the shopping bags now on the table, she probably went shopping after she finished her errands.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hello, aunty. I'll be indebted to you from now on."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi came out from behind me and bowed politely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Welcome, Rina-chan. It's been raining, and you must be tired after your trip."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I'm fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi shook her head and chuckled amiably.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, I had a sudden appointment and couldn't pick you up.---I'm sure this guy was not very sociable."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother, while taking a carton of milk out of the shopping bag and putting it in the refrigerator, looked at me and said with a wry smile. My mother had already met Izumi several times.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No. I had my luggage carried. It was very helpful."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so? Then that's good.---Kenichi may be unfriendly, but he's not angry. He's just not very good at talking. So don't worry if he's a bit brusque."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi is smiling and listening to my mother. My mother had a sociable personality, and Izumi seemed to be much more open than she was to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Um, I'm going back to my room."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said so and headed for my room. I thought that since they were both women, Izumi would be more comfortable talking with my mother alone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, yes. Thanks for your help."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Just before leaving the living room, my mother said so to me, and Izumi gave a small bow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The house was filled with the sound of rain hitting the roof and the bouncy conversation between Izumi and my mother. I went up the stairs, walked down the short corridor on the second floor, and saw Izumi's room with the door open.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the dark brown wooden floor, the cardboard boxes we had just carried were lined up, and in the corner lay the brown backpack and red case she had brought with her.</p><p class="calibre6"></p>

<p style= "text-align: center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p>

<p class="calibre6">I lay down on my bed and read a book in the dimness of a rainy day. At this time of year, it is still bright outside even when it is nearly 6:00 p.m. Even on a day like today, when the sky is covered with gray clouds, if the curtains are open, there is a vague brightness.</p>
<p class="calibre6">About 30 minutes after I returned to my room, there was a light knock at my door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got up, tucking a bookmark into my book. The tapping sound was a bit new to me because my mother always called out loudly when she needed me, without knocking.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said so and turned to the door and heard Izumi's voice saying, "It's dinner time, come downstairs."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"OK, I'm going now."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got up and opened the door. Then I went down the stairs with Izumi who came to call me and entered the living room. On the table were prepared foods that my mother had bought. The menu was much more luxurious than usual. My mother likes to make things lively, so she must have been very excited about Izumi's arrival.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and my mother sat facing each other at the table for four, and I sat beside her. The TV was playing the evening news. A fresh-looking male announcer with waxed hair was reading the news, but I could hardly hear his voice because it was drowned out by the conversation between my mother and Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Tomoko is really sudden, isn't she? I can't believe she's going to Brazil. She's always like that. Even when we were a student, all of our friends were so busy being pushed around by her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My mother is a workaholic."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That said, I wonder if I would leave my high schooler child and go to the other side of the world normally."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Apparently, it was a huge business opportunity."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"New coffee beans, huh? I wonder if it is really profitable to import them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My mother says it tastes very good."</p>
<p class="calibre6">They exchanged such conversations at a high tempo. My mother seemed to get along well with Izumi, perhaps because she was a relative and the daughter of her best friend. They talked about Izumi's parents and her school and kept getting into a lively conversation throughout the meal.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was quietly eating my meal besides them, listening to their conversation from right to left.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After finishing my meal in about 10 minutes, I poured myself a cup of barley tea and was drinking it when I felt a vibration in my pocket. When I took out my phone and saw an incoming message on SNS. It was from my brother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">《I'm sure you've already finished with that girl's moving, right? Come over to my place and tell me all about it.》</p>
<p class="calibre6">As usual, the message was written in a crude Japanese that one would not expect from a graduate student in the humanities. And although I thought to myself, "I wish you could just come over here yourself," I quickly responded, 《Okay. I'll be there later,》.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat up and washed my own dishes in the sink. Then I was about to leave the living room to go back to my room, thinking I would just take my wallet. Then,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, are you going somewhere?" my mother asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuu-kun's place. I got called out for something."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I stopped and answered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not for something strange, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother said with a wary look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not like that. 'Come and play with me, you're not busy, are you?' he said."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother let out a deliberate sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Tell Ryuuichi that I've already accepted his offer to go to graduate school and that he should come home once in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi listened to our conversation with a puzzled expression on her face. Then, perhaps sensing that I was about to leave the house, she stopped me and said, "Kenichi-kun,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">What? I reacted naturally, and then, after a pause, I felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---Kenichi-kun?.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I was puzzled by the fact that she called me by my name,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, um, there's aunty, too, and I thought it would be weird to call you Sakamoto-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said as if in excuse. I said, "Yeah, well, it's true," and throw appropriate words.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you for today. You helped me a lot."</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/SsHMwg2/000013.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">Sitting in her chair, bowing as if folding her upper body, Izumi said. Even though she was a relative, being called by name by a girl I had almost never met before made me feel embarrassed or perhaps strangely fidgety.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, it's nothing, I didn't have anything more to do today anyway..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying this, I gave a small nod back to Izumi. Izumi kept her lips closed and laughed, lifting her cheek softly.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">The rain had stopped before I knew it. The sky was still entirely covered with clouds, but there were some gaps in the clouds, through which I could see a portion of the white moon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The dark wet asphalt reflected the light of the streetlamps as if it had been sprinkled with glass powder. There are not many cars on this residential street, and it is very quiet at night.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother's apartment in the same town is about 15 minutes away by bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother is a graduate student in the humanities, and he started living alone while working part-time during his third year of college. The university was in Tokyo, it seems that he could have lived near there, but he rented a room in this Tokyo suburb because of the rent and because he felt at home in this characterless place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In one of the few districts in the town, where there aren't many street lights, there was a two-story, long rectangular apartment where my brother lived. In front of the building, there is a small parking lot with gravel, and a large number of leaflets are stuck in the mailbox of an empty room. The lights attached to the building and the white-painted walls were yellowed, and the metal parts were rusted reddish brown and not very clean.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got off my bike, parked it in the corner of the gravel parking lot, and stood in front of my brother's room on the leftmost side of the first floor. A piece of tape with the name 『Sakamoto』 printed on it was taped to an aluminum plate with a number of scuffed lines next to the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I pressed the intercom, I could hear the muffled sound of a person moving behind the poorly soundproofed door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yo. I've been waiting for you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The door opened and my brother, with long hair, dyed dark brown, wearing dark jeans and a slim, open-chested, three-quarter sleeve shirt, appeared with a wry smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In contrast to the shabby exterior and the flamboyance of the residents,&nbsp; my brother's room was neat and tidy, and the furniture was uniformly black and brown. The large bookcase was filled with books, which blended naturally with the simple interior and gave the room an intellectual impression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"If you're curious about Izumi, why don't you just come yourself?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat down on the sofa in my brother's room, saying what I had just thought, and in the small 1DK room, this sofa and my brother's desk chair were the only places where I could sit calmly. On the desk was a desktop computer, a stack of some books, and a stack of A4-size papers of printed materials and papers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother sat in his desk chair, spun his chair around to face me, and crossed his legs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You know, it's hard to talk about someone when mom and the person in question are around. ---So, what was this Rina-chan like?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">He asks me with a flirtatious smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This man had always been extremely popular. Moreover, he is not only popular with the ladies, but he is also the type to go out on his own, and he has been in relationships with several people. I can't believe that we are siblings because of his impressive communication skills. I think that all the qualities in that area were taken by my brother. Also, he is very smart. When I had an excellent person like this person as my brother, I often wondered what I was.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Just a normal girl."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I answered shortly, just as I felt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So she's cute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I think I didn't say anything like that, and I tilted my head in doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Normal is basically a pretty good impression, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">At my brother's words, I angled my tilted head even deeper and pictured Izumi's face, which I had just learned. She was not extremely pretty, but her bearing and clothes were girlish, and she had a gentle manner. I don't think she is not cute at all.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, do you know what a good-looking man or a beautiful woman looks like?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother began to talk as if he was going to tell me something interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Like big eyes or a small face?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I replied, "No," my brother shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I mean that they don't have any features. I heard it's technically called 'averageness' of the face. A person's face is often rated as attractive if it is close to the average face of the group to which he or she belongs."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... So?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"If you call that girl normal, it means that subconsciously you likely got a good impression of her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......it's sound like a sophism."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, my brother laughed dryly, as if he had meant it as a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It was written in a book I read recently. I've been thinking for a while now that if I could connect this with the recent character theory, I'll be able to write interesting criticisms. I think it could be related to the "Stamp" and so on. What do you think?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I think he is still a serious person, as he immediately went to that side of the conversation. As if he had just thought of something, he got up from his seat and headed for the cramped kitchen, which is located near the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You want something to drink?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah," I replied and he came back with two glasses of Coke and handed me one of them. I said, "Thank you," and took a sip.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, I'm glad you didn't get a bad impression of her. Since it's you, I thought you'd have a lot of trouble with a girl your age."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think it must be more difficult for her than for me because of the change in environment and her school has gotten much further away."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Where does she go?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Tomigaoka Girls."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Heh. She's going to a good place, isn't she? There is a girl from there in my seminar. Indeed, it's a bit far from here. It must be tough since you have to be up early in the morning every day."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's right," I nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After some small talk, my brother put his glass on the desk and tapped both knees with his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi," he said in formal tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked up and suddenly there was silence, and then I heard the sound of the soda popping in the glass in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm warning you, don't put your hand on her. If that's the case, I'll introduce you to another pretty girl. She's probably older than you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As expected, it will be like this, I thought</p>
<p class="calibre6">I quickly looked at my brother. He had a very serious expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I would never do that. I'm not you, Ryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, my brother also lost his good looks and said, "Hey, what do you mean by that?" in a joking, teasing tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Judging from the way he was so formal earlier, I think he probably wanted to say this more than he wanted to ask about Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But, well, even if you don't want to talk about that, if you ever feel uncomfortable, you can always come over here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mhm. Understood."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, the conversation came to a halt. I glanced at the wall clock and saw that it was almost ten o'clock. In the gap in the conversation, I slipped in a message from my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Oh, by the way, Mom said she's allowed you to go to school, so you should show up once in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother raised his face, the shadow of a smile still on it, and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I'd like to meet that relative of ours, so I'll come out in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Last year, when my brother was a senior in college, he had one big fight at home when he told mom about his plans for higher education and she objected. I was quite surprised at that time that my brother, who was so good at dealing with things but flashy, got really angry. But that's how strong he must have felt about his career path. He seems to be playing around, but he has been saving his part-time job money since he was an undergraduate student to prepare for higher education, and has even obtained a scholarship for graduate students that he does not have to pay back, so he seems to be in good financial shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">It has been a year since the fight, but I wonder if my brother still has some resentment toward mom. Even after he started living alone, he often came to our house to visit, but after that day, his visits to our house became much less frequent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you still angry at mom for being against you that time?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I boldly asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, it's not like that. I know that mom's objection was for my sake. It's only natural, considering our father's situation... Somehow, I'm just embarrassed."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother replied with a slight smile as if it was nothing. That being said, there was no way for me to ask anything more. I see, I said. Then I drank the last of my remaining Coke and sat up from the couch.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'd better get back."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah," My brother nodded and sat up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Say hello to them for me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, I understand."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I put on my shoes in the dimly lit foyer, opened the heavy, poorly-furnished apartment door, and stepped outside.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">Instantly, I smelled the damp air after the rain. The gravel parking lot was covered with muddy puddles in places.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The residential area was even quieter at this late hour of the night. From somewhere came the breezy sound of early summer winged insects.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></div></div>

<p class="calibre6">I parked my bike in the front yard and opened the door to my house. I muttered, "I'm home," and tossed my bike key into the key case at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was taking off my shoes, I heard the door open with clang as I thought about how I would go to bed early because I have club activities in the morning tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I looked up and saw Izumi, dressed in a thin T-shirt and shorts that seemed only to cover her butt, coming out of the door of the dressing room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Our eyes meet. She stops moving with a snap, looking at me with round eyes like a startled rabbit.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the one in the middle</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, w-welcome home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said awkwardly, like a poorly made robot from an old comic book.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I-I'm home..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and I remained rigid with each other for a few seconds. Her skin was glistening, her hair was freshly dried, and steam was rising from her hair. She was wearing only a T-shirt, and the bulge around her chest looked rather vivid. The neck of her shirt was a little loose, and the skin around her collarbone peeked out in white.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"O-Oh, um..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said in a gasp and in a slurred voice,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"U-Um, aunty told me to take a shower first......Um, i-it was nice hot water..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I-Is that so. That's good to know..."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">Silence.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A hint of awkwardness oozed from each other. I was in a hurry to find out what to do about the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, are you back?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother's voice came from the living room. It brought me back to my senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm back! I'm going to my room!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Well then, take your time! I said to Izumi, and I walked up the stairs with a thud, entered my room, closed the door behind me, and let out a deep breath. What do you mean, "take your time"? Am I an employee of an inn or what?</p>

<p class="calibre6">I walked quietly to the bed and sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The room was quiet and I could even hear my own heartbeat. My heart beats faster, even if only for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If it is just normal shorts, it probably does not bother me so much. In the summer, there are many girls in school who wear a revealing skirt, and I also see girls in rhythmic gymnastics clubs and swimming clubs wearing revealing outfits. If you open the Internet, you will find an abundance of erotic images, and that level of stimulation is nothing nowadays.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But that vividness is dangerous. I mean, it was the first time I had ever seen a girl up close and personal after taking a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I wondered if she was upset, I thought. I tried not to be concerned about it, but the image of Izumi from earlier came back to me vaguely.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The realization that I now had a new roommate, someone my own age, something I hadn't felt much of before, became a reality when I saw Izumi's defenseless figure earlier.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre6">

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The next day, the sky was again covered with the gray clouds of the rainy season.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">The rain that had fallen all day the day before had not yet dried up by morning, and the soil on the ground, which had absorbed water, was black.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I did not sleep well last night. Even though I turned off the light and closed my eyes, the thought of Izumi sleeping nearby made me feel restless. The quietness of the house late at night bothered me, and in the midnight darkness, I felt as if I could feel Izumi's presence on the same floor through the walls.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was tired from lack of sleep, and my feet were muddy after the rain, so today's club activities were tougher than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre6">During break time, as I was staggering toward the luggage area, wiping sweat from my sleeve, someone bumped into me lightly from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I stumbled down and turned around to see the manager, Mori Yuriko. Her lightly wavy hair was tied up into a ponytail, and she was wearing the same blue pants and soccer socks that were common to all club members, with a white short-sleeved outfit over them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What is it, Yuriko? What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who had succeeded in catching me off guard, smiled a deliberate smile, paced me, and said, "You're even less enthusiastic than usual today," with her hands lightly folded behind her back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not like that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"In the shooting practice, most of your shots didn't hit the target. Even if the ground was wet, that was terrible."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said as she walked beside me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Somehow, I'm not feeling well. I haven't been sleeping well."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was nearing noon, the temperature was rising, and the wet field was getting much hotter and humid. A ball was lying at my feet. I exhaled once, focused on my form, and kicked it into the goal about 20 meters away. The ball, aimed at the top corner of the goal, curled gently and fell, then hit the bar, creating a popping sound on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I saw the shot that was hated by the goal and moaned lightly while clicking my tongue, Yuriko giggled, saying, "Looks like today you didn't score at all till the end."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is something bothering you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My heart skipped a beat when I recalled Izumi's tense face after taking a bath on her face as she looked into my face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Why do you think so?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied, trying to look nonchalant. But Yuriko's face turned doubtful.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, because you said you didn't get enough sleep. Normally, you would think something was wrong."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Nothing in particular."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thought for a moment about telling her that a relative of mine had moved in, and then these words came out. Yuriko must have guessed what was going on, because she turned her head toward me and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's with the pause? Something fishy."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said again in a teasing tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I am not good at hiding things. Yuriko, in particular, has a good instinct and has known me for a long time. If I show even the slightest hint of weakness, she will immediately know that I am hiding something from her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Tell me, Onee-san will give you a consultation."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm fine. There's nothing wrong."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, perhaps enjoying herself, pursued the matter in a half-joking, insistent manner. Then,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-senpai~ I brought this from the club room. What should I do with it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana Akari, the first-year manager, came shouting from the bench at the side of the pitch, carrying a bag of bibs. Tachibana was also wearing blue club pants, a gym uniform with her name on the chest, and her shoulder-length hair tied up in two.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you, Akari, leave it there. I'll hand them out before the game!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko gave her instructions, "Okay!" Tachibana replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It can't be helped. I'll let you go for now. It's okay to worry, but don't hurt yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre6">After saying this, Yuriko ran toward the bench where Tachibana was standing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After seeing her back off, I returned to the luggage area where the other club members were, drank a sweet sports drink from a plastic bottle, and wiped the sweat off my face with a towel.</p>


<p class="calibre6">After all the members had completed the entire practice menu, we all tidied up the field, and the club activities ended when the advisor and English teacher, Nakata-sensei, gathered all the members and gave a dismissal speech.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The twenty or so members of the club were leaving the field in droves. I was heading to the luggage area, chatting with Nagai, who was in the same class as me. Then Yuriko, who was walking a little further away, came up to us.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, Nagai. Has Kenichi asked you for any advice?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? What's that?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai replied with a puzzled look on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi seems to be having some trouble. I thought Nagai would be the only person in this club that Kenichi could talk to about something, so I thought you might know something about it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, "What do you mean by that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko replied with a twinge, "Because there is no one else in this club that Kenichi gets along with," Nagai laughed at Yuriko's words.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, that's not true."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You're very kind, Nagai. If you follow up so much, it won't be good for this guy who has a communication problem."</p>
<p class="calibre6">""That's terrible,"" We were so shocked at the way she said it that my voice and Nagai's voice overlapped.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Tachibana came from the side and took Yuriko's arm, incidentally taking away the flow of the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Senpai, do you have time after this today?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm. What is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, it's been a while since we've had tea. Oh, how about you, Nagai-senpai and Sakamoto-senpai? Would you like to have tea with us?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana took Yuriko's arm and turned her head to us and asked us a question.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I shook my head and said, "No, thanks," Nagai continued, "I'll pass, too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When we both refused, Tachibana mockingly puffed out her cheeks, saying, "Mooo, even though I went to the trouble of asking you out," Yuriko, a realist, stared at such a sweet gesture like an anime character with cold eyes. Yuriko had previously described Tachibana as a calculating girl. However, the relationship between the two is not bad. She works hard as a manager, and Yuriko takes good care of her. Tachibana also seemed to adore Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okey, let's go by the Irisawa Mall after a while."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Yuriko answered her while placing her hand on Tachibana's shoulder, Tachibana loosened her cheeks, which had been puffed up with a "moo", and said cheerfully, "Yeay!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, we returned to the luggage area near the morning assembly table, and Yuriko and Tachibana went back to the classroom. The soccer club members change outside for club activities on their days off, while the girls change in the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The luggage area was filled with the sticky-sweet smell of antiperspirant spray being sprayed on the bodies of naked men in their upper bodies. We, too, took off our clothes, wiped ourselves off, and changed into our uniforms.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I walked to the bicycle parking lot, greeting Nagai and the other club members, I saw Yuriko and Tachibana coming out of the entrance. Both of them were dressed in their summer uniforms of navy blue skirts, blouses, and purple ribbons. Yuriko was wearing short sleeves and Tachibana was wearing long sleeves rolled up to her elbows.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, who commutes to school by bicycle like me, walked to the bicycle parking lot. As we were unlocking our bicycles under the tin-roofed parking lot, Yuriko called out, "Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I raised my gaze. Yuriko had inserted a key with a cat keyring into the keyhole of her bicycle. Then she suddenly turned her head toward me and gave me a serious look.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"If you don't want to tell me, I won't force you. But, if you have a problem, you can talk to me about it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I shook my head vaguely, feeling sorry for making her feel uncomfortable, and at the same time feeling the trouble of telling her about living with Izumi right here and now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really, I'm fine. It's not like I'm in any trouble."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko's bicycle key unlocks with a light thud.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I hope so. Well, I'll see you tomorrow at school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yeah, I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She shoved her bag in the front basket, pushed her bicycle, and walked toward Tachibana, who was waiting for her on the paved road connecting the school gate and the entrance to the school. Her slightly tanned legs, navy blue high socks, and black loafers, which stretched out from her above-the-knee skirt, walked on the fresh asphalt and slowly moved away from me.&nbsp;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></div></div>

<p class="calibre6">I went home, took a shower, ate lunch with my mother and Izumi, who was still unpacking from yesterday, and then went to my room to lie down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My legs felt a little tired, probably from running around on the muddy ground. My thighs, calves, and soles of my feet were hot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Slumbering in exhaustion in the dimness of the rainy season's patchy weather, I was dozing off for a while when I heard a noise from outside my room. Then, "Kenichi," my mother called through the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?" I replied, rousing my sleepy body from the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"We're going shopping now, so you're coming with us too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"We're going to buy Rina-chan's daily necessities, but it might be a lot of luggage. Help me carry it. You can buy your favorite food, too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"... Okay. I'll be there. I'll be ready in a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got dressed, grabbed my wallet and cell phone, and went downstairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I entered the living room, I found my mother sitting on the sofa and Izumi in a chair at the dining table. Izumi was wearing a red plaid short-sleeved shirt and a long navy blue skirt that she had also worn yesterday. A brown leather pouch rested on her lap.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Finally. Shall we go then?" said my mother, and Izumi bowed to me with a smile on her face.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. You must be tired from club activities."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I'm fine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied so while returning a bow to Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So, where are we going?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I questioned my mother's back as she slung her bag over her shoulder, she replied, "Irisawa Mall."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Seriously, I thought. The remnants of my afternoon sleep had blown away. That's where Yuriko and Tachibana had said they were going to play earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's where you can get everything you need."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I responded, I looked at the clock hanging on the wall in the living room. It had been nearly three hours since club activities had ended.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---I guessed that they would be home by now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With that in mind, I left the house with my mother and Izumi and got into the car.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Fifteen minutes later, we arrived at a large three-story shopping center that sold everything from furniture to groceries.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We first headed upstairs to the interior design store. Izumi was going to buy pillows and cushions here first. I learned from our conversation on the way that Izumi's mother had given her enough money for her immediate needs, and that she also gave my mother a monthly allowance for Izumi's living expenses.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Already in my basket were a low rebound pillow, a red and white checkered pillowcase, a red bedsheet, and a desk clock in the shape of a cat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and my mother were walking slowly through the store, looking at the items as if they were friends. I stood one step behind them, hanging a plastic basket, and waited for Izumi and my mother to select their items.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a fan set up in the store in mid-June, and environmental sounds mixed with the chirping of cicadas and wind chimes were also playing. Products for the coming summer season were on display everywhere in a summery atmosphere, such as toweling beds that provide a cool and refreshing feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After a few minutes of agonizing over cushions of various colors and shapes on display, Izumi chose a red round cushion---Izumi apparently likes red things---and we left the interior design store.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi. Please."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With that, my mother handed me a plastic bag filled with cushions and other things from the store. It was bulky and a little hard to carry, but it wasn't that heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, Kenichi-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi apologized in a timid manner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It's okay, I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm here for this."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, that's right. Don't worry about it. It's good for Kenichi's muscle training."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother added, and Izumi smiled as if she were troubled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We then moved to the floor where food and household goods were sold, and Izumi put the laundry net and air freshener into a plastic basket that she carried herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was sort of following my mother and Izumi with my large luggage, but when it looked like we were about to enter the sanitary napkin section, I indeed felt awkward and stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Um. I'm going to leave this in the car," I said to them as I walked ahead, borrowed the car keys from my mother, and casually left the place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I hoped she would understand, but my mother, handing me the keys, looked doubtful about my sudden offer. Maybe she thought it was nothing, but I knew it would be too awkward to walk in there with those two.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Leaving the sales floor, I took the down escalator to the underground parking lot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The background music, which had been drowned out by the noise in the store, was clearly audible in the relatively quiet underground parking lot. I walked slowly to my car, unlocked it, and placed a large shopping bag in the back seat.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was hot and humid in the non-air-conditioned underground parking lot, and a bead of sweat trickled down my neck.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I exhaled heavily. Cars passed intermittently in the fluorescent-lit basement, and a child who almost ran out of the car was being warned by a parent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After I dropped my stuff off, I locked my car and went back inside the store. The sweat I had worked up during the short time I was in the basement cooled my skin in the air-conditioned interior.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The ground floor also contains a food court and café. The area is separated by glass, and I can see some of it from where I am now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If Yuriko and Tachibana were there, it would probably be around here, so I casually looked at the food court on Sunday afternoon, mixed with the flow of a large number of shoppers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">--I looked casually in the direction of the food court and saw a familiar figure in a uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre6">No way, I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It has been three hours since club activities had ended. What on earth do these girls have to talk about? Yuriko and Tachibana were sitting side by side at the counter of the donut store, talking about something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Next to Tachibana, who is busily moving her mouth toward Yuriko while gesturing with her hands, Yuriko is drinking something through a straw, nodding her head occasionally or shaking her head in a small way with an absentminded expression as if she is taking it in stride.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was staring at them, Yuriko suddenly looked up and turned her eyes toward me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Our eyes met. She opened her mouth with a small 'ah' and then raised her hand. And then,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, what's wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Suddenly, a voice called out to me from behind. I turned around and saw Izumi and my mother there, holding a shopping bag.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, no, it's just someone I know..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied with a stutter.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so? Do you want to go say hi?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, no. I just accidentally saw her---"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I glanced at Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko was staring at us. My mother and Yuriko knew each other. If it had been just me and my mother here, it would not have seemed unnatural. But,</p>
<p class="calibre6">---Who is that girl?</p>
<p class="calibre6">That's what Yuriko's gaze said as she looked at Izumi suspiciously while going through Tachibana who was talking beside her.</p><div class="separator">

<p class="calibre6">"Hey Kenichi," my mother spoke up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I tried to shrug off Yuriko's attention and said, "What?" I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I just got a call from someone at work asking me to have dinner with <i class="calibre9">him</i>. I'm sorry, but could you and Rina buy dinner here and take a taxi home? I'll drive from here to <i class="calibre9">his</i> place."</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Tln : I don't know if it's 'he' or 'she', so I just go with 'he' right now</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Uh, yeah, okay."</p>

<p class="calibre6">Even as I replied, I kept feeling Yuriko's gaze on me from behind my mother, about 20 meters away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, Rina-chan, for seeming to throw you out so suddenly. I'll take your luggage home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother said so and received the luggage from Izumi, and Izumi bowed, saying "I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As she handed me our dinner and taxi money and walked toward the escalators leading to the underground parking lot, Izumi thanked my mother for bringing her there, "Thank you for bringing me, Aunty," she said, to which my mother responded by raising one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As my mother disappeared into the crowd, Izumi suspiciously urged me, who was standing still, saying, "Let's go, Kenichi-kun,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded and we started walking together. I glanced back one last time and saw Yuriko still staring at me suspiciously.</p>
