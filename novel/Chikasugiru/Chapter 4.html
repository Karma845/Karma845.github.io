<h2 class="calibre5">Chapter 4 - Inside her room</h2><span><a name="more" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre"></a></span>


<p class="calibre6">On this day, a few days after the practice match, I came home from school, and a short while later the intercom rang. I went down from my room to the living room on the first floor and looked at the monitor to see my brother, a flashy and intellectual guy, wearing jeans, a black polo shirt, and a silver bangle on his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened the door and let my brother in, remembering that he had said something about "Coming to visit us once in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Where's Rina-chan?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother asked me as he entered the living room. I replied, " She' s not home yet," and he looked disappointed, so I guessed that his main purpose today was to see Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother was holding a plastic bag in his hand. When I asked him, "What's that?" he replied, "Foodstuffs."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I haven't cooked for you in a while. I picked out some expensive ingredients for you, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The plastic bag my brother placed on the table contained pasta and canned tomatoes. He had worked part-time at an Italian restaurant when he was an undergraduate student, and Italian cooking seemed to be his forte.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother washed his hands and immediately started making salad and tomato sauce in the kitchen. The sound of moving knives and frying minced meat echoed through the living room. After a while, when all that was left to do was boil the pasta, Izumi still hadn't come home, so we sat on the sofa and started playing soccer games on TV to kill time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother, like me, played soccer under my dad's influence. He wasn't that good at playing in real life, but he continued to play in the club until his senior year of high school and still played futsal for fun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, just after nine o'clock, I heard the front door open with a clank. There was no sound of a car, so it was probably Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Sure enough, from the front door, I heard Izumi's now-familiar, slightly tired voice saying, "I'm home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Following the sound of slippers, the living room door opened. Izumi, dressed in her school uniform, a cream-colored vest, and a red checked skirt on a navy blue background, walks into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked at me and my brother sitting on the sofa, opened her mouth for an, "Ah," and stiffened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother stopped his hands and grinned at her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nice to meet you. I'm Ryuuichi, Kenichi's older brother."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When he introduced himself, Izumi bowed her head, though she seemed a little stiff.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nice to meet you, I'm Izumi Rina. I've heard a lot about you from Kenichi-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">While smiling and conversing with Izumi, my brother gave me a sidelong glance and said in a teasing whisper, "Kenichi-kun, isn't it?". I ignore him, as I find it annoying that he seems to be thinking something evil.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Rina-chan, you're going to have dinner, right? I'm cooking today. Wait here for a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes, I thought something smelled good. What are you making?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Bolognese and Caesar salad. I make my own pasta sauce. You can count on it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I expected, my brother has this amazing communication skills. Izumi, who had been nervous when they first met, had already softened her expression after exchanging a few words. As I sat on the sofa, I watched my brother in the kitchen showing her a dish he was about to make, and Izumi's back in her school uniform. Seeing my brother and Izumi side by side, I somehow felt something unpleasant growing deep in my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While I still call her "Izumi", Ryuu-kun calls her "Rina-chan" from the first shot. Something about that doesn't sit well with me either.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---Could it be jealousy? I thought to myself, That's ridiculous, and hastily dismissed the thought myself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was trying to calm the faint buzzing in my heart, I heard my brother's frivolous voice in my ear.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, Rina-chan, can you try calling me 'Onii-chan'"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"E-Ehh!"</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tstKM9w/000009.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">What are you talking about all of a sudden, you flashy guy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi was also surprised and put her hand on her face, looking troubled. If Yuriko saw this gesture, she would say "burikko" or something like that. But in Izumi's case, unlike Tachibana, I don't think she is aiming for something, but probably just naturally like this.</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : Burikko, a woman or girl who acts cute by playing innocent and helpless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi, just ignore him. This guy can tell jokes like that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I turned to Izumi, who was in trouble and said that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, h-he's joking?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said, still flustered, as she looked repeatedly toward me and my brother. If he really meant it, it would be very scary, I replied to Izumi inwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother smiled at that, apologizing, sorry sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I didn't mean to trouble you. I haven't had any younger girls close to me, and I was interested in that kind of play for once."</p>
<p class="calibre6">P-Pure? said Izumi, tilting her head in confusion as she said it in her mouth. When he behaves and says things like this, it makes me want to destroy the respect I have for my excellent brother. If the brain and the lower half of the body are separate, I think Ryuu-kun is really an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuu-kun, don't tell Izumi those kinds of things."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, staring at my brother in disgust, and Izumi smiled in a bewildered way, "Aaha......".</p>
<p class="calibre6">"U-Umm, I've been doing club activities today, and I'm sweating....... Can I go change my clothes?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, sure. I'll wait for you. I'm sorry for teasing you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi replied, "No," with a reassuring smile, and left the living room as if to escape from the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With a thud, the living room door closed and silence descended. Now, I said, throwing a voice at my brother's back as he turned to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi is a serious girl, so you shouldn't tease her too much."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, when I see a girl like that, it makes me want to tease her. Her reactions are so cute, you know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He lit the stove and said in a happy tone of voice again. I buried my back deep in the sofa, saying to myself, "This is not good."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The sound of boiling water echoed through the living room. My brother put a bunch of pasta in the pot. After a few minutes, the warm, somewhat sweet smell of boiling pasta wafted into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi, dressed in her loungewear and slightly emitting a soapy scent, saw it and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Wow. It looks delicious."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Right? Let's eat now. Kenichi, take a seat."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat down alongside Izumi, and my brother sat across from me at the seat where our mother usually sat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother's food was still good, as he was so confident. Izumi also said how delicious it was, and he smiled and said, "Thank you very much,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother had been talking with Izumi for a while after he started eating, and when he ran out of conversation, he asked, "Is mom coming home late these days?" He asked in a casual tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's usually around ten o'clock. Though it is often past twelve these days."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He replied, pouring water into his cup and taking a sip.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I guess she's busy at work."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I guess so. But she seems to be enjoying life. She never complains, and she never looks tired. She also seems to be enjoying herself when she talks with Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I noticed after the conversation was over that my flashy brother, who always had a frivolous smile on his face, had until just now kept a straight face when he was talking about our mother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had been replying in a casual manner, but then I realized what had happened and suddenly turned my attention back to his face again. But now he was already smiling at Izumi and asking her if she had any hobbies, talking in a lighthearted tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After dinner, we cleaned up the dishes, wrapped my mother's portion in plastic wrap, and then resumed our game while drinking barley tea.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, you were playing a game?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said so as my brother and I sat side by side on the sofa and picked up the controllers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Soccer game. Do you want to try it, Rina-chan?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When my brother suggested it, Izumi said excitedly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I've never played a video game before."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee. That's unusual. Is your family strict?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When my brother asked, Izumi shook her head briskly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's not like that, but I wasn't really interested in it. I've played puzzle games on my cell phone for a little while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm," said my brother, operating the controller and returning it to the team select screen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, Rina-chan and I are going to play. Kenichi, teach Rina-chan how to operate the controller."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay," I replied, handing Izumi the controller. My brother sat down on the floor so that Izumi could sit on the sofa, and Izumi and I sat side by side on the sofa.</p>

<p class="calibre6">I gave a simple tutorial on how to operate it, and Izumi listened to it with an "uh-huh.".</p>
<p class="calibre6">I chose a strong team for her, and decided on a formation, trying to gather players who were in good condition. And the game that began was still a complete recreation play for Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Wow, Rina-chan, you're good!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My brother was completely intent on keeping the defender away from going to the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A single path is formed toward the goal, and one player dribbles through a long-distance that even Maradona would be amazed at.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, ah, Kenichi, which button is to shoot?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">A player operated by Izumi stopped suddenly in the penalty area as she asked me in a hasty tone. Izumi's voice tickled my ears as she sat right next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The opposing players, who were moving automatically, were gathering around the player who had the ball, but my brother, who was controlling them all, was doing his best to manipulate them and keep them away from there.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I replied, "The □ button,",</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi looked away from the screen, "Umm," she said, searching for the button for a moment, then,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ei!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said, pressing the button clumsily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her free shot from a close range of the goal naturally shook the net. The live commentator shouted, "Gooooooooooal!",&nbsp; and Izumi, too, was happy and unexpectedly high-spirited, saying "Yay!" and extending her hand as if to ask me for a high five.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">I could see her armpits and the white fabric of her underwear through the gap in her short-sleeved T-shirt, and while I was startled at her defenselessness, I raised my hand and exchanged a high five with Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Uwaa, you beat me!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I stared at my overreacting brother with blank eyes. I thought again that if we weren't siblings, he would never be the type of guy I would associate with.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The three of us played games for about 30 minutes, and then Izumi said she would call her mother and go back to her room. I, along with my brother, headed upstairs to my room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm tired."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When we entered my room, my brother sat down on the bed and said so. I sat down in the desk chair positioned facing him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I muttered, "I think it was the first time I had ever seen Izumi so excited," to which my brother replied in surprise, "Is that so?".</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think she is still shy. Compared to when we first started, she seems to be getting used to it these days."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. But it's great that she's trying to adapt to the sudden change of environment."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah," I nodded, and my brother looked at me and said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But it looks like you did pretty well, too."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Because you were able to get along with that girl a lot. You're pretty shy. I was worried that if you ignored Rina-chan, things would get awkward at home, but I'm glad to see that you were able to communicate well with her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... I didn't actively talk to her or anything. Rather, Izumi often talked to me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see. Well, I'm glad to hear you guys are doing well. ---But seriously, don't you ever get h*rny? I'm being rather serious."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He asked me with a really serious face. I wonder what in the world is serious to this person.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, never."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......I'm worried in a different way when you answer me that immediately. Are you okay as a man?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Not all men are like you, Ryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I tried to cover it up with a wry smile, but to be honest, it's not like there were never any moments like that. At first, it was hard to suppress my bad fantasies, especially when I was taking a bath after Izumi had entered the bathtub.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Trying to avoid continuing to talk about Izumi, I sat back in my chair and changed the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"By the way, mom said we're going to visit dad's grave, so if you want to come, you should clear your schedule."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, my brother nodded his head and muttered, "Is it that time already?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My father died three years ago in August when I was in the second year of junior high school. It was due to a sudden stroke while he was on a plane to attend a conference.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My father had published several technical books and occasionally wrote commentaries in newspapers, but he was not so famous as a so-called "public speaker" and was a professor at a private university.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, one time he appeared on TV and made a statement about a social issue that was hot at the time, and was temporarily bashed severely by people with different arguments. According to my mother, there was nothing too extreme and no real damage, but at the time he seemed to be under a lot of stress, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although we do not know the consequence clearly now, I think it must have had some influence on my father's health condition, which had always been high blood pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the day my parents returned to this house in the provincial city where they were born, after a funeral service attended by relatives and friends of my father's when he was young, and after his ashes were placed in the grave of my father's family, my brother carried the books in my father's reading room, which is now my mother's workroom, like ants to his own room. Most of the books that now make up the interior of my room are part of that collection.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For the next year, until he left home, my brother spent all the time at home reading books. It was as if he was taking books from my father's library into his own head. Even while we were eating, he had a book in his hand, and as a junior high school student, I was worried that he had lost his mind. Almost every day, he carried a different book. In addition to Japanese and English, there was even a book in French (my brother was in the department of French literature at the time). At a terrifying pace, he was chipping away at the wall-like piles of books my father had left behind. I had always thought he was quite a brilliant man, but his concentration at that moment was overwhelming.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Two years later, my brother, who had left home, suddenly told mom about his plans to go on to higher education, along with a report that he had passed the graduate school exam.</p>
<p class="calibre6">From my mother's point of view, she probably had a strong desire to stop her son from choosing the same direction in life as my father. My mother told him that going on to graduate school in the humanities was not a wise choice unless he was very talented and that she wanted him to go straight to work for a general company, but he refused to listen and forcefully decided on his own career path.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"After all, did dad influence you to decide to go on to higher education and do philosophy?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked him, he laughed briefly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'd like to say no, but I guess it's impossible to say that he didn't influence me at all. But I have always been interested in philosophy. Even in high school, I would read books like Karatani Koujin and Yoshimoto Takaaki behind his back."</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : both are Japanese philosophers and literary critics.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why did you hide...."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I was embarrassed. I thought people would say, 'Student from how many decades ago were you.' I liked to read books by myself, so I didn't want to be bothered by someone who knows it all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee-- I didn't expect that. I didn't know you had that side of you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......You, what do you think I am..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Flashy guy."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, my brother laughed brightly and said, "You idiot," Even when he uses abusive language, the way he says it is frank and his smile is refreshing, so it doesn't give a bad impression. I thought that this kind of feeling must be what makes people like him. And then, just a moment ago, the part where he was talking with Izumi in a friendly manner came back to my mind, and I felt that unidentifiable heartache again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Before long, my brother got up from the bed where he was sitting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then I' m going to go home. I have a book I have to read this week."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah. Okay."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We left the room and headed downstairs. As we went downstairs, Izumi also came out of her room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuuichi-san, are you leaving?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi hurried down the stairs and called out to my brother, who was putting on his shoes in front of the entrance. He replied with his usual cheerful, flashy guy-like expression, as if he had nothing profound on his mind, "Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll come to visit you again. Let's all go somewhere together during the summer break. I have a driver's license, so I can take you anywhere you want to go."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Really? I'm looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi replied happily to my brother's suggestion. During this night, Izumi had also become completely let her guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We stood side by side and watched my brother put on his shoes at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"See you then, Rina-chan, Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi gave a small wave across her face and I also raised one hand. Just before he walked out the door, my brother looked at me and sent me a frivolous smile, "See you later."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With a slam, the door closed and silence descended. Our hands, which had been raised, also fall.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"....... Somehow, it's getting lonely in the house," Izumi said, staring at the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so?" Izumi turned her eyes toward me as if she were peeping at me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey Kenichi, I want to play the game again."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Then, let's do that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded and Izumi and I headed for the living room. We turned on the game console and sat down on the sofa side by side. The quiet house began to echo with the lively sound of the game.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I taught Izumi how to operate the console. Izumi, holding the controller, was as excited as a child who has been given a new toy. It was her first time playing a video game, and she seemed to be quite addicted to it. I was a little worried that my crude living environment might have a bad influence on Izumi, who apparently grew up in a nice all-girls school.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</div></div>

<p class="calibre6">After that, when my mother came home, I tidied up the game console and Izumi put the food my brother had cooked in the microwave.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuu-kun was here a while ago."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I told her about my brother's visit, my mother responded half-heartedly as she placed her luggage on the sofa. For someone who is always so concerned about him, her response was surprisingly cold.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"He also made that dinner."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With a "hmmm," my mother sat at the dining room table and drank the tea Izumi had brewed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Before long, Izumi took a plate out of the microwave and held it out in front of my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks, Rina-chan," my mother replied with a pleasant smile that she showed only to Izumi among our family, and then she ate the dinner that my brother had prepared nonchalantly. She didn't seem to think it tasted particularly good or bad.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, Izumi went back to her room and I turned on the TV and watched a news program that was on. Then my mother talked to me, "Kenichi, just a minute."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What were you talking about with him?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother had finished her dinner, she put her fork on an empty plate, took a cup of tea, and turned her head toward me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What were we talking about... well, many things. It seems that Ryuu-kun's objective was to meet Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"He didn't say anything weird, did he?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It was relatively all right......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, remembering what my brother had said and done earlier. He hadn't said anything harsh or vulgar, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with what he said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Relatively, huh."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother let out a sigh that sounded both relieved and dismayed. I then briefly explained what had happened since his arrival.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"We also talked a bit about Ryuu-kun. Why he went to graduate school and what he's studying now."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she said, "Hmm," and my mother began to speak with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"When Ryuuichi said he would go on to higher education, I was indeed against it quite strongly....... but since Ryuuichi is smart even though he is an idiot, I think he has enough potential to become a scholar...... Recently, there are not many positions available at universities, and it seems to be a difficult world, but I am sure he will do well, including the option of working for a company."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But," my mother continued after taking a sip of the tea she was holding in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ryuuichi was a boy who often bumped into people. I'm worried about that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"............ you mean, like quarreling?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Not that, but physically. When we went shopping or to the library together when he was younger, he would wander around, blocking other people's way and causing trouble. In short, he was unable to look at his surroundings. He only thought about the world as he saw it, and never considered the possibility that someone might come up behind or beside him. There were many times when he would bump into an adult and burst into tears."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother looked somewhat nostalgic as she said this, and a faint wry smile crossed her face. Imagining that scene, I thought to myself, "That was very Ryuu-kun-like." I don't know what my brother was like when he was younger because we are so far apart in age, but he certainly seemed to be pretty active.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Maybe that's why Ryuu-kun was so bad at playing soccer. That sport requires not only technique and physical strength, but also a sense of how people will move next."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I half-jokingly said, " Perhaps," my mother nodded her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"When I look at Ryuuichi now, I see that the spirit of the triplets has not changed at all. When he was little, he was always going out somewhere where people would gather, so I was always a little worried. In the future, I hope he doesn't bump into someone somewhere and end up upset."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Indeed, he looks like he has a terrible relationship with women."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I somehow said this, my mother put her hand to her forehead and let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's the difference with you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">The words came back to me harshly, and I could only give a vague reaction, "Hmmm.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---Well, in that aspect, Kenichi was a boy who looked at his surroundings properly and put himself in a position not to bother others. Although he was shy, he was quiet and easier to take care of than Ryuuichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">It had been a long time since I had had such a long talk with my mother. Since Izumi's arrival, I felt that even the environment, which should have had nothing to do with her presence, had begun to change in subtle ways.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the conversation was all settled, I got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm going back to my room. You can leave the dishes as they are. I'll wash them later."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay. Then, please. I'm going to take a bath and go to bed."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good night."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said that and left the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I turn on the light on the staircase that Izumi had so diligently turned off. Warm light filled the room. As I reached the top of the stairs, I heard a low sound from behind the door of Izumi's dark brown room, as if a closet was being opened. It was the time when the date was about to change. It takes her an hour and a half to get to school, and her morning comes early. She has laid out the futon and is probably going to bed. A cool breeze blew weakly through the screen door in the upstairs hallway.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">It was Sunday, a few days after my brother's visit to our house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was going home alone after club activities from 1 pm to 4 pm. Yuriko, who usually comes home with me, was absent from club activities today due to family business.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At this time of the year when the days are long, the sky was still bright after 4pm, and the sharp hot sunlight was shining down on the city.</p>

<p class="calibre6">As I left the school, running along the national highway and approaching a park at the edge of a residential area, a girl with her hair in a single ponytail came running in front of me. She was wearing pink running clothes and black shorts.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I thought she looked familiar, I realized it was Izumi. I didn't recognize her at first glance because she had her hair tied up in a high ponytail, which was different from her usual style.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Perhaps Izumi noticed me, too, and stopped there and called out to me. I grabbed the brake of my bicycle and stopped near Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you just getting home? Thank you for your hard work."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She asked me with a small gasp. I nodded and got off the bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Looking closer, the pink training shirt Izumi was wearing was a rather slim compression type, clearly emphasizing the lines of her surprisingly well-defined body. " Were you working out, Izumi?" I asked,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. I just had some free time, so I decided to go for a walk. I thought I'd take a walk around this area."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi replied as she pulled a handkerchief towel from her pocket and wiped the sweat from her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so?" as I replied, Izumi looked behind me and opened her mouth, "Ah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's Aiko-chan."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I looked back, I saw a girl I had seen the other day, Hoshino-san, walking down the concrete sidewalk with a brown dog. It was a small dog with short legs that walked in quick little steps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi waved her hand and called for Hoshino-san. She was wearing a miniskirt of jeans fabric, a white T-shirt, and a knapsack of cloth fabric on her back.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san, who was walking in a daze, looked up and, perhaps noticing Izumi, her expression brightened, and soon after, her eyes met mine, who was standing next to Izumi, and she fidgeted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked up at me as she approached us and said, "Um, we met the other day, didn't we? Um......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">It seemed she had forgotten my name, so I said, "I'm Sakamoto," and I introduced myself again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I-I-I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With such a brief greeting, it would have been more difficult to remember my name, but Hoshino-san bowed her head in panic.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, no, it's all right."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I felt like I had somehow troubled her, so I put my hand on the back of my head. I've often been told that I'm unsociable in the way I speak and look, so I tried to soften my tone as much as possible, thinking I might be scaring her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Watching this with a wry smile, Izumi folded her knees and squatted down beside the dog, which was sitting quietly at his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The dog looked at Izumi with a "Who is this?" look, but did not seem to be barking or acting out of control. The dog seemed to be well trained and smart.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is it okay if I touch him?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Izumi asked, yes, Hoshino-san nodded her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She slowly reached out her hand and patted the dog's head. The dog seemed to be friendly and was very accustomed to being petted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's his name?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi asked while patting the dog.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Stella. He is a male dog, three years old."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Stella-kun. That's kind of a stylish name, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Stella's eyes gradually began to narrow, as if he was comfortable being patted by Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why Stella?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I could only think of a minicar with the same name, so I asked her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Um, it means 'star' in Italian, my family name is Hoshino."</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : 星/Hoshi means star</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I responded, "Were you just out for a walk?" Izumi asked, patting Stella's head as she squatted down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes. He likes this park."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san said, looking toward the park. The park is quite large and well maintained, and many people use it for running and walking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, can I come with you for a walk? I've never been in this park."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi stood up and said so. As if attracted by her movement, Stella turned his long and narrow nose upward.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yeah. It's okay," Hoshino-san nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had never seen how Izumi behaved when she was with her friends. So I was a little curious to see how they would talk to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Um, can I come with you too?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san nodded her head, though she remained still and looked a bit puzzled.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</div></div>

<p class="calibre6">I parked my bicycle in the bicycle parking lot and entered the park with the girls.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The structure of the park is a bit unusual, with a grassy field and a pond side by side. The two are surrounded by a paved road in the shape of figure eight. The sidewalk was flanked by large sakura and ginkgo trees, and at this time of year, when the leaves are in full growth, the sidewalk is flooded with a slightly green-tinted light that shines through the foliage.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The three of us walked along that paved sidewalk, and every time Stella went to smell the plants on the side, we stopped and waited for him to start walking again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There were a few other people running on the sidewalk beside us. A few birds were pecking at something at the roots of the surrounding trees.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While walking, Hoshino-san and Izumi were talking about school. The names of people I don't know, whether they are friends or teachers of the girls, were flying around. Izumi's tone of voice was almost the same as when she talked to me and my mother at home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I walked behind them, Stella would occasionally look back at me and give me curious eyes. As if to say, "Why is this guy following me?" I smiled bitterly every time I saw his eyes. Then, with 'pui', Stella turned her head forward in a cute way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There are several gazebos around the pond at the back of the park. We took a break in one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A sign was attached to the wooden railing facing the pond that said, "Do not feed the Koi." But as I approached the pond, a large number of Koi, obviously expecting to be fed, gathered around, making a lot of splashing noises, and peeked out of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"They looked like zombies."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi, who came next to me, looked down at the Koi and said so. Indeed, the Koi were gathering like zombies. There were also several water birds and turtles swimming in the pond.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san sat down on a large, square, wooden bench, pulled out a water bottle from the knapsack she was carrying, and began to drink. Stella, perhaps tired from his stroll, lay at his feet, flat on the ground up to his chin, in a perfect resting position.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the wind blew, the sound of the leaves on the surrounding trees rustling could be heard loudly. The surface of the pond in early summer, which looked slightly greenish with clusters of aquatic plants, reflected the sky like a mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and I leaned against the railing for a while and watched the raging Koi silently, and then we sat down on the bench where Hoshino-san was sitting, side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a while, we could hear the noisy sound of the Koi splashing around in the water, but after Izumi and I were out of sight, the area became quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How long have you been Izumi's friend, Hoshino-san?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I coughed to dispel the silence and asked her this, and she closed the lid of her water bottle. Then, she replied to my question, though her tone was still nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"We had known each other since middle school, but last year we were in the same class for the first time. Then we became good friends."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said, "I see," and nodded my head. As I thought, Hoshino-san had been attending the same private school as Izumi for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, "What is Izumi like at school?" I asked her what I was most curious about. Hoshino-san smiled softly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She' s reliable, stylish, and popular with the other students in her class."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's not true."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hearing Hoshino-san's answer, Izumi smiled bitterly and was modest, but if she is as diligent as she shows at school and at home, I am sure it must be true.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then we fell silent again and sat on the bench for a while, listening to the rustling of leaves. Suddenly, damp wind blew. Then the sun went down and the area suddenly became dark.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, it's raining."</p>
<p class="calibre6">A waterfowl flew out of the pond, as Izumi muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The rain drizzled down and made a black stain around where we were. I thought it might be an evening shower, but the rain was not that heavy. Stella reacted to the sound of the rain by twitching his ears and lifting his head from where he was lying.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Did they say it was going to rain today?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said as she looked up at the gray sky. Looking at the weather website, it looked like rain clouds were moving into the area where we were. It's not that big of a cloud, so it will stop soon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Maybe it's just temporary. A small rain cloud is moving in," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi stood up and looked at the sky, then sat down on a bench. The wooden roof and the sound of rain falling on the pond echoed around us. Raindrops were falling on the surface of the pond, creating an intricate ripple pattern of countless round patterns that interfered with each other. We sat and stared at the scene. The sound of the park's trees catching the rain filled the area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sakamoto-san, you are a relative of Rina-chan, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, Hoshino-san opened her mouth and asked me, who was sitting beside her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded, and she continued her question in a casual tone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"In which area is your home?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi, who had been quietly staring at the pond, suddenly looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I was mumbling how to reply, Izumi interrupted from beside me, "You know,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"---The house I moved into is Kenichi-kun's house."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh?" Hoshino-san's voice seemed to leak out spontaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But, the other day......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she looked at me. I felt a little guilty at her gaze, which contained a hint of doubt. It seemed that Izumi had not yet told Hoshino-san that we were living together. I felt I had to tell her, so I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I misled you. I thought it would be too much trouble to explain the situation to you. ............... Sorry."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The truth is, it wasn't just that. Without knowing what kind of person Hoshino-san is or what kind of relationship she has with Izumi, I had a lot of selfish assumptions that Hoshino-san might have bad thoughts about us.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......So you two live together?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino asked, looking at the two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi nodded her head in a firm manner.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/74rNp7G/000008.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">"......Relatives, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Relatives. I'm going to be staying with them for a while from now on."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san remained silent for a few moments, holding the water bottle on his lap with both hands, and then smiled, "Geez,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her tone was not angry, but light, as if she was trying to end this conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. It was a little hard to say," Izumi said with a smile on her face. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that," I said, apologizing from the side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But living with a boy your age is like something out of a manga, isn't it? I like that kind of situation. Ah, but I'm not imagining anything weird about Rina-chan and you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san, who was a bit excited, said so, and Izumi bitterly laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Do you like manga?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked, Hoshino-san nodded, a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"She likes it very much. Aiko-chan has a bookshelf in her room that is as big as Kenichi-kun's, and it is lined with manga. Especially stories about boys and boys in love......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Izumi continued her story, Hoshino shouted, " Waah--!". Startled, Stella raised her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You can't talk about that---"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh? Why not? You said before that this is literature. Kenichi-kun, he's a book lover, so maybe we can talk about it. Err, what's it called again? Bi-el......?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Stop it!!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hoshino-san turned bright red, and Izumi, perhaps not understanding what was going on, looked puzzled, but still feeling overwhelmed by her desperation, apologized and stopped talking, saying, "S-Sorry......,". I had generally figured out Hoshino-san's hobbies as we talked, but Izumi seemed to have no knowledge of that side of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I pretended not to have heard anything, and while scratching my head, I muttered, "I hope the rain stops soon," and looked at the pond.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A private all-girls junior and senior high school is a completely different world to me, and I had no idea what it was like to live there, but this exchange gave me a glimpse of how Izumi and Hoshino-san were spending their time at school.</p>


<p class="calibre6">After about ten minutes, the rain began to drizzle and then stopped. The sky was still covered with thin clouds, but the surroundings were becoming brighter, and the slight red of the setting sun was beginning to mix with the sunlight.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When the rain stopped, we left the gazebo, walked along the pavement, and headed for the park exit. The smell of fresh air was rising from the rain-soaked plants, along with the humid heat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After leaving the park, Hoshino-san's house seemed to be in the same direction as ours, so we walked together along a residential street.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although many of the buildings in this area are relatively new, the street near the park is lined with several old-fashioned private stores. A barbershop with a red, blue, and white spiraling sign, a butcher shop with a cash register on a glass case in front of the store, a ramen shop with an old sign with faded letters and reddish-brown rust on it, a bakery with flowers in a planter in front of the store, an Izakaya with their red noren curtains, stained with grease. All of them are small stores that seem to have blended into the daily life of the neighborhood over a long period of time.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N : noren, sign curtain hung at shop entrance, Izakaya&nbsp;is a type of informal Japanese bar that serves alcoholic drinks and snacks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">As we passed through these streets and eventually came to a crossroads, Hoshino-san stopped with Stella and said, "We're going this way."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The road pointed out by Hoshino-san was a steep slope. At the top of the hill was a tall steel tower with long, bending power lines stretching in two directions. Under the setting sun, the steel material looked like a dull copper color.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"See you later, Rina-chan."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. See you at school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi replied, then folded her knees and gave him a pat on the head, "See you later, Stella-kun." Stella's tail wagged from side to side as if to say, "Bye-bye," with a clear expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I also raised my hand in a small gesture, saying "goodbye," and Hoshino-san bowed in return. Then she took Stella's leash and headed up the hill.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Shall we go home, too?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah," Izumi nodded her head as she watched Hoshino-san walking up the hill.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It is only a few minutes from this crossroads to our house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As we walked together down a street lined with similar-looking houses, somehow Izumi was taking more distance from me than usual. The rain from earlier had left the concrete black and wet, and the weeds on the roadside were covered with numerous droplets of water, reflecting the surrounding scenery on their transparent spherical surfaces.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. It was better to explain at that time after all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I opened my mouth as the house was in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's all right. Besides, it's not only Kenichi-kun, but also I was hesitant to say anything about it and kept silent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi looked down slightly and said so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I wondered if she felt the same embarrassment about living with me as I did, even though she seems to be simple, full of holes, and not very good at relationships with the opposite sex. Thinking of this, for some reason, a small feeling similar to happiness spread like a ripple in my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Finally, we arrived at the house, twisted the doorknob, which reflected the setting sun, and entered the house. As soon as the door was closed, the unlit entranceway suddenly became dim.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm home," Izumi said, perhaps to my mother in her downstairs room. She changed from her running shoes to slippers and gave me a diffident look.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Umm, I'm sweating a lot, Can I use the shower first?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah," I nodded as I took off my leather shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you. Then,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi went straight to the bathroom and I went into my room. I turned on the light and put my enamel bag on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I sat in my desk chair, a mild feeling of drowsiness overcame me. As I closed my eyes in slumber, I heard the faint sound of a shower in the silence.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">When I entered the living room the next morning, I found Izumi sitting on the sofa, still in her pajamas. She was wearing a thin, long-sleeved hoodie over her shirt. My mother was standing in front of Izumi, bending down a bit to talk with her about something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I immediately felt uncomfortable when I saw her. At this time before school, Izumi was usually already dressed in her school uniform and eating breakfast with her bag by her side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked both of them, I heard a small electronic sound. Izumi put one hand on the chest of her T-shirt and took something out of her clothes. It was a thermometer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think I caught a cold......," Izumi said, looking at it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh no, you have a fever, too. You should take a rest today. I'll call your school."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother said, looking at the thermometer she had received from Izumi. "I'm sorry," Izumi replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you all right?" I asked her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes. When I woke up in the morning, my body felt heavy. I was fine until last night......I was sweating a lot last night, so maybe that wasn't a good thing......."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She replied with a small cough. Her throat did not seem to be in good condition, and her voice sounded a bit wetter than usual. The cheeks were also somewhat reddish.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry if I'm passing on my cold......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, I'm probably fine......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I'm not feeling sick anywhere, and I've never been sick this time of year before.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Rina-chan, give me your school phone number."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Our conversation was interrupted when my mother, holding the telephone, asked Izumi from beside me. When Izumi looked at her cell phone and gave her the number, my mother informed them of her absence from school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi then ate only half a loaf of bread with honey and hot milk and took some cold medicine we had at home. Then she walked back to her room with a staggering gait. When I called out to her back, "Get well soon," she coughed a few times, holding her mouth with a hand that pulled her sleeve down to her fingertips, and said, "Thanks. Do your best in school," lifting her reddened cheeks gently and forming a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A little later than usual, my mother went to work, and I cleaned up the dishes and went outside. It was cloudy and dark outside. I put my bicycle out on the street and straddle it. When I looked back at the window of Izumi's room, I saw that the thick curtains were closed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The gray clouds gradually became darker and darker, and by midday, it began to rain. Looking out from the fluorescent-lit classroom, it looked terribly dim. Even after six classes, the rain showed no sign of stopping.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Since the club could not use the field because of the rain, we had to do muscle training in the hallway, as is customary in the event of rainy weather. We formed a line and did push-ups, sit-ups, back-ups, and squats for three sets of 20 times, with the first person who finished reporting back to Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I changed into my soccer wear and took my breaks in the fifth-floor hallway on the top floor of the school building, where there were few students around. While the other members of the club were moving their bodies languidly in single file, Yuriko was the only one with a nonchalant look on her face, holding a ballpoint pen and clipboard in her hand and looking at us as if she were a watcher.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The temperature was not so high, rather chilly in short sleeves, but the humidity was high and I started to sweat lightly after the second set.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After finishing push-ups and sit-ups, I sat with my back leaning against the wall. Next to me, for some reason, Tachibana was doing muscle training with me. She was currently doing sit-ups, but her arm holding the back of her head had been trembling since a while ago, and there was no movement at all. This state continued for a while, and then, "Guu," I heard a groan.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm giving up......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana muttered to herself, broke her posture, and leaned against the wall just as I did.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sigh. I'm tired."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why are you doing muscle training too?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked her, Tachibana replied, "I want to be slimmer for the summer."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was not fat by any means, but perhaps because she looked like a little girl, her stomach seemed rather pudgy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I feel like my stomach is getting slightly smaller."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said as she patted her belly over her gym clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmmm. That's great."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, it went badly. Thinking about it normally, there is no way it would have had an effect in such a short period of time, right? Even though I made it easy for you to respond to my words. Sakamoto-senpai, as usual, you don't seem to care about other people."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's not true."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said and moved my body to start back-ups. Then Tachibana let out a dumbfounded voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Muu. That's what makes you seem cold. Let's go with a more friendly character."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Unconsciously, my body stopped moving. Tachibana's murmur echoed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Do I look cold to you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"A bit."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I got an immediate answer. It was unexpected, but I felt less tense when she affirmed it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And I felt uncomfortable with myself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had been told the same thing by Yuriko many times before. But this was the first time I had felt so bothered by something like this. Before I knew it, I felt that something was slowly changing in me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, don't talk among yourselves in there!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko, wearing a blue jersey underneath and a gym shirt on top, called out to us.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-senpai, I'm going back to work as a manager."</p>
<p class="calibre6">After saying this, Tachibana stood up and walked to Yuriko's side.</p>


<p class="calibre6">After club activities, I went home with Yuriko and the other club members. It was raining, so we left our bicycle and took the bus.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was already dark because the sky was covered with rain clouds, and the cars on the street had their lights on. As I sat in my seat and looked out the raindrop-stained window at the gray, wet city, I somehow remembered the day I first met Izumi. Looking back, I was quite nervous at the time, but now I feel that Izumi's presence in our home has become a normal part of my life. Neither of us talks that much in the house, but the silence hardly bothers me these days.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But what about Izumi's? I have no experience of living in a relative's house for a long period of time, so I don't know what that would actually be like. It's hard to imagine.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Suddenly, Tachibana's voice echoed in my head, "That's what makes you seem cold,"</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was the same when she said it directly to me, but for some reason, it made me feel a little uneasy. The way Tachibana said it was obviously just a casual remark.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The bus soon approached the residential area where we lived and I got off at the same stop as Yuriko. Yuriko opened her umbrella and took a step forward, and I called out to her back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hmm. What?" she looked back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm going to stop by the supermarket. You can go home first."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, then I'll go with you. I was just about to run out of loose-leaf paper."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko replied, and together we went to a medium-sized, two-story supermarket on the outskirts of the residential area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Thinking that porridge would be good for Izumi, who had a cold, for dinner tonight, I went into the store and bought some eggs, chicken, and other ingredients that I thought would be useful. At this time of the evening, there were many ladies in the store. Yuriko and I went around the store, did some quick shopping, and then headed for the drugstore that was attached to the store.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What? Are you still going to buy something?" Yuriko, who was walking beside me, asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Cold medicine."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I replied as I walked over to the shelf by the doorway, she gave me a puzzled look.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Are you getting a cold?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, it wasn't me. It was Izumi......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, Izumi-san? Is she all right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Probably. She had a fever in the morning and was absent from school. It didn't seem that bad, so I think she will be okay, but.......The medicine we have at home was almost out, so I thought I'd take it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As I picked up a few boxes and was comparing prices and efficacy, a man in a lab coat approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Can I help you?" said the young man, who appeared to be a pharmacist. I told him about Izumi's symptoms, remembering how she had looked this morning. In the middle of the conversation, Yuriko walked away, as if she wanted to buy something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The pharmacist recommended one medicine. I took the box to the cashier and paid the bill. I put the medicine in my enamel bag and left the drugstore, where I found Yuriko waiting for me outside.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Here. I brought this for her. When you have a fever, it drains your energy."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Saying this, she gave me a nutritional supplement drink with store tape on it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">It had a pink label, and the illustrations and font of the written text were designed for women, with a tender impression. It also says that it is good for dry skin.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Get well soon, tell her that for me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Thank you."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I thanked her, took it, and put it away in my bag. Then,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......By the way, you've changed, Kenichi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The unexpected words continued.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I had been focused on my hand, but I looked up and said, "Eh? What do you mean?" She smiled for a moment and said, "It's nothing," and then started to walk out. I took a step behind her and started walking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was raining outside, and in the short time we had been in the store, it had gotten even darker.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</div></div>

<p class="calibre6">When I opened the front door, the house was completely dark. Izumi was supposed to be there, but there was no sound. I wondered if she was still sleeping in her room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took off my shoes, went into the living room, put the cold medicine in the medicine box, and put the ingredients and the nutritional supplement drink that Yuriko had given me in the refrigerator. The light from the refrigerator spread into the dark kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, I went upstairs and noticed that light was leaking through a crack in the door of Izumi's room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I tried to listen carefully to check if she was awake, but all I could hear was the sound of rain hitting the roof.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi, are you awake?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I asked so while knocking softly. But there was no answer. My voice and the sound of knocking soon faded away into the quietness of the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After some hesitation, I put my hand on the doorknob. It was unlocked. I opened the door slightly. I was about to call out from here but stopped myself immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The futon in the middle of the room, and a blanket curled up on top of it, came into my sight. Her dark hair was spread out around her pillow. I could also see that the curled-up blanket was moving up and down just slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">......Let's just turn off the light.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Thinking that she would not be able to rest if the light was left on, I opened the slightly opened door and took a step into her room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The smell in Izumi's room was different from when it was a storage room. There was a pink air freshener on the desk. There were still few things in the room, and a uniform hanging on the wall stood out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I pressed the switch on the wall and turned off the light, the entire room was suddenly plunged into darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although I had lived in the house for about ten years, I did not feel that the dark, dimly lit Izumi's room, with the echoing sound of rain, was my home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was standing near Izumi's feet. Izumi's sleeping face was almost hidden by her hair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">---I guess she must be tired.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although we don't spend much time together in a day, I know she has been working hard every day. She doesn't look that strong, and with such a change in environment, it would be strange if she didn't get sick.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good work," I muttered to myself. As I was about to leave the room, Izumi suddenly shifted in the blanket and turned over on her back. The hair covering her profile fell gently, and her sleeping face was reflected in my monochrome, dimly-lit vision.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My gaze was unconsciously drawn to her soft cheeks and smooth lips that were slightly open, and my pulse thumped. Her black hair was sticking to her ears and forehead due to sweat from her sleep, which made her look rather charming. Moreover, I think her shirt got pulled when she turned over in her sleep, and the area below her collarbone, where it is starting to softly bulge out, is also......</p>
<p class="calibre6">---I shouldn't be here, I felt in the depths of my consciousness, which had melted into the darkness and somewhat blurred my sense of reality. I took my eyes off Izumi, walked out of her room, and slowly closed the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The hallway, with no lights on, was just as dark as her room. I exhaled the tepid breath that had built up inside me and then inhaled. The air outside felt nice and cold, and my chest got chilly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I entered my room, turned on the light, and lay down on my bed. In my mind, I keep picturing Izumi's sleeping face, which I saw in the darkness. Whenever I think of her face, my heart heats up and starts to beat loudly. The sound of the rain neither became stronger nor weaker, but kept echoing, in the same way, all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I lay down, I suddenly felt exhausted. As if drawn in by the darkness behind my eyelids, my consciousness gradually blurred.......</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆ ☆ ☆</p></div>

<p class="calibre6">"I'm home," My mother's voice woke me up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The moment I opened my eyes, the fluorescent light whitened out my vision. I felt pain and closed my eyes tightly. When I slowly opened my eyelids again, the familiar ceiling of my room was there.</p>
<p class="calibre6">My whole body feels hot and sweaty. I move my eyes down and see my uniform and bed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took the clock by my bedside. The two hands on the clock showed that it was past 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was about 6:00 p.m. when I got home, meaning I had slept almost three hours.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The center of my head was numb and I felt lazy. I lay in a daze for a while, but then I remembered that I hadn't cooked dinner, and I got up in a hurry. I took off my uniform and changed into my loungewear.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I shoved the shirt I had been wearing all day into the washing machine and opened the living room door.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh. Kenichi-kun," Izumi, who had apparently been having a conversation with my mother, said, looking at me. When my mother looked back at me, she complained, "You're on duty for dinner now, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Sorry, I fell asleep."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What should I do now that you've fallen asleep?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry. I'll make it right away."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I took the ingredients I had bought out of the refrigerator. Then my mother said to Izumi gently, "You look much better," and left the living room. I guessed she was going to her room to change her clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi and I were left alone. Izumi was dressed in pajamas and a hoodie, the same as this morning. In the bright light, her expression was much clearer than it had been this morning when the fever had blurred it. My pulse thumped once more, remembering the alluring look of the sleeping Izumi I had seen earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I asked her, "Are you feeling okay?" She replied, "Yes, my cough has stopped, and I think I will be able to go to school tomorrow."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Seeing Izumi's usual soft appearance, I felt a pain in my chest again.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">---Not good. I felt that she was so cute.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I immediately turned my head away from Izumi, took out a nutritional drink I had stored in the refrigerator, and handed it to Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"This is from Yuriko. I stopped by the drugstore on my way home. She said, 'Get well soon,'"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you," Izumi said, accepting it with girlish tension.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Tell her thank you," Izumi said.</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Got it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I replied quickly, trying not to look at Izumi's face too much, and stood in the kitchen to cook dinner. My mom and I are fine with porridge now. If I made a special menu just for her, she would be concerned about me again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's wrong? Your face looks a bit off."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi stood next to me and tilted her head as if to look into my face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Could it be that you've caught a cold after all?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Don't worry, it's not like that!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">She tilted her head even more when I said strongly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I-Is that so? Then I'm glad to hear that......Oh, do you want me to help you cook dinner?</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's okay. Just take a seat. You just got better."&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said so, and sent Izumi back to the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I was alone in the kitchen, I felt a brief moment of relief. Washing my hands with cold water seemed to cool my flushing heart, and I finally began to feel calm.</p>

<p class="calibre6">But what was that suffocating feeling as if my heart was burning in my chest earlier?</p>
