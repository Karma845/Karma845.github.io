<h2 class="calibre5">Chapter 2 - New Daily Life</h2><span><a name="more" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre"></a></span>


<p class="calibre6">Two days have passed since Izumi moved in, and the week has begun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I woke up to the alarm on my phone set for 6:30 a.m., changed into my school uniform, went to the bathroom to straighten my sleeping habits, and went to the living room where Izumi and my mother were already sitting facing each other at the dining table having breakfast. Izumi was sitting across from my mother, facing the door, and her eyes met mine immediately as I walked into the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was wearing her school uniform, which consisted of a navy blue skirt with red checks, a cream-colored vest, and a red ribbon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi greeted me with a "good morning" while giving a brief nod.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good morning."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Biting back the drowsiness that still lingered dully in the back of my head, I answered, and my mother turned to me as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Rina-chan and I will leave first, so Kenichi, you take care of the cleanup."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I nodded, "Okay," I said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The time now was a little before seven o'clock. I commute to school in 20 minutes by bicycle, so if I leave home at 8:00 a.m., I can make it in time for the 8:30 a.m. start of school, but Izumi, who commutes to Tokyo, must be about to leave home by now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thank you for the meal," Izumi said, putting the dishes in the sink. She rolled up the sleeves of her long-sleeved blouse and started running water from the faucet with a sponge.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll take care of the cleanup, Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Izumi turned her troubled face to me and mouthed, "Yes, but......". All through yesterday, she had been helping me with the dishes and other household chores.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You might miss the train, so you better leave early. You might have to make a transit or something......It's the first time you've been to school since you moved here, right?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi put the sponge in her hand back in place with a plop.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"If Kenichi-kun says so."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's right, Rina-chan. You can use this guy without hesitation."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi nodded with a wry smile at my mother's words and then picked up her school bag that was hanging on the chair.</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the one on the left</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm off then."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She slung his bag over her shoulder and headed for the front door, flapping his slippers. The house suddenly became quiet after the sound of shoes being put on and the door opening and closing at the front door.</p><p class="calibre6">I picked up one of the sandwiches that had been wrapped and placed on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Rina-chan, she helped me make breakfast and lunch earlier. I hope she didn't push herself too hard."</p>
<p class="calibre6">My mother looked at the cloth-wrapped lunch box on the table and muttered to herself. I had a vague feeling that Izumi was still concerned about the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After all, it had only been two days since she moved in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Maybe she'll get used to it after a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You should help out at home more than you have in the past. If you help her, she will be less burdened."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I know," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she finished her coffee, said, "Well, I have to go to work," and left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the living room in the morning when I was alone, I munched on a sandwich while watching the weather forecast.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">It's been relatively sunny today, as it has been for the past few days.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The clouds covering the sky were gray, close to white, and a little sunlight was leaking through the gaps. The concrete of the paved road is also almost dry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After riding my bicycle for about 20 minutes straight along the wide national highway between large stores, I see Irisawa High School, the high school I attended. Although it was supposed to be a preparatory school, it was an ordinary public high school where only a few students could pass the entrance exam to prestigious universities and medical schools. There were no strong clubs, including the soccer club I belonged to.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Passing the school gate with a bronze sculpture of a woman holding a ball in one hand and holding it up to the sky, I got off my bicycle and joined the crowd of people on the paved road with cherry blossom trees planted along the side. I park my bicycle at the prefabricated, roofed bicycle parking lot and head toward the entrance to the school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I change my shoes in front of the shoe box, walked up the stairs into the classroom, and sat down on my seat by the window. It was about ten minutes before homeroom started. The classroom was crowded with the chattering voices of students who had arrived at school one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Since this is not a school where only the talented or those with poor grades gather, there are many different types of people in the classroom, from serious-looking students who wear their uniforms properly to the more flamboyant ones who are dressed down and lightly dye their hair. The groups were usually divided by fashion trends.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The boys had formed three particularly close-knit groups. But I am not in any of them. Nagai, who is in the same club, is in my class, so I spend most of my free time with him. I have never had any inconvenience because of this.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I look at the type of people who try their best to create a character or constantly stay connected and communicate with each other, even online, I think it's amazing in both an honest and twisted way. I didn't have the ability or the motivation to participate in the tedious classroom communication game of choosing friends and groups to hang out with and tuning myself to them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After sitting down, and a short time later, Nagai came to school with an enamel bag slung over his shoulder. Sitting diagonally in front of me, he said lightly, "Yo,". I responded in a small voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After that, the homeroom teacher came to the classroom to check attendance, and after about ten minutes of homeroom, the first-period class began.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It's obvious, but just because Izumi moved in doesn't mean my school life will change. I was in the same class and followed the same timetable that I had repeated over and over again. For some reason, I felt at ease in this familiar routine. I had never felt such a thing before, so I thought that maybe I had been a little tense after all because I had a new roommate for the past two days.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, at lunchtime after four hours of morning classes, a female student with a short skirt, a short-sleeved blouse, and medium black hair with a few waves appeared at the classroom door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, hey."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I was about to put away my study materials and was about to open my lunch box. Yuriko entered the classroom and approached me. The boy in the seat in front of me had gone away, so she sat down in that seat and rested her cheek on my desk. A white scrunchie, which she sometimes uses during club activities, was wrapped around her wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You know, I saw you at the Irisawa Mall yesterday afternoon."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I let out a small breath. I knew you were going to talk about that, I thought. I stopped unwrapping my lunch box.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"There was auntie and a girl, right? Who was that girl?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I pondered for a while what to say, but finally, I answered shortly, "A relative,". Yuriko's eyes narrowed and she continued her question, still looking doubtful.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Did she has some business to do at your home?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, well,......"</p>
<p class="calibre6">It's hard to tell her when it comes to something like this. However even if I hid it, Yuriko, who lives nearby, would surely find out someday, and if I continued to hide it and she did find out, she would misunderstand me. I thought it would be a good time to tell Yuriko what had happened, so I whispered to her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Actually, we're going to take care of that girl for the next six months."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Haa!?"</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hYT8p1d/000007.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">With her voice, Yuriko's narrowed eyes widened, she lifted her hips, and let out a loud voice, loud enough to quiet the hustle and bustle of the lunch break.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko noticed that she was attracting stares, and then she sat down in her chair, smiling wryly at those around her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"But, she looked about the same age as us. Is she a cousin or something?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No... I think our parents were second cousins or something."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko raised her eyebrows when I answered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Isn't that mean you two are a stranger?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">To these words, I immediately replied, "No, we're relatives,". I tried to shake off the image of Izumi in her light clothing that I had seen the other day and continued with my explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Our mothers are relatives and good friends from long ago. Her name is Izumi Rina, and her mother had to be away from home for a long time for work, so she decided to come to our house. All the other relatives were in the countryside, and apparently, we were the only house within commuting distance of Izumi's high school, so she came to our house two days ago. That's all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"... Hmm. But, you seemed to be getting along pretty well, though. She seemed to get along well with auntie also."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It seems that my mother has met her several times."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How about you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I met her for the first time two days ago."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko gave me a suspicious look with her steady eyes. I don't understand. I'm sure I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is it okay to do that even if you're a relative?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't know what to say, but I'm not the one who made the decision. At the moment, Izumi and I hardly interfere with each other. We just have meals together."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hee."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at me with mean eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Nagai, who had gone to the school canteen to buy something, came back. He was holding a juice box in one hand and a bag of bread in the other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Huh? Mori, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai said to Yuriko as he sat in his seat diagonally in front of me. Yuriko also turned to Nagai and said, "Hey, listen, Nagai."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Wait a minute, don't tell everyone what's going on in my house!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said impatiently, and Yuriko's lips twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What? If you're going to keep quiet about it, you must have a guilty conscience."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm not!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I can't believe it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai, who was watching our exchange with a blank expression on his face, said,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I don't know what's going on, but you guys are as close as ever."</p>
<p class="calibre6">He said that and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko groaned.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"How can you look at this situation and think that we are getting along?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It looks like a lover's quarrel to me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai said teasingly to Yuriko. Yuriko was about to say something in response, but I impatiently nailed him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, seriously, don't say it. I don't want any weird rumors to come out about us."</p>
<p class="calibre6">She bent her mouth into the "へ" character, groaned for a moment, and then said,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Well, let's just say I've got one new weakness. It can't be helped. So, buy me a drink next time as hush money," she said to me with a doubtful expression on her face. She looked like she still didn't have enough explanation, but it seemed that Yuriko had read the atmosphere of the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okey okey, I know."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Looks like you were talking about something I wasn't supposed to hear."</p>
<p class="calibre6">With that, Nagai brought his chair closer to my desk, opened the bread package, and inserted a straw into the juice box.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After we had managed to get through our conversation, I opened my bento box as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The menu was almost the same as usual, with Karaage and egg rolls.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Yuriko, who was about to leave her seat, saw it and,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, your bento is a little different from usual," she said. I was caught off guard and was taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It's different from auntie's bento. She always put nori on top of her rice."</p>
<p class="calibre6">What the h*ll is this girl. So you pay attention to such things, huh. But it is true. If you look closely, you can see that the bento Izumi made for me has the same menu as usual, but the way it is arranged is a little different from usual.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nagai, who did not understand the context of the conversation, tilted his head, but perhaps thinking it was none of his business, took a bite of the yakisoba bread and sipped his orange juice through a straw.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko looked at me and the lunch box alternately and said, "Hmmm," meaningfully.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What is it?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Nothing at all."</p>
<p class="calibre6">And with that, she turned on her heel and walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After Yuriko was out of sight, Nagai asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So, what happened? Did you get in a fight?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No, we didn't."</p>
<p class="calibre6">We didn't, I guess. I didn't explain myself clearly, and I may have made her a little annoyed, but I don't think it was anything to the extent of a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So that's it. However, she seems to be in a bad mood."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yuriko is always like that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"That's true, But if Mori gets really mad, we will get in trouble during club activities, so do something for us. If she doesn't do her job, our practice will be less efficient."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I don't know what he meant by 'do something for us' but I nodded my head and said, "Yeah."</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>


<p class="calibre6">
  In the afternoon, the clouds of the rainy season had parted and the early
  summer red evening sun was illuminating the ground during the club's evening
  activities. The school building, painted with cream-colored paint, was stained
  red, and the red of the setting sun and the white light from the lights
  installed on the roof of the school building stretched the shadows of the
  students of the soccer and track clubs standing on the field.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  After the red-and-white game, the last practice session of the day was over,
  and the club members immediately began cleaning up. The freshmen went to work
  on field maintenance, and the guys nearby kicked the ball, which was scattered
  around the field, toward the benches. Tachibana went after the ball as it
  rolled by, picked it up with her hand, and popped it into the ball basket.
  Yuriko, who was with her by the bench, walked toward the pitch and collected
  the players' bibs.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">I took off my orange bib too and brought it to Yuriko.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  When Yuriko looked at me, she turned away with a 'Hmph' and snatched away only
  the bib.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I said, "What was that?" and Yuriko immediately replied, "What?" with a blank
  expression on her face.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  For a moment I was miffed, but then I let out a sigh and apologized, saying,
  "Lunchtime, I'm sorry."
</p>





<p class="calibre6">
  Since then, throughout the afternoon classes, I had felt that I had responded
  to Yuriko in a strange way, as if I had been making excuses or hiding
  something, as if there was something fishy going on during lunch break. If she
  had spoken to me like that, I would have thought she was acting strangely.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"I don't think there was anything to hide from you about that matter."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Yuriko returned her gaze to me, looked me in the eye, and then gave me a
  somewhat sarcastic, wry smile, as if to say, "It can't be helped."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "I'm fine with that. You've been honest with me in your own way. I don't think
  there's anything strange about you. I know you're far from that kind of
  thing."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"What's that?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Just like what I said."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Yuriko said with a wry smile as she walked beside me, gathering up the bibs
  she had collected.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "But, I'd like to meet her once, too, if possible. We live in the same
  neighborhood, and we might be able to get along."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Understood. I'll introduce you when I get a chance."</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. Please do it as soon as possible."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Yuriko said in a cheerful tone of voice and ran toward the equipment shed with
  a bunch of bibs.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  After the party broke up a little after 7:00 p.m., I went home with Yuriko and
  a few other soccer club members who were commuting by bicycle to school in the
  same direction and arrived home around 8:00 p.m. when the sun had completely
  set. The front door was locked. No lights were on in any of the rooms, so I
  guessed that no one had returned home yet.
</p>





<p class="calibre6">
  I took the key out of my bag, opened the front door, and entered the darkened
  house. I turned on the light switch, took off my shoes, went into my room,
  prepared a change of clothes, and headed for the bathroom to wash off my
  sweat.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  After taking a quick shower, cleaning the bathtub, and changing into shorts
  and a T-shirt, I sat down at the desk in my room.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Then, I picked up a magazine to which my brother had contributed a review,
  which I had left on my desk, and flipped through it.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  This magazine for young people, which collected articles on fashion, movies,
  and music, had a section for film and book reviews, where young critics and
  intellectuals published their reviews every week. My brother wrote one review
  a month on a new novel.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  When it was decided that his article would be published in this magazine, he
  said something like, "It's Oyaji no Nanahikari,". However, I think it must be
  a great achievement for a student to be able to publish such a piece of
  writing in a magazine. Also, it seemed that the reviews written by my brother
  were the most popular in this section, and I, his younger brother, found them
  interesting to read.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I read the magazine until it was time to start cooking dinner and then left
  the room to go to the kitchen.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Just as I started down the stairs, the front door opened. Still unfamiliar, a
  uniform with a cream-colored vest. It was Izumi. She had a school bag slung
  over her shoulder and was taking off her brown leather shoes at the entrance.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Izumi noticed me coming down the stairs and, "Oh, Kenichi-kun. I'm home," she
  said, looking up at me and smiling.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Welcome home," I replied. I went straight into the living room. Izumi put on
  her slippers and went up the stairs.
</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">
  In the Sakamoto household, the division of roles was that my mother cooked
  breakfast and lunch on weekdays and I cooked dinner.
</p>

<p class="calibre6">
  I washed the rice and put it in the rice cooker, peeled the potatoes and
  carrots, and cut them into bite-size pieces. In the middle of the cooking,
  Izumi came downstairs in her loungewear, a loose-fitting T-shirt with a red
  border on a white background, and a pair of soft, navy blue,
  three-quarter-length pants.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Are you making dinner?" she asked me as she came to the kitchen.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  When I answered "yeah,", Izumi said, "If you like, I'll help you." Izumi began
  to tie her hair into a single bun with a pink hair elastic wrapped around her
  wrist.
</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the one on the right</span></p><p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7"><br class="calibre2" /></span></p>
<p class="calibre6">
  When she lifted her hair, a soft smell wafted through the air, and I leaned
  away from Izumi and looked away from her.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "---Then, can I ask you to cut up the rest of the vegetables and meat? I'm
  making curry and salad."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Okey," Izumi nodded, washed her hands in the sink, picked up a knife, and
  began to chop the carrots. I took the cooking utensils and seasonings out of
  the cabinet and put oil in a deep pan to fry the meat.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  As we stood side by side in the small kitchen, our arms occasionally touched
  each other. Each time, we would stop working and give each other space.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Does aunty always come home late?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">Izumi asked as she cut the vegetables in an experienced manner.</p>







<p class="calibre6">
  "Not really, but I think it's most often around 10 p.m. Sometimes she comes
  back around 6 p.m."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "I see. I guess you must be very busy if you are head of a department. Here, I
  have cut the vegetables and meat."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  My mother works for a medium-sized food manufacturer, and she told me that she
  had recently been promoted to head of the department. She is not a workaholic,
  but she often hangs out with people from the company and her life seems to be
  fulfilling in her own way.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I put the meat Izumi had cut up in a pot over the fire and stir-fry it with
  chopsticks. The kitchen is filled with whitish smoke and the savory smell of
  roasting meat.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi-kun, do you cook as often as you do today?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "I'm in charge of weekday dinners. Cause I don't know when mom will be home."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"I see," Izumi said.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  After frying the meat and adding the vegetables and simmering for about twenty
  minutes, the curry powder is added. I took out a plate from the cupboard with
  a glass door on the side of the kitchen and served rice, then poured the curry
  on top of it. I put the cabbage and other vegetables Izumi had cut up on
  another plate, and dinner was ready.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I filled two cups with barley tea and put them on the table. Izumi untied her
  tied hair, and we sat down at the dining table facing each other.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  The living room was quiet because the TV was still off during the meal. The
  sounds of people walking outside and passing cars echoed through the house. We
  ate in silence for a while, and halfway through the meal, Izumi looked at the
  deep pot containing a large amount of leftover curry and said, "Looks like we
  made a little too much."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "We can have it for breakfast tomorrow. It will save you the trouble of
  cooking."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"is it okay, with that?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Yeah. We always did that on the days when we had leftover curry."</p>


<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  We didn't talk much while we ate, but the silence didn't bother me as much as
  it did when we first met. I was a little surprised to find myself already
  getting used to Izumi's presence in my home.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  When I finished my curry, I spoke to Izumi, "I heard you made lunch for me
  today."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">She stopped moving and looked at me with only her eyes.</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Ah, that's right...How was it?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Feeling embarrassed, I replied, "It was delicious." Izumi's cheeks softly
  relaxed and she looked relieved.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "But isn't Izumi busy early in the morning? You don't have to worry too much."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "No. If you make it together, the amount of work will not increase. Aunty and
  I share the cooking task. We seem to wake up at about the same time."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I put my own dishes in the sink, put the salad on a plate, covered it with
  plastic wrap, and put it in the refrigerator to prepare my mother's dinner.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"What kind of work does Izumi's mother do?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">I filled my glass with water, returned to my seat, and asked Izumi.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "She told me she was working for a trading company and was currently importing
  coffee beans."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"That's why she went overseas, huh."</p>







<p class="calibre6">"Yes. She said she is going to work in South America for a while."</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Hee."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I sipped my glass of water while listening to her words. Then Izumi asked me
  about my family.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Kenichi-kun's brother is a graduate student, right? I heard from aunty that
  he writes book reviews for a magazine, is that true?"
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Yeah. He has frequently been writing for magazines for about two years now.
  He said it was our father's influence, our father's fault, or something like
  that. A friend of Dad's at the publishing company gave him a chance to try it
  out, and it turned out to be so good that he got it published in a magazine.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"......Uncle, he was an instructor, wasn't he?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">Knowing my father's situation, Izumi lowered his tone a little.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Yes, he was a teacher in the philosophy department. I heard he specialized in
  French thought, but he died before I could find out what exactly he did, so I
  have no idea what kind of reputation my father's work had."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "I see," Izumi said. Another silence fell. Izumi spooned the rest of the curry
  and ate it, then clasped her hands together and said, "Thanks for the food,".
  Then she put the dishes back in the sink, sat down again, and opened her
  mouth.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"I don't know what kind of man my father is either."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I had never heard about Izumi's family situation. However, I had a vague idea
  that there might be something about her father since she came to our house
  only because her mother was away from home.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I thought it was going to be a bit heavy, but Izumi surprisingly began to talk
  about it without hesitation.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "I heard that they had a quarrel and broke up. It was when I was very young,
  so I don't remember anything about it. I think it's because my mom very
  strong-willed."
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Is that so?"</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  "Yeah. She is very active and likes to keep herself busy with work. The other
  day she said, 'My boyfriend is my work.'"
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Izumi talked about such things with a smiling face. There was nothing shadow
  in her tone of voice or atmosphere.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">"She's amazing."</p>


<p class="calibre6">"Yes. She's the complete opposite of me in personality."</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Today, we had something to talk about. After finishing dinner, Izumi and I
  chatted for a while at the dining room table.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  In the middle of talking with Izumi, my mother came home, and then they
  started talking lively, so I went back to my room. I took a shower when I got
  home, so I decided to leave the first bath to Izumi, and decided to kill some
  time in my room reading a book.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lying on my bed, I slowly turned the pages in the quiet night.</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  When I read, I can tell whether my mental state is in a good or bad mood. When
  I am worried or depressed about something, it is difficult for me to follow
  the words. Perhaps it was because I had just had a lively conversation with
  Izumi, but I was feeling very good today.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  After about 30 minutes of reading in this manner, I soon heard the sound of
  someone's footsteps coming up the stairs. Following that, I heard a door open
  and close nearby. Thinking that Izumi had gotten out of the bath, I took a
  change of clothes from the wardrobe in my room and headed for the bathroom.
</p>







<p class="calibre6">
  As I was taking off my clothes in the changing room with its rubber-like
  flooring, and putting them in the washing machine, I suddenly noticed a
  strangely soft-looking white cloth in the changing basket. At first, I
  couldn't quite make out what the soft, curled-up cloth was, but then I
  recognized that it had something like lace on it and realized, along with a
  sensation of electricity coursing through my brain.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  My heart jumped loudly and I reflexively looked away. The zipper of the
  laundry net was halfway open, and Izumi's, well,...panties were out.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Emptying my mind of the image of Izumi that floated in and out of my
  consciousness, I reached up, careful not to look directly at it, picked up the
  curled-up cloth, was surprised at the shocking softness of the women's
  underwear, placed it in a real lightweight laundry net that I assumed
  contained her complete set of undergarments, and firmly I zipped them up and
  threw them in the washing machine.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  Then I exhaled loudly, as if I was letting out all the air in my chest, took
  off my clothes, and went into the bathroom.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I washed my body and got into the bathtub with a splash. Drops dripped from my
  wet bangs. My heart was still beating a little strongly.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  The more I tried not to think about it, the more the image of Izumi's face and
  the underwear I had just seen came to my mind, and my head felt dizzy. The
  soft sensation of the white underwear still lingered on my fingertips. Picking
  up a pair of panties of a girl my age and putting them in the laundry net, I
  felt like I had acted in a perverted way, thinking back on it.
</p>


<p class="calibre6">
  I had no ulterior motive, I told myself, but as if to symbolize what I was
  feeling, a part of my body was honestly showing that example of physiological
  reaction.
</p>


<p class="calibre6"><i class="calibre9">"Don't put your hand on her."</i></p>


<p class="calibre6">
  My brother's words refrained in my head, "I ain't touching her," I muttered.
  It echoed vaguely in the steamy bathroom.
</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">The next morning, I went into the living room, passing each other with Izumi. She had already put her bag over her shoulder and was leaving the house in her school uniform, which consisted of a skirt just above the knee and navy blue high socks.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good morning," Izumi said as she slipped on her leather shoes at the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It looks like it's going to be hot today. It's going to be over 30 degrees in the afternoon."</p>
<p class="calibre6">The front door of the house had a slit in the polished glass. The light coming through the slit was brighter and whiter than it had been the past few days when the sky had been overcast.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said to Izumi as she put on her shoes and reached for the door, "Have a good day," and she said, "I'm off," and left the house with a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the living room, my mother was also getting ready to go to work, and on the desk was my breakfast and lunch box. I guessed that Izumi and my mother had shared the cooking task again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After my mother left for work, I finished breakfast by myself, washed the dishes for the three of us, locked the door, and left the house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The weather forecast on TV said that it was a sunny day during the rainy season. The clouds in the sky were not gray as they had been until yesterday, but pure white and as thick as cotton candy, giving me a strong feeling that summer was just around the corner.</p>


<p class="calibre6">On this day, I took the day's classes in a lighthearted manner, had lunch with Nagai, and after school, changed into my soccer wear and went out to the field.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Today, two of the twenty-three members of the club were absent, except for the manager (the third-year student had retired after the inter-high qualifying round earlier this month), so when it came time to practice the game, we were short one player to play eleven-on-eleven.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When it came time to divide up the members, we decided that it was okay to play with one person short, and when we were about to start the game with eleven against ten, Yuriko raised her hand and said, "I will join to the team that is short of players."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, okay. Well then, thank you," Nagai, who was in charge of dividing the members, said to Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At her suggestion, the first-year students, including Tachibana, were taken aback.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-senpai, you can play soccer?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana, who was standing next to Yuriko, said in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I played with boys until the sixth grade."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko replied and took one of the bibs from her bib case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Is that so!?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Tachibana looked at Yuriko with an amazed expression. Yuriko half smiled and annoyingly dismissed Tachibana, who said, "Wow, that's great."</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the past, Yuriko had participated in club practices when there were members absent like this, but this was the first time since Tachibana and the others joined the club at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Yuriko was in elementary school, she played on the same boys' soccer team as I did, from first grade through sixth grade. She still occasionally participates in a local women's soccer club. It is said that basic soccer technique is acquired by the age of 12, so her skills are solid. She was also knowledgeable enough to be able to plan practice menus in her place when the advisor teacher isn't around, so she was definitely more of an asset than the inexperienced boys.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After re-braided her hair, which was tied up in one piece with a scrunchie, Yuriko took white plastic leg guards from her own small handbag on the bench and began to get ready.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The club members, having finished their preparations, scatter onto the field. The sound of the track team's starter pistol popping could be heard, as could the sound of the tennis team hitting the ball. After 6 p.m., the sun was setting and it gradually became dim, and the lights on the roof were lit. The western sky, where the sun was setting, was tinged with dark reds and purples, the colors of a summer evening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Our advisor, Nakata-sensei, was away at a staff meeting, so when the thirty minutes were up, Tachibana, on the bench, puffed out her reliance and blew a badly played whistle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After thirty minutes of running around on the field at dusk, we were all sweaty. Yuriko also had a bunch of bangs stuck to her forehead. Sweat was dripping from the tip of her chin as well, and she was wiping her cheeks with her sleeve.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Good work," I said to her as I stood nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko exhaled heavily and said, "Ah, it's so tiring."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Mori-senpai, it's amazing!" said Tachibana, who had been collecting the players' bibs, and came running up to Yuriko.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I didn't know senpai could play soccer like that. It felt like you were better than a first-year reserve! No one can even take the ball from you!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko laughed, "It's not good for a defender to be taken off the ball, is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Why don't you just become a player already?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"As you can expect, if you participate in a serious competition with boys, you will get injured. There's too much of a difference in our physiques, so it's dangerous."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hearing Yuriko and Tachibana's conversation beside me, we returned to the front of the bench. After a short break and cleanup, today's club activities are over. The club members all sit on the ground, stretching their legs, massaging in pairs, and cooling down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I sat down, loosened my spike laces, slipped off my soccer socks, and removed my leg guards. Yuriko sat down near me and did the same, pulling her socks down to her ankles.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With my hands on the sides of my body, I exhaled into the purple-tinged evening sky. The sand on the field was scorching hot after a day of sharp sunlight, but the tender breeze was pleasant. A few black shadows of birds slowly crossed the darkening sky.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The track and field club, who were using the same field--- by the way, the baseball club is using a baseball field that is shared with the softball club--- began to put away their hurdles and other equipment, and the sound of the wind instruments is echoing from the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I turn my head lightly, then fold my knees and stretch my thigh muscles. Then, a piece of gravel flew in from the side and hit me on the leg.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said to Yuriko, who was diagonally behind me, and she said, "Push my back."</p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">T/N :&nbsp;the one on the right</span></p>
<p class="calibre6">She put her legs together and stretched them out in front of her, stretching her calves. I sat up, moved behind Yuriko, and lightly pressed her shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"So weak. A little harder."</p>
<p class="calibre6">As such an order flew in, I pushed her body. Perhaps the force was right, Yuriko let out an "oooh" sound like an old man soaked in a hot spring.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I suddenly remembered that we used to stretch like this when we were in elementary school. Back then, we touched each other's bodies in a more sticky way, but now, as I expected, we were a little more conscious of each other. I was a little embarrassed to look at her curled up back, the shape of the strings of her underwear clearly visible through her sweat-soaked wear.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Even though she was a better soccer player than the boys, the shoulder I was holding was much slenderer than those of the boys I usually help stretch.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Yuriko said, "Thank you," and stopped stretching and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll do it for you too. Sit down."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I did as I was told, sitting on the ground and stretching my legs. She grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me forward. At first, she was gentle, but then she began to push harder and harder.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Hey, that's too hard!"</p>
<p class="calibre6">I screamed in protest as Yuriko pushed me with her weight even though I resisted, and she giggled as I fell to the side to escape her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Gzz.."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I said as I brushed the sand from my arm when I fell, then, "Well, I've got to clean up," she blurted out and scurried over to Tachibana, who was gathering up the scattered balls.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆&nbsp;☆&nbsp;☆</span></p></div>

<p class="calibre6">It was after 7:00 p.m. and Yuriko and I was cycling side by side on our way back to the same neighborhood. We were often accompanied by two or three other members of the soccer club on the way home, but once we entered the residential area where we lived, it was usually just Yuriko and me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">We stopped at a red light. It was the time of day when people were going home, and many cars were on the road.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko said to herself, "I haven't kicked a ball for a while, so my legs feel heavy."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"When was the last time you kicked a ball?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think it's been about two months. I haven't played women's soccer in a while."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It will be myalgia you know, probably."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I think so," she rubbed her thighs over her skirt. Then she turned her head toward me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Kenichi, you've gotten so much better, haven't you?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What's with you all of a sudden? When you praise me like this, I want to read what is the meaning behind it."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You don't have to read it. I felt it when we played together for the first time in a long time. When you had the ball, you were very calm. And you will also observe your surroundings"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Thanks," I said honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"You used to kick the ball out as soon as you got pressure. It looks like you've gotten over that."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I was on the same team as her, I did indeed try to kick the ball forward as soon as I was about to get the ball. If I passed the ball to the back of the opponent, even if they couldn't reach it, we wouldn't be directly pinched. Besides, we had a fast FW who could pick up even a slightly loose ball.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"My dad also said that I made you run too much. If you put it that way, it's true that it's been a habit of mine for a long time."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko laughed but was a little proud of herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"It was fairly difficult. We had to sprint again and again, and we sometimes collided with the enemy in the middle of chasing. I was probably the hardest worker on that team."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Maybe," I nodded in nostalgia, thinking back to my elementary school days.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As our conversation trailed off, I let out a single breath, as if to exhale the day's exhaustion. I looked up at the pale blue sky with barely a trace of sunlight remaining in the west. Thin gray clouds were floating in the dark gradient of the evening sky, and white stars were appearing in the gaps between them. As I gazed at it in a daze, Yuriko muttered something.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"...... Come to think of it, next month will be three years since Oji-san passed away."</p>
<p class="calibre6">A truck drove in front of us, making a loud noise. The smell of exhaust fumes lingered around for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko stared straight ahead at the traffic light. When I turned my head to the side, I saw a slender curve from her chin to her throat and her eyelashes curled slightly upward. Yuriko's face looked familiar, but when I stared at her profile again, I felt as if it belonged to someone I didn't know. Like earlier when we were stretching, I suddenly felt Yuriko's feminine side strongly again. I don't know why.---I don't know why, but somewhere in my heart, I had the feeling that it was because of Izumi.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oji-san, he wasn't very good at playing soccer, but he was very good at teaching."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko turned her face toward me and said with a somewhat mischievous expression on her face. My father, who had been a volunteer to coach the boys' team in elementary school, had taught us the basics of soccer when we were both in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"He was a college teacher, so I guess he was used to teaching others."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Yuriko nodded with a smile and said, "Maybe."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, the traffic light turned green.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With the chain clanking, we started pedaling our bicycles. A little later, we arrived at Yuriko's house. It is a house with a small garden, just like mine. The house is surrounded by brick blocks.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Bye."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Yuriko waved one hand as she got off her bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Okay. See you tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre6">I said that to Yuriko and cycled on for a while. It took me about five minutes to get from Yuriko's house to mine by bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I arrived at the street where my house is located, I saw two figures in front of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At first, it was too dark to see them clearly, but when I got closer, I saw that the figures were Izumi. Beside her was a short, serious-looking girl in the same uniform, wearing glasses and with her hair tied back in two.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, Kenichi-kun," Izumi said to me as I got off my bicycle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Izumi... Did you just get home?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Yes," she nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The girl beside her, perhaps shy, squirmed and hid behind Izumi as we exchanged words. The girl is wearing the same uniform as Izumi. I didn't recognize her, but the fact that she was with Izumi on her way home at this time of the day suggested that she also lived in this area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"......Um, Rina-chan, do you know each other?"</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, yeah. His name is&nbsp; Sakamoto Kenichi......."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi started to introduce me to the girl. Without thinking, I reflexively opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm a relative of Izumi's. I live near here."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eh? Izumi's mouth dropped open.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I-I see."</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/61dwfjm/000003.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre6">The girl said, still fidgeting. Then, "My name is Hoshino Aiko. Nice to meet you," She bowed her head as if to escape my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Oh, hello...," I said, scratching my head. I'm a shy person myself, so I understand the uncomfortable feeling that Hoshino-san must be feeling right now.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"See you later, Izumi."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then I got on my bike and started riding again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Eh, ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi looked at me with a confused and troubled expression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I rode around the residential area for a while, circled the house, and then parked my bicycle in the front yard, making sure that Izumi's friends were gone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At that moment, I was sure that Izumi was going to tell her friend, Hoshino-san, that she was living with me. For some reason, I felt like she shouldn't do that and had reacted that way instantly. On second thought, it's possible that she had already told her friend that there were boys her age at the place she was moving to. I wondered if I had done anything unnecessary.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm home."</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I took off my shoes and entered the living room, Izumi, who was sitting at the table, gave me a troubled look and immediately spoke to me.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'm sorry, Kenichi-kun. I feel like I made you feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"No... Me too. I was acting out of reflex. I thought that if we explained to that person that we were living together, it might be a hassle....... But if she was a good friend of Izumi's, we might as well have told her."</p>
<p class="calibre6">I remembered Yuriko. I was hiding Izumi from her at first, but that had gotten me into a bit of trouble later on. If that girl was a trusted friend of Izumi's, it might not have been a good idea for me to pretend to be someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When I said this, Izumi shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I'll explain everything to her next time we have an opportunity like this, don't worry. She's not the type of girl who's going to go around talking about that kind of stuff in a weird way."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I see."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi nodded. Then, as if to change the atmosphere,</p>
<p class="calibre6">"What are you going to make for dinner tonight?" She said cheerfully.</p>
<p class="calibre6">"Ah, let me see. We had minced meat in the fridge, I was thinking of making a hamburg steak or something..."</p>
<p class="calibre6">"I understand. I'll help you then. I'm going to get dressed, so just wait for me."</p>
<p class="calibre6">Izumi said this and left the living room. It was already dark outside, and the surface of the window glass reflected the lighted living room like a mirror. I closed the curtains and went back to my room to get dressed too.</p>
