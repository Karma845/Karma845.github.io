<h1>Afterwords</h1>

<p class="calibre6">The prototype text for this work was written last year, in July 2015. After finishing the previous work, I had a meeting with the editor in charge of the project and proposed several ideas, and the one that was chosen was the idea of a modern-day youth novel with the theme of cohabitation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Cohabitation is a theme that has been used in various genres of narrative content for a long time. Since it is a very classic and common theme, I tried not to make it sound old-fashioned and tried to describe the everyday life we are living now in the language we use in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I especially like to read the "descriptive" parts of novels, which have the function of making the usually unremarkable reality that we are usually tired of seeing seem fresh again. I wrote this work, which is set in the modern day in which we live, while dreaming that when the reader looks up from the book, the scenery he or she sees in the eyes of those who read it will look somewhat different.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There is a unique pleasant feeling that comes with reading a text. In many cases, it is possible to explain why I was deeply moved by a story (because the characters overcame great difficulties, because the foreshadowing of unexpected events comes into play later in the story, etc.), but the sensation I get from reading the story itself, other than saying, "This part is really good," seems to be more difficult to explain. I think it is very difficult to explain.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nowadays, narrative patterns and structures have already been studied quite a bit, and as a method, they are organized in a very practical way. However, even so, there are still infinite variations in the way details are described, and I believe that creating an atmosphere unique to the work is also necessary for writing an interesting novel.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I would be very happy if you, the reader, could feel such joyful moments.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The following are my acknowledgments.</p>
<p class="calibre6">I would like to thank N-san, the editor in charge of this project, for his great help once again. Also, to Kazuharu Kina-san for wonderful and modern illustrations with a great sense of style. I am very grateful to you for taking time out of your busy schedule to do the illustrations for this work. To the novelists with whom I am in close contact, thank you very much for your thoughts and impressions. If you have a chance, please let me know what you think.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre6">And to our readers. Thank you for reading this far. As long as circumstances permit, I intend to continue writing this novel as far as I originally planned.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Well then, that's all for this time. See you again.</p>
