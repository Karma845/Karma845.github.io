 <h3>Interlude</h3>

<p class="calibre4">I had a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dream that felt strangely real, as if it were digging deep into my memories.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a bright room, there was me, a little younger than I am now, and a little girl who looked a lot like Fujiwara, together with a beautiful lady whose entire body was radiating light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was physically, not metaphorically, glowing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She wore a white cloth loosely wrapped around her body and nothing more. The outfit emphasized her gorgeous figure, which could be described as voluptuous, but she looked more divine than s**y.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if she was a goddess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a summoning formation shining in purple beneath her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Did I ever summon someone like her in the past?</p>
<p class="calibre4">The younger me was appealing to the goddess for something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“To this girl… Chikage-chan, I want you to bestow her with the talent of a great magician. I want her to have a perfect talent so that she can do anything without being defeated by anyone. Please… give her the power that no one can stand in the way of. Please… I’ll give you anything if you can make it happen.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman, who had been smiling and quietly listening to my plea, nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then, for some reason, she held my hand…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My whole body convulsed, and I woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked around warily and found myself in my room, shrouded in darkness, lying on the couch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha…? Hah, hah… A nightmare…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wiped the sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The memory of what happened before I fell asleep returned to me, and I realized that I was having a nightmare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nearby was the demoness lying in bed, snoozing in her sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I breathed a sigh of relief. Nothing had changed from what I remembered before going to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That was a strange dream, but it’s kinda embarrassing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">For the sake of little Fujiwara, I was pleading… how could that be?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was she ever my childhood friend…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t think I’d want that, but whatever it was, it was like a delusion that stemmed from self-sacrifice and heroism.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sheer shift from reality made me itchy! It was embarrassing!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was squirming like a caterpillar, I saw the demoness, or rather, Sophia, looking at me with disturbing eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah. I’m sorry, did I wake you up?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, That’s okay. Is something wrong? You don’t look so good.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I had a weird dream, and it was embarrassing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I see. Well, I won’t ask too much… Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia nodded as if she remembered something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did the dream involve your younger self with Chikage Fujiwara, My Lord?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was flabbergasted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How do you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;Because I share memories with Chikage Fujiwara. A few days ago, you woke up in the middle of the night and complained to her about a nightmare you had.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I don’t remember any of that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Oh, that’s right. Your memories from that time were erased. Hmm. It seems like a curse!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What were you talking about?</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I couldn’t understand the meaning of the words, the demoness said, “It is often hard to have a good sleep in such a cramped bed. Come this way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The demoness stuffed herself on the edge of the bed and indicated the open space.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no, that’s not quite right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Perhaps are you embarrassed? It’s nothing to be concerned about, My Lord. I dedicated myself to you. If you want to, I’m ready to accept all of you,” Sophia smiled seductively…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, wah, well, I don’t know what you mean at all, but I’ll have to pass…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I said that, I wrapped myself in the blanket, and then she sneered, “You waster.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not. I’m not someone whose morals are low enough to do such a thing to a familiar with a restricted free will. Let me tell you something, Sophia. Right now, you’re currently brainwashed due to the influence of the Mark of Obedience. You don’t have to belittle or either restrain yourself for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hou. But My Lord, you once tried to steal Chikage Fujiwara’s lips.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you please stop dusting off the black history of high school boys at their most sensational age?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. However, in any case, this lady is not subjected to brainwashing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia pointed at the mark on her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Perhaps because it was hastily prepared in the first place, some of its additional functions aren’t working. The brainwashing My Lord is talking about is one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">You see, Chikage Fujiwara verbally abused you on a daily basis, even sometimes physically. Do you really think a brainwashed person would do that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was so convincing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But wasn’t that actually pretty bad?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, there were hardly any restraints left on Sophia. However, I’m sure the power of obedience, which is the foundation of the Mark, was still functioning, so I should be able to ask her for the favour when the time comes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sigh. Whatever it was, it’s heavy. I didn’t want to think about anything else now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now that you know I truly adore you, come here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I will not. I’m fine here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My head felt like it was going to explode, so I chose to sleep for the time being in order to escape from all the problems.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Sophia persisted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No! You seem to think that you are an insignificant speck of dust, but that is the incorrect perception of yourself. For example, My Lord, you’re very wise…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! I don’t really care about that. Let’s go to bed instead of talking nonsense.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You mean the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia giggled slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, whatever the Lord says, this lady has already made up her mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“About what?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I will make you the king of this world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I see. She’s the ambitious type.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said something so outlandish and ridiculous that I lost interest in dealing with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord is born to rule this world. After all, you’re the one I chose to serve. My Lord, you’re born with such a destiny. And for this lady at your command, this lowly world is no big deal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, but I need to get some sleep, or I’ll be sick tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I see. We’ll talk about it later.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right. Well, good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good night, My Lord.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The conversation was cut short, and soon my consciousness faded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time, various memories seemed to disappear as well… Argh…</p>
