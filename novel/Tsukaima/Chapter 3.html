<h2 class="calibre2">Chapter 3 &#8211; It Has To Be You</h2>

<p class="calibre4">When I walked out of the school building after my class, the sky was filled with thick clouds.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It looked like it was going to rain at any moment, and I wondered whether I had seen a headline on the news site I visited about the start of the rainy season.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was probably going to rain today, though, since it was the middle of June.</p>
<p class="calibre4">More than two months have passed since the summoning test, and it’s been over half a month since Fujiwara’s body got taken over by the demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I better hurry up.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The weather definitely looked like it was about to start raining, so I hurriedly headed for the courtyard where we were meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps because of the unsettled sky, there was only one student there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was Misa.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was sitting on a bench, playing with her smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, did I keep you waiting?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I called out to her, she glanced at me and immediately returned her gaze to her phone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not waiting for you at all. I’m sorry, but I’m in the middle of an event. Please wait a moment…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She then quickly tapped and flicked the screen with both her index finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sat down next to her and peered at her screen. I saw a 3D model of a girl dancing to music.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was playing a music game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This girl has always loved games, and as expected, her enthusiasm hadn’t cooled down yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After waiting several minutes, Misa let out a big sigh and looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. Thank you for waiting!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she smiled at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, what do you want from me? Calling me out in the courtyard like this… Perhaps you’re gonna confess your love to me? All right, that’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You idiot. I’d like to pay back my points. You can check!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took out my phone, opened the points management app and transferred the points to Misa’s account.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa, who was also operating her phone, peeled her eyes away in horror.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uwawawa… Sota-san? 30,000 points were transferred to my account at once…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I paid it off in full. Fortunately, or I should say unfortunately, questing has gotten a whole lot easier lately.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I see, by sacrificing Fujiwara-san the other day, you got a great familiar. That would make questing a lot easier, wouldn’t it? Indeed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re being too harsh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nevertheless, Misa’s comment was a clear expression of my current reputation at the school. Even if it wasn’t intentional, the wind was still strong against me for abandoning Fujiwara and getting a powerful demon as a familiar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My current position in the school was really bad. It was even more so because I had defeated Ryouka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, that’s to be expected when a small fry with no faction knocks out the East and West leaders of the second grade.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nevertheless, that demoness is very useful. I can finish most quests by just throwing her at it. I don’t even have to do anything at all. She’s like a cheat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You cheater! So, where is this demoness? I can’t see her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa looked around, but there was no sign of Sophia nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She’s inspecting the school today. Also, she can manipulate the magic in the air and procure it on her own, so unlike Fujiwara, she doesn’t care if I leave the supply circuit’s range. That’s why she can do whatever she wants.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This has caused me a lot of problems with many students, and it has ruined my reputation like a broken elevator wire. Well, with my pleading, they have been behaving somewhat more moderately lately, but… The reputation that was ruined had not returned, as it should.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa!? She can procure her own magic power? Isn’t that just insanely dangerous?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa said, shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh man, this is so f*cked up. It’s so crazy. I can’t even imagine it. Isn’t that out of the norm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hue…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa raised her voice in a distracted tone as if she had just heard an unbelievable story.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I understand that feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So. Well, let me get to the point.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes. What is it? I, Misa-chan, will work my a*s off for you, Sota-chan!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s encouraging. Then, can you make a magic device that can retract Sophia’s personality?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? Hmm, that’s impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a normal refusal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We stared at each other in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Well… Fujiwara’s consciousness hasn’t come out since the incident. In other words, her body and personality are stuck as Sophia’s. But for me, it’s more convenient to have Fujiwara as the person in control…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I can’t do that even if you ask me. In the first place, will she allow me to do a physical examination to make the device? She’s not going to let me do that, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… If you were to ask me, she wouldn’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa gave me a half-hearted look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right? But there’s one thing that I’d like to know first, Sota, do you like Fujiwara-san? ”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha!? No? How did you come to that conclusion? Is your brain made of pudding?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t like her, then there’s no benefit in waking her up, right? Sophia-san is stronger when she’s in control, no? Is there any reason for you to choose Fujiwara-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Too much strength is also a problem. I’m like the little monkey on Monkey Mountain with a bomb. Does a monkey need that kind of strength? No, he doesn’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh. But if you say that, Fujiwara-san is also very strong, right? So it’s the same no matter which side is on the front. After that, it’s just a matter of preference.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I even used metaphors, but I couldn’t shift the argument. I felt like an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it’s not like I’m really hiding anything, so it’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Of course, there’s more reasons than that. And there are actually three.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The first thing, the scary people in the Fujiwara family are going to kill me. They were already irritated, and now that Fujiwara’s consciousness had disappeared, they were furious. They can assassinate any moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s very disturbing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know, killing me won’t solve anything… And the second thing is, that demoness is simply dangerous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How dangerous?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. That woman seems to be going to conquer the world with force and make me the world president.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa looked at me with a straight face with a “Ha?” as if she’s been told a boring joke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when I didn’t say anything and just looked back at her, she snorted, “Yeah, that’d be super hilarious…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She’s serious. She did a lot of research on the internet and started talking about what facilities to attack first. Then she started saying that she could control that country by herself… I should have not given her that tablet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My words of regret were met with a “haha” from Misa, who burst into laughter as if she had heard the joke of the century.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha! Oh, no, that’s too bad! Aah! Sota, are you going to become the World President? Faa! Yikes! Sota!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She slapped her knees and looked at me with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… is no laughing matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no, Sota, hahaha! I’m not sure what to say. World President! You look like a fool! What kind of elementary school kid made that up?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if she had gotten the point, Misa burst out laughing and even started coughing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Cough… Cough, I laughed too much. But still… This is too amusing!! If you really become the World President, will you marry me? I’m fine being a concubine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“S***w that. That’s why I asked if you could make a device that would prevent that from happening.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh… Haha. I’m sure it’s difficult. And what about the last one?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With teary eyes, Misa asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wasn’t sure if I should be honest. The last one was a little different from the previous ones. But after all this time, I thought it wouldn’t be a good idea to hide things, so I decided to come clean.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know, that Fujiwara… Just before I lost consciousness, Fujiwara said something like she had to protect me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, so when… we were cornered by Ryouka, Fujiwara probably surrendered her body to Sophia-san of her own volition. And that’s what she said.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that time, Fujiwara was definitely begging from Sophia, who was sleeping inside her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That girl who was like a lump of pride was only trying to protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Hmm. I guess she loves you more than I thought.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? It’s not love. That’s disgusting. I’ve never done anything to be loved at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I replied to Misa, who said in a strangely low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, abandoning Fujiwara after being rescued like that…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’d be nothing but scum, but now you sound like a real human being. Yes, all right, I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa crossed her arms and wrinkled her brow with a “hmmm” and a serious expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“However, I think it is still difficult. I want to help you Sota, but I can’t do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, right. No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m sorry I couldn’t live up to your expectations either… Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She suddenly raised her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just remembered something I wanted to say. A while ago, we talked about how Fujiwara-san’s failure in the exam might have been caused by a third party, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah, there was that story.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’d forgotten all about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa looked around and quietly put her mouth close to my ear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think I may have found the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Who?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just a small guess, but if there is a culprit, it’s most likely…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa’s voice trailed off further, and she grinned in amusement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Marika Sanjo, the Student Council President.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I know it’s a little late, but I’d like to give a brief explanation about Marika Sanjo.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Marika Sanjo was born as the eldest daughter of the head of the Sanjo family, a famous family of magicians, and she is one of the leading magicians of our generation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She is brilliant, and her talent shines inside out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her talent as a magician attracted attention not only in the Sanjo family but also from Japan as a whole. And for some time now, she was known in the Japanese magician circles as the Prodigy of the West, Marika Sanjo, like Prodigy of the East, Chikage Fujiwara.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The term ‘gifted person’ was truly the most appropriate for her. She had both the talent and integrity to take it for granted. It was unanimously agreed that she will eventually become the leader of the magician world.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She is an existence that no ordinary person could ever reach, a person that stood above others atop the clouds, favoured by God.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Such a person took the trouble to interfere with Fujiwara.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It’s hard to believe, but… hmm?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh. Are you studying?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was reading an academic book on the art of summoning demons in the library when I was approached by a voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked up and saw the student council president, Marika Sanjo, looking at me with a soft smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was somewhat panicked by the timely encounter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah, yes. Are you studying on your own too, President?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I asked in a low voice so as not to disturb the other users, she shook her head, “No,” and said,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I was patrolling the school. Then I found Sota-kun. Do you mind if I sit next to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I nodded, and she pulled out a chair and sat down right beside me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I’m sorry about the other day. I’d like to apologize again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s fine. I had Ryouka apologize to me the other day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, right, I guess it would have been rude to be too persistent. Hmm. By the way, what are you studying? I can try to help you with what I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She peeked at the academic book. As her trademark ponytail swayed, a pleasant smell tickled my nostrils. The lustre of her hair was probably thanks to how she took care of it daily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s about a summoner’s magic circuit. I’m trying to find out if it’s possible to bring Fujiwara back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">President twitched and shook her shoulders at my words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Maybe it was because I overheard Misa’s speculation. Usually, I wouldn’t think anything of such trivial behaviour, but I suspected there was more to it. Was it information bias, or did it bother her?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t think I can find anything by doing research in the library, but I thought I should do what I can… Oh, that’s right. What did the President think about the accident that happened during the summoning test?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I tried probing her here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She folded her arms and muttered,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“The truth is that I don’t really know. It’s hard to believe that Fujiwara-san made such an easy mistake. The grimoire, the magic formula, and the summoning team were all carefully examined in advance by the school, right? If that’s the case, it’s my opinion that the accident could not have happened in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see. Then it was an intentional, or in other words, man-made accident?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She stared at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I don’t know why, but her expression was unnatural. She also seemed a little stiff.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Do you believe that the accident was staged by someone else?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes. Fujiwara complained about it before. She said she didn’t make any mistakes. At first, it sounded like she was merely grumbling, but recently, I started to think that maybe she was telling the truth. If that’s the case, the only thing that could have caused the accident would have been interference from others, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I can’t deny the possibility, but…”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Right? So, if it was a set-up, who do you think was the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">President fell silent as if she was searching for my intentions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Silence filled the room for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Eventually, she turned her face down loosely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You… No, I suppose not. If you think about it normally, the people who would benefit from Fujiwara-san’s disappearance would be suspicious. That would be the upper echelons of the East Branch, who would gain relative status by kicking her out, or someone from the West Branch, who is completely hostile to the East. However, the upper echelons of the East Branch within the university generally have a good relationship with her, and it is hard to imagine them undermining her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re familiar with the inner workings of the East. If that’s the case, does that mean that it’s the people from the West who are suspicious? “</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes, that’s right. The most likely candidates are Ryouka, who regularly fights with Fujiwara-san, and me, who controls the West faction. But Ryouka doesn’t have the control to mess with Fujiwara-san’s grimoire. It’s the wrong field. In other words, the most suspicious person would be me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She said without hesitation and smiled provocatively.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What do you think? Perhaps, but Sota-kun was thinking something similar, wasn’t he? It was like you were testing me there and then. You wouldn’t deny it, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She saw right through me. Well, that was Misa’s guess, not mine, but since she’s blabbing on like a criminal in a suspense drama, I won’t deny it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But if I were to give her an unreasonably antagonistic reply, she’ll misunderstand me, and I’ll end up blowing myself up. Idiot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I smiled falsely to distract myself from the awkwardness.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I mean, yes. So I’m going to ask you instead, are you the culprit?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re asking that directly to me? What can I say? … Hmm. If so, what would you do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I thought for a moment about how to reply, but the answer quickly came to mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m not going to do anything. There’s nothing I can do now that I know who did it. But I would like to know why you did it, though. To prevent it from happening again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s surprising. Don’t you want to get even?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It was Fujiwara that got targeted. I was just involved, and I have no intention of doing that. Even if I got revenge, it’s not like Fujiwara will be back to normal. Besides, you’re too strong.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see. You’re very rational.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I’m not. I’m a lazy person. I’m not motivated in most things. So, why did you tamper with Fujiwara’s grimoire? Did you intend to kill her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I asked, and she chuckled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re assuming that I’m the culprit, aren’t you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“If you aren’t, say so firmly. I’ll rub my forehead on the floor and apologize.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I told her with half-certainty, based on our exchanges so far.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She crossed her arms and looked up at the ceiling.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KF47nWN/000007.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You can’t look me straight in the eye like that… It’s like you’re telling me that I’m a very foolish creature for thinking so much and fooling around.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She smiled, which was unusual for her as if she was throwing something away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I did. I tampered with Fujiwara-san’s grimoire stored in the school and sabotaged her exam. I’m still trusted by the faculty, after all. It was easy for me to play safe… Oh, no, I confessed. I didn’t particularly want Sota-kun to know about it…”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You admitted it surprisingly easy for someone like you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I didn’t think I could hide it anyway. I was willing to admit it if it came to light, and now it has. I can’t do anything about it. So, what are you going to do with me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She held up her hands as if to give up. I guess that meant that she gave up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Anyway, weren’t you listening to what I was saying?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m not going to do anything about it. It’s too much trouble, so I won’t even tell Fujiwara.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Eh? What, you’re not serious?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes, I am. More importantly, why did you do that? I was under the impression that you didn’t like this kind of trickery. Tricks, sabotage, that kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes, these means are not what I wanted. However, I had no other choice but to do this. If I tell you my motive, you won’t understand it, but to put it simply, Fujiwara-san tried to summon a familiar that was out of her capabilities, and I personally couldn’t allow it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Not capable enough? Why not? Fujiwara is talented, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Her talent is borrowed. It’s not the one that she should have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The President looked at me as if she was looking somewhere far away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I stared at her, unable to understand, she smiled gently at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“The truth is, Chikage Fujiwara doesn’t actually have a great talent. It is not a biased opinion based on my rivalry or jealousy, but a cold hard fact. No one except us will ever understand it, but the dazzling talent she possesses today is something that should have belonged to someone else. In other words, she’s cheating. She is using a borrowed talent and acting as if she was born with it. I couldn’t forgive her for that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t understand what she meant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I chewed and swallowed her words one by one, but all I could hear was envy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well… So you’re saying you can’t stand the fact that Fujiwara is more talented than you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Why would I think that? As expected, it’s impossible for you to understand… No, it wasn’t something you could understand as long as the explanation was abstract in any way…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are you trying to make me understand this in the first place? I don’t understand what you mean.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m telling you I can’t go into detail because if I do, you’ll forget it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Do you think I’m stupid? I’m not that forgetful.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There is no such thing as a fool. In fact, I respect you, Sota-kun. You’ve got much better qualities than Fujiwara or me… You sure have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Seriously? Aren’t I too awesome?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I just let it go. She started saying weird things again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She’s also so bad at flattery it’s funny.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t feel like dealing with her at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, anyway, the culprit is the President, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Yeah, I accept that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It seems that Misa’s guess was correct.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see. So, please don’t do that again. I’m in trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s light. If I may say so, are you sure you want to do that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t know how Fujiwara feels about it. I just don’t want any more trouble. Oh, and while we’re on the subject, do you have any guesses on how to get Fujiwara back to her original form?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There’s nothing I can think of…”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“As expected.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I muttered and turned my attention back to the academic book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Then, she started to look at me restlessly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You really don’t think anything of what I’ve done, do you? You’re not going to do anything about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Umm, are you trying to get me angry? If so, I’ll be…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, no, that’s not what I mean… I see…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She smiled sardonically as if her tension was no more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmm, well, okay, I get it. Then, let me at least help you bring Fujiwara-san back to normal, okay? If there’s anything I can do, I’ll do it. Don’t hesitate to ask me. I don’t think that will atone for the sins of this time, but… at least I can do that much, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s a great help. I’ll be happy to discuss with you as soon as I can if I need anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I can’t shake the feeling that it’s weird, though, since she’s the one who caused this in the first place…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Well, I guess I can count on her.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>



<p class="calibre4">As the library was about to close, I went back to the dorm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">By the way, other than the President’s support, I had no success. I knew it was obvious, but it’s still frustrating to have no results.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My Lord. Welcome back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I entered the room, I found a beautiful woman sitting on the bed, playing with a tablet.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked like the personification of a scarlet flame, the Empress of Hellfire.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My current familiar, and the worst stressor in my life,</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia Edel Eilam.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It had been half a month since Fujiwara had been replaced by her, yet I still couldn’t get used to this woman.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t shake the feeling of discomfort no matter how many times I saw the sight of an alien beauty existing in this room as if it were a matter of course. It was not the case with Fujiwara, but it seems that there is a limit to everything.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia made eye contact with me and smiled.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Combined with the luxurious furniture Fujiwara had brought in, I felt as if I was in an old castle in Northern Europe. It really was quite a sight. And it would be perfect if what she was holding was not a tablet but some hard-cover book. Well, whatever.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m back. Are you surfing the net again? At this rate, you’ll damage your eyes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to get nearsighted. Besides, the memories of Chikage Fujiwara are not enough to give me a good knowledge of this world. I don’t know much about anything, especially military matters. What negligence! It’s the most important knowledge the Lord needs. What a little girl.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia continued to complain, but learning about military knowledge is not needed in my life in the slightest. Instead, I felt that my life would be much better spent learning about the manufacturing techniques of hand creams popular with women.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I gave her a half-hearted nod, and Sophia put the device on the bed and faced me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, my Lord. I’m sorry to bother you so soon after your return, but do you have a moment?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. What is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, I’m thinking of putting my plan into action.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Plan? What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t feign ignorance! I’m talking about world domination.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahh… That…? Do you want to put it into action?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I asked her, Sophia nodded.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course, it’s too early to make any major moves, but I thought I’d take control of the school, for now, just to get you accustomed to the idea. I’ve been inspecting the academy for the past few days, and it seems that the Lord can easily take control of it. Well, we’d better hurry up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If we can defeat the student body president, we can take control of this school, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That was not how our country’s educational institutions are structured. It isn’t some wild kingdom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, wait. Defeating the student body president? That… Umm… If you want to be the head of the school, there’s a student council election that you have to win.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What, you don’t know? Wait a minute. Uh, I think this is it, I guess?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia picked up the tablet and swiftly operated it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turned to the screen to see the information she was looking for, where some of the school’s rules were displayed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It brought back memories of when I had just entered the school and when I vaguely skimmed through the student handbook.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh my god, there are rules like this? Jeez…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was a section on selecting student council officers other than through elections.</p>

<p class="calibre4">To put it bluntly, student council members could be changed outside of elections through the president’s power to remove and appoint them. Since the president’s position was also included in this category, they were free to reappoint the student council, but only during their term.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a true dictatorship. Is that what you want, student council? Where’s democracy?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In short, the plan is to force the current president to accept the Lord as the new student body president.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not a beast. What do you think intelligence is for?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean? It is the natural order of things that a handful of strong and talented elected officials should rule over the masses. It is only under a superior ruler that the fools can enjoy true happiness.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m one of those fools.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re being so modest. We’re going to conquer this world sooner or later, but not without defeating the school president first. If you know what you’re doing, you should prepare for it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There’s no way I could do that. Isn’t that a coup d’etat?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Our values were so fundamentally different that we couldn’t even talk about them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In this day and age, do you really want to go that far to take over the world? Think about it calmly. You don’t need it, do you?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I mean, based on the premise, I don’t think the President would agree to a match.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Worry not. I’ll take care of that. And even if the negotiations fail, the worst that can happen is killing her on the spot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You can’t do that. You’ll be arrested by the police.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I will kill them too? Government officials are nothing to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Too bad they’ll just send in the army or a task force from the association.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll kill them all. Would you rather go with the flow and rule the country as it is? The ruler is the law. Anyway, tomorrow I will declare war. If so, we’ll duel on the spot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, wait. It’s crazy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not crazy, and I won’t wait. I said I would make you the king. You can rest assured and watch in peace, my Lord.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t see any element of assurance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After that, the discussion continued on a parallel track, but I didn’t give up and kept trying to persuade her against it until late at night, but… it didn’t go well. In fact, I ended up being the one lectured.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This is what I meant by not listening.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can only hope that the President can somehow push Sophia away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m sure she can do something about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yes, she can… I hope so.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre4">The next day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The homeroom teacher finished the homeroom class as the chime rang to announce the end of the school day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As the classroom suddenly came to life, I stood up quietly, hiding my presence.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The plan was to get out of here before Sophia made any moves. It was a passive response to postpone the problem, but it had to be done.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was nothing else I could do.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I excused myself and took a step forward, only to be quickly grabbed by the wrist.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turned around and saw Sophia looking at me with a thin smile on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Where do you think you’re going?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, to the restroom.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Well, I’ll go too. I have to escort you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… No need. I no longer need to.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Then let’s go to the student council room for the duel.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Resistance is futile being at the mercy of an uncompromising hardliner…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Of course, the Mark of Obedience could be used to stop this outburst. However, doing so would surely provoke a strong reaction from Sophia. Considering the possibility that it may harm our current relationship, I have to avoid it as much as possible. It was not the time to use it yet.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Of course, this was true even after Fujiwara was restored back to normal.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tried using the cattle prodding tactic but got forced back to the path and soon reached the student council room. [EN: Cattle prodding as in trying to go off-path.]</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia didn’t take a moment to let me catch my breath and opened the door with all her might.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is the student council president here?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Marika Sanjo, the president of the student council, was at the back of the room, boringly looking through documents.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was no sign of the other members. Perhaps they hadn’t arrived yet because classes had just ended, or maybe they hadn’t planned to gather in the first place. Considering what we were about to discuss, it would be better if there were no unnecessary outsiders.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What an unusual visitor.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">President looked surprised at our arrival, but she quickly smiled and said, “Have a seat,” offering us a chair in the reception set.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thinking about the ridiculous story we were about to tell, the welcoming mood was tormenting.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia, on the other hand, sat down uninterested in such subtleties. I had no choice but to sit down next to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president asked as she sat down in front of us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. It’s not much. You’ll be resigning as student body president.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia said without hesitation as if it were a given.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was so natural that there was no sense of irreverence or arrogance, in contrast to the content of the message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As expected, the president looked like she didn’t quite understand what she had just heard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Looks like you’re not very understanding. Since you’re not strong enough, My Lord said that he would personally rule this school in your place. In simpler terms, I’m having you step down and assign My Lord as the next student council president. This lady (Sophia) will be appointed as the vice president as well.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was insane and crazy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president looked at me, troubled.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you here to fight me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In a roundabout way, yes. Honestly, I’m not keen on it, but she insisted.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why is My Lord still so reluctant? Don’t you have the guts as a man?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She shouted right next to me, jarring my brain.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Stop it. What would you do if my eardrum popped out?</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president crossed her arms at our exchange.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It seems that only the familiar is getting ahead of herself… Why do you want to force him to become president when he doesn’t want to? I’d like to hear your reasons.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia scoffed at the president, who kept her calm demeanour.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You want to know why? How foolish. It is the justice of all creatures for the best to rule the herd. I have no intention of following anyone inferior to me, and there is no one else that qualifies my following but My Lord. Therefore, you must lower your head and hand over your position to My Lord. Let me make this clear. The weak must obey the strong.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Though primitive logic, it was also simple and clear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The President nodded her head and said, “I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a simple argument. But I can’t accept it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Hou?” Sophia lifted one edge of her lips in mockery. “Are you insane?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I am sane. You can’t run an organization if you have to carefully consider every individual’s wishes. I indeed have the right to appoint and dissolve the current student council. But that is something that should only be used for the renewal. Not for self-promotion. We, the student council, are appointed by the whole school, and such&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president’s explanation was interrupted by Sophia’s laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that the way of the weak!? You seem to be mistaken, but this lady can defeat this whole school by herself. In other words, I’m stronger and better than everyone in this school except My Lord! Why should I follow the arguments of you weaklings? Heh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Monsterous claimers at their best.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president let out a sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s the rules. If you really want him to be the student council president, you’ll have to wait until next term’s election. If I nominate him, he will surely be elected, and there may be some animosity, but it’s unlikely that there will be any backlash.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s absurd. I can’t wait that long. You are saying that, at this very moment, My Lord and this lady are still under the control of a lowly one’s power, and I cannot accept that fact. How much more foolish do you have to be?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. I’m not going to listen to what you have to say. As the head of the school, it is impossible for me to set a standard for the students without following the rules. I’m sorry, but you have to give up. That’s all I have to say.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president stood up, turned her back on us and went back to her desk with documents spread out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was relieved to see her resolute and uncompromising attitude. I was glad that she had said no.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I patted myself on the chest, Sophia spat out, “You are an irredeemable woman.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You really didn’t learn anything, did you? It is because of this attitude that you lost the one you cherished the most to Chikage Fujiwara in the past. Are you really that stupid to think that nothing will change after that incident?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Pitter-patter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president stopped in her tracks.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What is it? Something disturbing was in the air…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia sneered.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll tell you something good. I share memories with Chikage Fujiwara, so I know everything that happened in the past. E-ve-ry-thing. Hmm? How do you feel now?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shut up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president, who was unprovoked until then, let out a small yelp.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As if a dark cloud was gathering, a horrible feeling filled me. What the h**l was Sophia talking about?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia continued on with an evil smile on her face, befitting the name of a demoness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you regret having your beloved snatched away by some unknown woman who came after you? Heh, don’t tell me… Were you convinced? Certainly, the agreement between the Sanjo and Fujiwara families must have been significant to the young you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia paused there, and when she saw that there was no response from the president, she continued.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But at the same time, you had the power, didn’t you? You had the power to break through the unpleasant reality and push through, yet you followed the rules set by the adults and gave away your loved one. You cared for him so much, you loved him so much, yet you gave him away so easily. How pathetic could you be?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shut up…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But what about the result of giving up so miserably? In the end, Chikage Fujiwara threw away what she took from you in exchange for her trash-like talent. In addition, you carefully erased the fact that the person even existed. Thanks to this, the world has forgotten about the one you cherished. Can you really accept that reality?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I said, shut up!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice was trembling, and her fists tightly clenched as if she was trying to hold something back.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s smile deepened.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You regret it. That’s why you are trying to shut me up, but you can’t. Then, let’s talk. You’ve been through so much, and you’re still talking about rules and regulations. Didn’t you learn then that if you want something, you have to do everything in your power to get it? No, you’ve learned. I know you have. That’s why you broke the rules and tampered with Chikage Fujiwara’s grimoire in retaliation, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shut up! Just shut up!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her scream was filled with anger.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president looked back at her as if she couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her face got dyed with a rage that I had never seen before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You can’t just blab on and on like you know everything!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">But Sophia laughed, even though her gaze was filled with murderous intent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How dare you lecture me when you’ve broken the rules yourself? How dare you be so brazen!? Don’t make me laugh when you broke your own standards.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re too loud! I may not be clean, but I have to act like it as the head of an organization! We are human beings with reason.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You have no reason! How can you when you have so much darkness in your heart?! Hahahahahaha! Even if Chikage Fujiwara were to intervene, your passion will only result in destruction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shut up! You don’t know anything about me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president began to argue violently.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This wasn’t good. It wasn’t going in a good direction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I didn’t really understand why the president was so angry. I needed to clear up a few things.</p>

<p class="calibre4">First of all… It is hard to believe, but it seemed that the president had lost a man to Fujiwara in the past.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This made me even more confused?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Is this what Fujiwara was talking about the other day when she mentioned her ex-fiancé?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, Fujiwara threw away the man she got engaged with, and the president was pissed off, so she retaliated against Fujiwara.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It ends up in the retaliation that was the summoning test tampering.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, that seemed a bit different from what the president confessed to yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In any case, Sophia was using this fact to provoke her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a fistfight of emotions, throwing away logical conversation. Hmmm. Was it a daytime drama?</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was thinking about it, I noticed that Sophia and the president had stopped cursing each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Oh, man. I missed it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What? Is it over already?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No?” Sophia seemed somewhat satisfied. “But since we couldn’t get anywhere with our words, we decided to settle things with a fight. Of course, if this lady wins, you’ll become the president, My Lord.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The words were unexpected, and I reflexively looked at the president.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then she turned away in embarrassment as if to escape my gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre4">No way. I could feel the blood draining down from my head…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“P-President? Um, earlier, you said you couldn’t accept the story…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped. I’m still an immature student, and there are things I can’t tolerate…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">You can’t just say that to me with a sulking tone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wanted to ask them to reconsider, but I didn’t think anything I could say would make them change their minds. No, but, uh, seriously?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why are you looking as if the sky is crashing down? Don’t you have to laugh? Come on, smile.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What can I say to Sophia?</p>

<p class="calibre4">All I could do was give her a half-smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Uwaaaa…!</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The battle against the president will take place after a week of preparation. It was the minimum time required to take over the student council.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Of course, the president has no intention of losing. She simply wants to make sure that the student council’s operation wouldn’t be disrupted in case of an emergency.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Thinking about it, I felt apologetic for Sophia’s recklessness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“My plans have gone a bit astray, but in a week, My Lord will rule this school along with this lady.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Sophia mentioned cheerfully.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">You’ve got to be kidding me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If a person like her happens to take control of the school, it would no longer be an educational institution in any way. It’ll be an armed group of outlaws. I can see that.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This kind of mindset must not be in power, and I don’t think she’s intelligent enough to be in a position of power.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Whatever the case, Sophia’s victory will come if we just sit and wait. I didn’t think that it would change.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Of course, I wasn’t underestimating the president. I knew that she was a prodigy who could reach the top of the professional ranks while still being a student. However, Sophia was so strong that such a thing was meaningless.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I could assure you that no magician in this world could fight Sophia one on one and win.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In other words, if I wanted to stop her, my familiar, I, as her summoner, had to do something about it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No matter what happens, I couldn’t let Marika Sanjo fall from her position as president.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The student council elections were a great opportunity for the West and East factions to fight a proxy war since they couldn’t fight in the open. Naturally, whichever faction takes the student council president seat will have a stronger voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In addition, in the current Japanese branch of the Magician’s Association, the Sanjo family’s dominance was largely thanks to Marika Sanjo.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The title of student council president had a strong influence not only within the school but also in the magician community as a whole.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And, you know, if I were to become the student body president, I wonder how bad things would get.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Just thinking about it sent shivers down my spine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The Sanjo family, in particular, would probably resent me to the point of killing me. The Fujiwara family was already paying attention, but if the Sanjo family joined it, both the East and West would become my enemies.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It would be h**l. That’s why I couldn’t let Sophia win.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Absolutely not!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">By the end of the next day’s lunch break, word of the duel between us had spread to every corner of the school. It seems that the student council members who heard the story from the president let it slip.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was definitely intentional.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Students and staff love to gossip, you know. It was inevitably going to happen.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Anyway, with all the bad publicity I’ve gotten in the past few days, I’ve found myself treated like a terrible villain or a pest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Gossip is usually maliciously transformed or distorted when the subject in question is a hated person.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In addition, the president was so popular that she has hidden fans in the East. Anyone who tries to go against her was made the antagonist.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If anything, the East and the West might even get along a little better now that they have a common enemy like me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Thanks to this, I didn’t have any place to stay at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even Misa wouldn’t come in open to talk to me. I’ll remember this, you heartless b*****d.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">So, after school, I quickly ran out of the classroom before my classmates could throw stones at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No, I’m not a sinner, and I didn’t think I’d be stoned, but it seemed like they would do something like that if I made a mistake. So, just in case, I ran away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">On the empty rooftop, I thought about how I could save myself and get Fujiwara back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In the duel in a few days, I need to find a way to make the president win in a not-so-obvious way and, if possible, clear my reputation. At the same time, I need to pull out Fujiwara’s consciousness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Such a brilliant way… way?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">There isn’t one. Sigh!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I lay there staring up at the azure sky, with nothing but time passing by, I felt a shadow cast over me.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hey, what are you doing here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For a moment, I thought that Sophia, who had been on a school tour for a remodelling plan of the campus, had come back. But that was not the case at all. Instead, my classmate, Asahi Hirano, stood next to me, looking down at me.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’s up, Asahi? I’m the one treated like a demon king in this school, yet you are talking to me without hesitation. If anyone sees you here, you’ll be hated, so go home.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I waved my hand with a shooing motion, Asahi chuckled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t mind since I’m here to talk with a friend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She’s a good person. But that’s why I didn’t want her to get in trouble for talking to me.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You don’t understand my position right now, do you? I really don’t want to be friends with you. Or is that you are actually trying to catch me off guard so you can push me off the roof? You’re scary.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Do you think I’d do something like that to you, Souta-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi sat down next to me, giggling.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She carefully held her skirt and folded her legs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Gently tucking her drooping bangs behind her ears, she softly narrowed her large eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It’s an innocent enough action, but it made me feel strangely nervous.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b2Drtwn/000002.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Recently, Asahi has been acting strange.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">First of all, she has started to talk more openly, which seems to have given her a more grown-up atmosphere. In addition, she has become more sophisticated and s**y… Yes, she feels more seductive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’ve changed, haven’t you? The atmosphere around you is different.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, really? I’ve been working hard with Lilith, my succubus, and Ohno-san, and I think it’s paying off. Clothes, makeup, and so on. Also, the other day I was made to recite a poem loudly I wrote in front of a busy station to build up my courage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi murmured with a faraway look in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What? A bit of shock therapy? You’re being played by a bunch of succubi, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Even if that’s the case, if Souta-kun says I’ve changed, then I’m happy to see the results.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Laughing as she said this, Asahi was as tough as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If you looked closely, you could see that the makeup was carefully applied to enhance her beauty, and she really did look different!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was as if I was witnessing a gem being polished carefully. Seeing her like this, I felt mildly elated.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You look so good. You seem to be popular with the boys these days, and no wonder you want to take advantage of that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah&mdash; Ahaha… I’m not too happy about that, to be honest.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Why not? If it were me pampered by the opposite s*x, I’d be dancing like a maniac by now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It depends on the person. For me, as long as the person I like cares about me, I don’t care about anything else.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You’re so single-minded.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi did not answer. She just played with her hair a little bit with her fingertips and gave me a sly look.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oops, I have to watch out. If it wasn’t for the fact that we were acquaintances from the beginning, that blow might have destroyed my reasoning. That’s how attractive her smile was.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m sure that if she showed this to anyone, she would be able to win over any boy she wanted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was slightly terrified, though, as it seemed that an artificial succubus was steadily being created.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Is a new monster about to be born by the hands of monsters?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Since you’ve been working so hard, I’m sure you’ll be able to win over the man you love.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I really hope that’s the case… By the way, Souta-kun, are you really going to fight the president?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It seems.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi tilted her head as she asked tersely.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Feeling like it’s someone else’s problem?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t really feel it just because things happened without my involvement. I don’t know what goes on between that demoness and the president, but I honestly wish they’d stop. I mean, if I don’t, I’ll be in trouble.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What does that mean?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I explained yesterday’s events in brief.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi, who had finished listening to my story, said in surprise, “So that’s what happened… It’s not like the rumours.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I wondered what kind of rumours have been spreading.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">They probably weren’t good. I didn’t want to know anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry you had to go through that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Seriously. It was a bolt from the blue. No, it wasn’t exactly smooth sailing, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Since the summoning test, I’ve been walking under a cloudy sky. If anything, it’s a blessing in disguise, but this time, the punch was so strong that it hurt badly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I understand the situation, but what are you going to do about it, Souta-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I want to make my familiar lose in a way that won’t cause any problems, do you have any good ideas?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Erm… Umm? Well, how about sending the familiar back to their world?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“If I could do that, I wouldn’t have any trouble in the first place. That demoness… Fujiwara is mixed in with her. We can’t just send her back to the other world. The Fujiwara family will kill me if I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh… I see. That’s definitely not a good idea. Hmm, what should we do then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi fell silent with a serious look on her face, “Hmm, hmm”. She must be thinking about the idea desperately.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Considering the current situation, I was so happy that it brought tears to my eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m all alone all this time, you know.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, if it comes down to it, I can just use the Mark of Obedience and order her to do it, but I don’t want her to resent me for it. I have a feeling that she’s going to try to break the Mark of Obedience by herself at any moment. It’s also possible that the Mark itself is incomplete.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah, hahaha… In the first place, that demoness is not a demon that Sota-kun can control, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yeah. That’s why I don’t want to provoke her too much. I don’t know what would trigger her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… It’s difficult. Why don’t we cooperate with the president behind the scenes?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Huh? Hmm, if you ask me… that? Well, I guess our interests were aligned.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“If we work together with the president and trap your familiar, I’m sure we can beat her. I’m sorry, but I don’t know how to bring back Souta-kun’s reputation.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Let’s put that aside for the moment. The most important thing is for the president to win. As long as that is taken care of, I don’t care if my reputation falls to the ground. It’s not like being hated is going to kill me, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“But… Oh, well. It can’t be helped. I’ll just get hated along with you, okay? Then you won’t be alone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi chuckled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her smile was so beautiful that I couldn’t help but be taken aback.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… That’d be great, thanks. Haha… I guess you’re the only best friend I have.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi looked up at the sky and said, “Hmm… “</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Best friends, huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hey. If you reject it, I don’t think I’ll ever get over it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Fufu… I’m not rejecting it, you know. You’re not wrong. You can call me your best friend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Then Asahi stood up and brushed the dust from her skirt with her hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Let’s go to the student council room. I also want Fujiwara-san to come back, so let me help you.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre4">Together with Asahi, I immediately headed for the student council room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The student council members were gathered inside, contrary to yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Each of them seemed to be busy with their work, and the room was quiet but filled with tension.</p>

<p class="calibre4">They were probably preparing to take over in case of emergency. It’s our fault, isn’t it? I’m so sorry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt like crying.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As soon as the board members saw me, they all gave me a look of disgust.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s as if they wanted to avenge their parents. They seemed to hate me so much. Yeah, yeah, I get it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I was unable to move due to the silent pressure from the board members, the president asked me in a friendly manner, “Oh, Souta-kun? Is something wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’d like to talk with you… Do you have a minute?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I approached the president with reluctance amidst the hostility, like a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Asahi also followed suit with a slightly nervous look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind if it’s just a little bit… By the way, I hope you’re okay with that one, Hirano-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh? How did you know about me…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president’s tired face suddenly relaxed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“During last year’s election, you called out to me as we passed each other in the hallway, ‘Good luck,’ didn’t you? I didn’t get a chance to thank you. Thank you so much for that time. You were a great encouragement to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Asahi’s face turned bright red, and she waved her hands in the air.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not really…!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president laughed, and the atmosphere in the room relaxed a bit.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Could it be that Asahi-san is a saviour or something?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Okay, go with this flow, riding this atmosphere…!</p>

<p class="calibre4">“President, may I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, yeah. What is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I have a question. Do you think you can win against Sophia?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The air in the student council room froze at the question. It was as if I had stepped on a landmine, creating a sense of tension. I couldn’t catch the flow. Ah, never mind. It was dead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president crossed her arms, lifted one eyebrow, and let out a small sigh.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ordinarily, I’d say no.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I got the impression that she was simply stating the facts.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The board members must have thought so, too. They didn’t speak up, but they had a sober look on their faces.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You can’t?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. I’ve been looking at the data on the quests you solved yesterday at the student affairs office, and I also heard from Ryoka. Once I put all that information together, I found out that the demoness is much stronger than I thought. Her power is unfathomable. Perhaps even if I used all the familiars I had at my disposal, I wouldn’t stand a chance. I didn’t expect it to go this far.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And? What are you going to do once you hear that from me? Are you here to recommend surrender?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No. Well, I want the president to win. That’s why I came here to propose that we work together to defeat that demoness together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president narrowed her eyes and scandalously rubbed her chin.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t understand. Can you explain your intentions to me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I simply don’t want to be the student council president. I mean, I wasn’t really into it in the first place, was I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That… Yeah, but if that’s the case, why don’t you just use the Mark to make the demoness oblige?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s what’s bugging me too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, but see, she can procure her magic power and also has high magic resistance. I think that maybe she might be able to undo the Mark by herself… And if that happens, she might kill me after I ordered her to do so. It’s tricky.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh… I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even without that, that demoness must be defeated here. If she wins this school, she’s going to attack the country next. Because her ultimate goal is world domination!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“World domination?” The president gave a half-smile. “Are you serious?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious. And she’s got the potential to do it, so we have to remind her once and for all that this world is not so easy to defeat. President, let’s defeat her together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mm-hmm.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The President groaned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She kept her eyes down for a while, thinking about something, and then muttered, “I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m the one who caused it in the first place. If that demoness could be the enemy of this world, then it is my role and duty to stop it. Hmm, guess it’s fate…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The members looked at her self-mocking murmur with a strange expression. If they knew that the demoness manifested in this world because of the president, they wouldn’t have reacted that way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I understand. I’ll take you up on your offer, Souta-kun. Let’s defeat that demon together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president stood up and put her hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I want to make a plan in private for now. Why don’t you come to my room?”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The student dormitory where the president lived was called The Western Garden, and it was built using funding from the Western Japan Branch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It is a 30-story reinforced concrete building with a structure reminiscent of a high-class apartment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Since she was the head of the school’s faction, she seemed to be living on the top floor in a luxurious apartment with three additional rooms.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry it’s a little messy, but please come in.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The room was like a three- or four-star hotel suite, with a stylish carpet, several elegant-looking pieces of furniture, and a large framed landscape painting hanging on the wall.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It is not the kind of room a student would live in. The many household items in the room seemed to be of a higher standard than any of the furniture Fujiwara had brought into my room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was the kind of room usually owned by a single elderly medical practitioner.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A bourgeoisie. Is this the inequality of society?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wow. What is this? What is this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi was beyond surprised and let out a dumbfounded squeal.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t help but agree with her. “Yikes!” What are you doing? What are you, an elementary school student?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Make yourself at home. I’ll go make some tea.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As she suggested, I sat down on the sofa, and my buttocks felt something neither too hard nor too soft.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It feels too good to be true. What is this stuff? Are you sure they didn’t kill a fairy or something and stuff it inside?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wow, it’s too soft… I feel like falling asleep right here… I want it, and this too…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As we were having this poor conversation, the president came back with fancy teacups on a tray and placed them in front of us along with some western sweets.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t know if it’s to your taste, but you can have some of these if you like. A relative of mine sent them to me.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’ll take it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The tea and pastries were so good that I smiled the moment I tasted them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t help but feel jealous. Damn the upper class.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Can’t they somehow feed us?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“So, here’s the plan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Once we caught our breath, the president, who sat across the table, spoke up as she straightened her posture.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Actually, I’m not completely unprepared. I’m not going to be beaten by this easily.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The president took out a transparent file from her school bag and offered it to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I took it and found a sheet of paper with a magic circle drawn on it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’s this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“This can’t be a magic circle … right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi, who sat next to me, peered at the paper with a dumbfounded expression.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The magic circle, if I could even call it one, had a structure that was too ridiculous to look real. It was far too bizarre.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Any normal magic circle should have a common framework, but this one appeared to have none at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For example, the summoning circle. At first glance, the magic circle for summoning stone golems I made during the summoning test and the magic circle for summoning demons that Fujiwara made looked completely different. However, although with some minor variation, the basic structure was the same, so even an unmotivated, half-baked magician like me could guess what Fujiwara’s summons looked like by looking at it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And just as I guessed, it turned out to be the summoning circle for a powerful demon.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But this one was different.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I had no idea what it was, but it looked like modern art.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s a summoning circle.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked up at the president.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“This thing…?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh. It doesn’t look normal because it is beyond modern-day technology. It has different origins from the magic we usually deal with. It’s like a combination of English and Japanese.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Did you come up with this by yourself, president?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No way. There is no way that I could have created such an extraordinary thing. This magic circle was created by a genius magician… I can’t tell you the details, but I’m not the one who created it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Heh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I looked at the summoning circle, I felt a strange sensation deep in my chest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What was it? What was it that was bothering me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“…? Well, okay. So, what does this thing summon up?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“God.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked at Asahi for a brief reply.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No way, God? The God?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’s that?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You don’t know what God is?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She asked me a difficult question again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I know what the word means, but even then…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I know, but does that lead to religious talk? I’m sorry, I’m not religious, so I’m not good at things like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t worry. It’s not connected. In simple words, this magic circle only summons something that is god-like from our point of view. We don’t know if the actual being is something with divinity as we perceive it. Or rather, it doesn’t matter. It’s a special summoning circle that summons an unusually strong and unpredictable transcendent being.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are these transcendents different from demons?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Not at all. Demons are creatures of the same rank as us, living in a parallel world, right? The fact that the principles of their magic are the same as ours is proof enough.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Whether they are equal or not, yes. So how is this ‘God’ different?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“God is, I can’t find the right word for it. I’ll have to draw it up.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The president took out a piece of paper from her bag and started drawing with a mechanical pencil.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She quickly drew a cartesian plane with the X- and Y-axis, forming a cross.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Assume that the place where our world is here at the origin (X, Y) = (0, 0).”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The president scribbled a circle around the point where the X- and Y-axis intersected. From there, she moved the tip one unit to the right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“The world where demons live is a world that has the same Y-value as ours, but a different X value. For example, (1,0). This world is on the same level as our world, that is, with the same Y value, but as a different X value since it’s a parallel world. However, worlds that have higher values in the positive Y direction are a level above our world.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She then drew a cross on the cartesian plane where the Y value was one unit higher than the origin. (0, 1)</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Our existing summoning techniques are unable to interfere with these higher worlds. In other words, currently, we can only summon creatures from parallel worlds like (1,0), but can’t with higher worlds like the one at positive Y-value like (0, 1).”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Well, I didn’t even know if the metaphor was appropriate. Could you explain it in a way that an uneducated fool like me could understand, please?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Heh. Anyway, this magic circle is awesome, right? Hmm… Hmm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t take my eyes off the magic circle as if it was luring me in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It’s a strange feeling. Was it déjà vu?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t even remember it, but when I looked at this magic circle, I felt a sense of nostalgia.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It’s a magic circle that I couldn’t understand anything in terms of structure, origin, or usage, but something about it stuck with me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Did I know this?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s right. God is a superorganism that exists in a world with a higher positive Y value. That’s why it’s so awesome.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“…? Oh, I see. That’s amazing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Without looking away from the magic circle, I chatted with her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s frustrating that I don’t have enough vocabulary to express myself well, but to manifest in this low-level world… God has to appear in a detuned state, but they are still strong enough to be a match for the demons. That’s why it’s amazing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“So you’re saying that you’re calling an incredibly powerful higher being ‘God’?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s what I was explaining to you earlier.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry for my lack of understanding, but if you can summon such an amazing thing, you would be able to kill a demon without any effort. Oh, or that there’s a problem.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s right. There’s one problem, the ‘God’ you summon is basically uncontrollable.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ha?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked up at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I thought it was a joke, but the president had a serious look on her face.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“In fact, the magician who created this summoning circle was also attacked by ‘God’ and was taken to a higher world.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Attacked… What? Abducted? No way, then this thing is useless.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The magic circle drawn on the paper instantly looked like a disaster.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Just by holding it, I felt like I was being sucked in. I’m sure it’s just my imagination, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s not true. We can’t control ‘God,’ but we can ask for help. By offering something in return, we can have our wishes fulfilled. It’s as simple as that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, that’s right. So, you’re going to offer some kind of price to get rid of the demon?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“If I am forced to use that magic circle, I will make such a request. However, the price to be asked depends on the mood of ‘God.’ It is not an equivalent exchange. In some cases, asking for the demon to be defeated may require my life.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s no good then. It’s a flawed product…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That said, if worse comes to worst, I’ll have to rely on it, okay? And it’ll be on my own accord.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The bitter smile on her face trembled faintly, but I could see a certain resolve in it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No matter what, I couldn’t let her do something so dangerous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“If you’d rather do that, I’ll use the Mark to make her lose.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s a nice offer, but even that has its risks. Anyway, we can do something if we choose to. Of course, if we work together, we might be able to come up with a safer solution, and then we won’t have to take such dangerous measures.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes. Let’s come up with something safe.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I replied and returned my attention to the magic circle again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I felt a burning sensation in my head, like a fever. The feeling of discomfort was getting stronger.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was as if something was struggling to come to the surface in my mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Um, can I?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi, who had been silently listening to the conversation, opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You said earlier that the ‘God’ would come out in a detuned state… What does that mean?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, that’s because matter cannot be transferred between worlds with different Y values. For example, just as we can’t enter the world of manga or anime, beings in the world with a positive Y value can’t just appear in our world. Therefore, when summoning, only the soul of ‘God’ is brought from the higher world, and the body is constructed using the material from here. But of course, as long as it is not the original body, it cannot display its original power. That’s why I called it detuning.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see… Umm, do you have some understanding of this magic circle, President?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I don’t. It is so different from existing magic that I have no idea. However, I was personally close to the magician who created this magic circle, so I’ve heard a lot from him from time to time. The explanations I’ve given you so far are just my own. I’m sorry, but I don’t understand the mechanism itself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Isn’t it dangerous to use magic that you don’t know how it works?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There are no flaws in the magic circle or the grimoire that activates it. You can trust me on that point. It’s the beings summoned that are the problem.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes, I see. But the person who created the magic circle…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry, but I can’t answer that part. It’s complicated.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s okay. Souta-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As she called my name and I looked up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Not good. I had completely lost track of the conversation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… You’re staring at the magic circle quite intently. Is there something on your mind?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, no, it’s just that… It’s unusual, so I just…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I probably deceived myself about the déjà vu, the strange feeling, the discomfort. There was no way to explain it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I feel like I’ve seen this before! Maybe I knew this!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even if I said it, she would probably think I was dreaming or something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I think so myself. Yeah, I was imagining things.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Still, something was bugging me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Fumu.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The president crossed her arms and stared at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I flinched at her passionate gaze as if she was trying to look inside me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… You want me to lend you that? Along with a grimoire to activate it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t believe my ears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For a magician, undisclosed magic is their greatest weapon. Such a thing must be kept secret.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This magic circle, in particular, is a treasure that has the potential to revolutionize magic itself. The president seemed to be in a state of delirium when she proposed to give it to me so casually.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Such an important thing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t mind if you do. I just want you to make sure that no one else knows about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The president took out a thick grimoire and placed it on the table.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“This grimoire only contains the formula for the magic circle, but it’s still this thick. Take it with you and read through it until you’re satisfied.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are you sure you want me to have this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If I was in my normal state, I would have respectfully declined the offer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">By all accounts, this grimoire is knowledge beyond my capacity and is superfluous power.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t need to know it, and I shouldn’t have had it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even though I knew that, I couldn’t refuse… For some reason, as if guided by a strong attractive force, I reached for the grimoire.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m sure you can handle it better than I can. I just can’t help feeling that way.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m not so sure about that. But if you can lend it to me, by all means.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I flipped through the grimoire, which seemed several hundred pages long, and was overwhelmed by its contents.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">An avalanche of knowledge poured in from my field of vision, overwhelming my brain in the blink of an eye.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A strong sense of déjà vu. A nostalgic feeling. As if I knew I was going to get somewhere…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was enveloped in a floating feeling as if I was dreaming while waking up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“S-Souta-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I turned around and saw Asahi looking at me worriedly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, um… You look kind of strange. Are you okay? I think that’s too much for you. I mean, if it were the usual Souta-kun, you would have pushed it back because it would be a hassle. Does it bother you that much? I mean, of course, it bothers me, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmmm… Haha.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I laughed vaguely to cover it up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Asahi lowered her eyebrows and looked at me, then glared at the president.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What do you think you’re doing? Do you really think he can handle this, entrusting Souta-kun with such an unfathomable object? He’s still a student.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Age doesn’t matter. I truly believe that no magician in the world can handle it better than he can.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are you serious?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m serious, I can’t tell you the reasons behind it, but that’s what I expect, Hirano-san. I’m sure Souta-kun is a more capable boy than you think. It’s just that he’s usually unmotivated.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yes, here it comes again, the unjustifiably high rating. Doesn’t she think too highly of me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Though, it’s thanks to her that I got to see the magic circle this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well,” the president’s expression brightened like the rising sun, smiled softly, and straightened her posture,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Now it’s time to think of a strategy. If we can come up with a good plan, I won’t have to use the magic circle, and Souta-kun won’t have to risk giving a command using the Mark of Obedience.”</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre4">A few days went by in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I returned to the dormitory after the first strategy meeting with the president. Sophia was not in her room. She was probably out surveying around the school again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Good.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I opened the grimoire on my study desk and wrote down a new magic formula on a blank page.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Actually, when I was analyzing the grimoire that the president had given me, I came up with a formula that I could maybe apply to this special technology. If I somehow put it into practice, it would be of great help during the battle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I dipped my quill in special ink and dragged it across the blank page.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Little by little, the formula for the magic grew.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a completely new magic formula, different from existing magic. But how could I create something like this?</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was as if I had always known it. As if someone inside me had created it, rather than the current me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ve heard that once you learn something, you basically keep it in your head forever. Even if you couldn’t remember something anymore, the information was still in your brain.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In other words, it was possible to remember a long-forgotten memory.</p>

<p class="calibre4">… No, of course, I hadn’t been exposed to this sort of magic in the past and was remembering it now. But still, it’s a mystery.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ah.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was thinking, I suddenly remembered the time when I met Fujiwara.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t know why I ended up remembering Fujiwara this way. It’s strange.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was the day I entered this school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you have a minute?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After homeroom, while I was changing my shoes at the entrance to go back to the dormitory, someone called out to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">At first, I didn’t think it was for me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t ignore me. Hey, I’m talking to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When she grabbed me by the shoulder and turned me around, I realized the voice was directed at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was a beautiful dark-haired girl staring straight at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I remembered her from before when she was surrounded by many students in the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was surprised by the unexpected appearance of someone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were talking to me. What is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Was this an introduction?</p>

<p class="calibre4">She gave me a curious look as if she was trying to find out what I was thinking.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wouldn’t say it was unpleasant, but it was not an attitude that I found pleasant either.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s Souta Ashiya.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">But at that time, I didn’t have the bravery to argue against one of the most powerful people in the Magic Society, so I answered honestly. It’s uncommon for a mere citizen to go up against the daughter of the Fujiwara family.</p>

<p class="calibre4">No. Well. I would reach the end of my patience and blow it off later.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s mouth was half open…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya… Sou… Ta…? I knew it. I knew it. I knew it…!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What’s that?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I don’t know. But if you don’t need me for anything in particular, can I go home now?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait! I’m… Hey, you don’t recognize me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was so eager that she leaned in closer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She came at me with a glowing, uplifted, expectant look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I nodded my head as I leaned back.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, of course. You’re Chikage Fujiwara.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara choked on her words, “Ah, ugh, wow, me… I was, all the time!” And then her expression crumpled as she tried to say something to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked as if she was too overcome with emotion to express it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had a feeling that I was being misunderstood, which was not good.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly said, “Oh, no,” stifling Fujiwara.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There isn’t a magician in Japan who doesn’t know about you, Fujiwara-san. You’ve been featured many times in magazines, your picture published countless times, and your videos are all over the internet… You’re a celebrity, don’t you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s expression froze for a moment. I felt her disappointment as if I had done something wrong, but I couldn’t help it because I had no idea what else to do.</p>

<p class="calibre4">No, I don’t think it’s possible that maybe we’ve met… somewhere before, based on her reaction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But how could I forget if I was acquainted with such a famous person?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So? What do you want?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I prompted her, Fujiwara’s eyes looked like she was about to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">While trembling, she took a few steps forward and tried to reach out to me with one hand… but then stopped in the middle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Nothing. I just thought I’d say hi as a fellow classmate.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">No, you were definitely not that light-hearted.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But since she said so, I wouldn’t pursue it. It was too much trouble, and I wasn’t that interested.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Thank you for your kindness. I’m Souta Ashiya. Nice to meet you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Yeah, nice to meet you. Ashiya-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We exchanged a word or two, and I went on my way while Fujiwara went back to the school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My first encounter with Fujiwara was like this, and to be honest, I didn’t know what to expect.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Whatever the case, I thought that we would end up as strangers who I just knew by face, without any deep connection. We live in different worlds.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I was wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know what tugged at my heartstrings during this exchange, but ever since, Fujiwara took the initiative to start messing with me. The summoning test was a good example.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m sure she’s mistaken me for someone else.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That was all I could think of, yet I felt otherwise.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was stuck.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The misunderstanding should have been cleared up, but she didn’t even show any sign of it, so what’s the point of coming after me?</p>

<p class="calibre4">It may sound strange, but had I really never met Fujiwara before that moment? Maybe, I’ve known Fujiwara for a while…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Was I forgetting something?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Every time I proceeded to analyze the grimoire, I felt as if I could recall a frayed memory.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had a feeling that an isolated memory that I could no longer remember was speaking up somewhere in my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yes, I remembered Fujiwara and I… No, it must be my imagination. This is ridiculous. Even if I had known Fujiwara before, if I couldn’t remember her, it just means that I didn’t need to remember her anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yeah, that’s fine.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre4">While I experienced the true meaning of the word ‘hectic,’ the day of the decisive battle arrived.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This past week seemed to be the most hectic week of my life. Thanks to this, my mind was hazy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, although it was painstaking, we managed to do everything we could do now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We had a lot of meetings with the president. We even prepared the venue in advance, and in case the worst happened, we had already prepared to summon God. I was relieved to face this day with a readiness that would probably allow me to defeat my own familiar no matter what.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The strategy was based on the new magic I developed, and there are some things I haven’t completely worked out, but I’m sure I could handle it with the president by my side.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was aware I was doing something despicable, but I didn’t feel guilty because the demon’s existence was as good as cheating.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In fact, since the two students joined to defeat the demon, this was enough of a handicap for her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">A fair and square fight? I don’t know such things.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s finally time for the showdown…! Good luck, Souta-kun!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Classes had finished, and I was about to leave the classroom when I was approached by Asahi.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was so enthusiastic that she posed, “Fuhn!” Making a small fist pump.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ou, I’ll do my best. Thank you, Asahi.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Asahi has been following me around for a while now, cheering me on and encouraging me. But because of this, her position in the classroom has become quite questionable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s just the way it is.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Of course, I had told her to stay away from me until the duel was over, but she was strangely stubborn and didn’t listen at all.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As for me, with no one on my side but the president, Asahi’s presence was a great help. I couldn’t refuse her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s right. We couldn’t lose in this duel to restore Asahi’s reputation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. No need to worry. This Lady will win even without your support. Now, My Lord, let’s go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia, who didn’t know anything about our plans, urged me on. I waved to Asahi and walked out of the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Today was a day when all students, including first-year students, did not have afternoon classes, so in addition to us, many other students were heading to the training grounds. The thought of being in front of so many people made me nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The training ground where the duel was going to take place was a large building used for mock battles between students and departments. It looked very similar to a stadium.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It had a vast field surrounded by spectator seats positioned as stairs, and it could accommodate a large number of spectators. There was at least enough room for the entire school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Still, that’s a lot of spectators.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Standing on the field, I looked around me and saw so many spectators that I couldn’t even count them. In addition to the students, there were probably staff and professionals who had heard rumours and were free to come.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was quite an attention-getter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s right. The results of this duel will change the entire Magic Society.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Pull back!” “Lose!” “Trash!” “Die!” “F**k you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“President, please win!” “Don’t lose!” “You’re beautiful as always!” “Good luck!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The division between the dark and the light was unbelievable. How much do they hate me? Also, the president is too popular.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia, who had been clicking her fingers, smiled wickedly amidst a mixture of wild laughter and cheering.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuhahaha! I can’t help but look forward to the idea that this noise will soon turn into heartbreaking grief!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You have a lot of nerve. I feel like I’m about to puke.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be so pathetic. I don’t care what those scum think of me. You are a little too sensitive, My Lord. You are not conscious enough to be a king. Hmm. Perhaps you should embrace a woman for a while to gain confidence.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is this really the time to talk about that?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This is a serious matter,” Sophia replied with a serious look. “For example, what would you think if the head of this country was a virgin? Wouldn’t you label him more as a pathetic man?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… No, well, I might find him unreliable.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? In other words, My Lord, the king who rules the world, must also experience this as soon as possible. All right! When this battle is over, this Lady will accompany you tonight.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious. Mm, that’s better.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia nodded her head and seemed to be pleased with herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She’s so self-contained.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Fufu, I’m looking forward to tonight… So, let’s do it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sophia said while concentrating her magic power on her palms and glared at the president standing at a distance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The distance between us was more than fifty meters.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In front of the president carrying the grimoire were four familiar glaring at Sophia.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a crystal golem and a werewolf that specializes in physical combat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was also an elf, a demi-human race skilled in magic. Elves are often mistaken for demons, but they differ from demons in that they can control magic through chanting and handle the power of their own spirits.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And lastly, a huge red dragon. The red dragon, an ancient dragon species, was considered the second-highest level summon after demons. They were superior in every respect, including physicality, magic, and intelligence.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was said that it was difficult even for professionals to use such high-ranking summons at the same time, but the president of the student council was able to do it. It was an amazing feat of unfathomable talent and tireless effort. Whether or not it would be enough to defeat Sophia was beside the point.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m ready for you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At Sophia’s declaration, the president sent her a look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ll lightly tuck my chin and make brief eye contact with her… It’s so hard to see because of the distance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sophia-san, can I have a word with you? In order to let the audience know how strong we are, please fight in a way that will slowly cause fear and despair, instead of ending it in a moment of stupefaction.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Fumu? Instilling fear… Yes, it might be an effective way to subdue the masses. All right. I’ll do as you wish.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good, good. Fufu, I’m glad to see that My Lord has finally made up his mind. This Lady is pleased.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt slightly guilty when Sophia smiled at me when she said that, but she’s also ignoring my will and going off on her own.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Either way. It should be okay.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think you know what I mean. But please don’t use powerful and widespread magic that could engulf the audience or kill the president.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course, I know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Also, please try not to kill the president’s familiars as much as possible.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? I can understand the fools and that little girl, but the b******s?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. The president is attractive as a force to be reckoned with. I want to keep her strong and add her to my team, so I don’t want her to lose her power.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. You have a point. I’ll take that into consideration.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Good. Now we’d avoided the worst-case scenario of the game-ending early. To be honest, this was the biggest problem. The four familiars could be instantly vaporized if they were hit by a full-force blast of flames or a lightning strike as soon as they started. At that point, our strategy would no longer work, and we would have to resort to the last resort.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now, if the president could just guide and bait Sophia, the mission would be as good as a success.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We’re ready too!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The president stood at a distance and raised her voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her grimoire started to glow as it filled with magical power.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of the field instructors stood between us as a referee&mdash;or observer as we called him&mdash;.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As a final note, the condition for victory is to defeat all of the opponent’s familiars. Any direct attacks on the summoner are prohibited, and if we observe any dangerous behaviour, we will stop the fight, and the opposite party will win by default.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was an orthodox rule often seen in mock battles between summoners.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If there are no problems, I will start the mock battle with a wave of my hand. Both of you, take a stance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the instructor raised his hand, the audience’s cursing stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The air in the training hall became tense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s going to be okay. Everything was going to be fine. I’ve already prepared for this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Start…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just as the instructor shouted, Sophia shot out light bullets, probably a preemptive attack meant to test her opponents.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The four familiars scattered, and the light bullets that had lost their target gouged the ground, causing a cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Loga and Ares attack the demoness! Attack from multiple directions to distract her!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Following the president’s order, the werewolf and crystal golem attacked from both sides.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia dexterously dodged the crystal golem’s heavy blows while using one arm to block the werewolf’s many attacks. Her face tinged with a sneer, perhaps a sign of comfort.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Saria, offensive magic! Elle, stay in the air and prepare for large-scale magic!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The elf readied her bow, drew an arrow, and the arrowhead lit up with magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the next moment, a blue light ray was shot out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The shot accelerated by magic power was too fast for me to react in time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What a trick!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Sophia kicked away the werewolf attacking her and grabbed the enhanced arrow with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, she spun her body as if taking a step and threw it back, adding more magic power to it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The arrow, which has gained momentum and radiance, traced the same trajectory from where it was released and reached the shooter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The elf quickly jumped away, but just as it seemed like she would not make it in time, layers of transparent barriers appeared and stopped the arrow’s momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The arrow didn’t stop, but the elf managed to avoid it in the nick of time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the president’s support magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re careless! Move as soon as you release it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Prepare non-reflective offensive magic! Keep your hands on it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes!”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z2MBY5p/000013.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

The elf started chanting spells at the president’s instruction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she chanted, fireballs appeared one after another around the elf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The high heat emitted by the fireballs distorted the surrounding air. It was a tremendous amount of heat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s see if you have enough of these… FIRE.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">An uncountable number of fireballs flew at Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time, the golem attacked Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! Such child’s play! Shame on you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Sophia dodged the golem’s wide swing, she punched the ground, and as if triggering something in it, the earth rose up with a rumbling. A large earth wall had appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fireballs hit the wall without fail, and the flames swirled as if they were crawling on its surface.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Impossible!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Feeble, so feeble! Kuhaha… Is this the best a weakling can do? Let me remind you of your place. Hahahaha… Hahahahahaha.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Laughing, Sophia struck the crystal golem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crystal golem got repeatedly struck with fists at an unseen speed, and soon its body’s surface was shredded and deformed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The golem was kicked in the stomach as a finishing blow and sent flying, slamming into the buried deployed to protect the audience. A moment later, the students’ screams echoed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The golem slid down to the ground and stopped moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“First one down! And while I’m at it, I should recover some more magic power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic in the air swirled and converged on Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic that overflowed from her body due to overdose turned into a blue aura, covering Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was almost blinded by the horror and beauty of it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president and others looked overwhelmed by the scene.</p>
<p class="calibre4">… How long could we drag this battle?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia was much stronger than I anticipated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Will the president really be able to lead her to the desired location?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll give you a better one!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia smashed the earthen wall she had built with her magic-filled fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crushed earth and sand got struck with magic power and sent flying towards the dragon, who was waiting in the air, and the elf, who was chanting a spell while running.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dragon blew flames to melt the barrage, and the elf created a tornado to block it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You b******s are full of openings!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia kicked the ground and jumped into the flames released by the dragon. Even though her whole body was bathed in the hot flames that blocked the earth and sand, she did not care.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She landed on the dragon’s back with her momentum and raised her hands above her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thunder claw!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The red dragon got electrocuted as purple lightning released from both of her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Strands of pale blue sparks scattered, the surrounding lights cracked one after another, and the deafening sound of explosions resounded. But the red dragon withstood the electric shock and let out a roar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In response to that roar, a huge magic circle appeared above the heads of the red dragon and Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a circular magic circle with a diameter of about ten meters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia tilted her head as she let loose a thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the next moment, light shot down from the magic circle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia and the red dragon got swallowed by the raging light that came down like a mudslide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A fatal blow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dazzling glow lit up the training ground, and I couldn’t help but cover my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A direct hit!” The president shouted. “A primordial magic that only the ancient dragon species can handle! Let the light consume you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intense light also pierced the ground, creating a circular hole the size of the magic circle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The air was trembling. The vibration was so strong that I could feel the pain on my skin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What got swallowed was blocked by such a strong light that it was impossible to recognize.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intense light gradually lost its brilliance… Soon, the magic circle floating in the air disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did we… win?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite her words, the president’s gestures were unflappable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only thing left in the field was a deep, dark hole with no bottom in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no sign of the red dragon or even of Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few seconds of silence. Then a burst of cheers erupted from the audience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia, did you get hit? Seriously?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No. Of course, it would have been best if she got defeated in a fair fight, but… the president was still incredible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia, she’s not dead, right? Fujiwara is still inside her…</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was at this very moment that I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Something jumped up from the depths of the hole.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A large red mass.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It spun like a ball, spreading liquid in all directions. A splash of it splattered on my cheek. When I wiped it off with the back of my hand, I saw that it was warm, and it was blood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time, the president jumped away in panic, and a red mass crashed in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The lump turned out to be the red dragon with scars all over its body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The red dragon, limp and weak, let out a thin whimper and lowered its eyelids as if it had run out of energy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not like it came back on its own, no matter how you looked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, who threw the red dragon up from the abyss…? No, I didn’t think I needed to think about that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I knew it…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The place that had been so bustling had quieted down as if splashed with cold water.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was still in the big hole. Everyone in this place understood that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From the bottom of the abyss, where countless gazes focused, a figure jumped up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soaring high into the sky, she landed lightly on the ground… It was Sophia, after all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But she was not unscathed. Her left arm was more than half charred, emitting black smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fuhn. That’s quite an accomplishment for a lizard.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So-Sophia-san? Your arm’s kind of charred…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Is it? I’m sorry, I let my guard down, but it will heal soon. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia placed her right hand over the damaged part of herself, and just as she had said, it immediately healed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not a single scratch remained. It must be a joke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a ridiculous level of healing magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the primordial magic of the red dragon… You can’t be unscathed after taking… a direct hit…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president shivered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had heard that that blow was her trump card. For summoners, being able to use dragons is a kind of status, and they were considered powerful monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fact that such a dragon’s strongest magic was defeated so easily should have been a cause for fear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All the spectators were now gasping and looking at Sophia in horror.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even the teachers’ faces were tense as they clutched their assistive devices tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knew she was strong, and I convinced myself that the president would not be able to win.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, I hadn’t expected her to be so overwhelming.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That woman. When she was on her quest, was she fooling around…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the second one. Is that a turnaround? Not sure about that. Anyway, soon you all will end up like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia snapped her neck and walked over to the two standing familiars.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“L-Loga, Saria, move as planned! Avoid attacking straightforwardly!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two familiars distanced themselves from Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Playing tag? You’re wasting your time…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She closed in on the werewolf as she muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before the other party could do anything, she clasped her hands together and struck its head from above.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The werewolf was knocked to the ground and stopped moving with whites in its eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no sign of it getting up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“One left. You’re the school president, but how can you be so weak?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia threw a glance at the elf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not good. It was over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sophia-san! It’s the last one, so don’t kill her instantly, make sure you instill fear in her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, leave it to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia replied comfortably and fired a series of light bullets at the elf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They didn’t hit the elf but grazed her at the last minute.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s it. Run, run. The only thing you can do now is run away in vain.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia was like a cat playing with its prey as she leisurely chased after the elf who was desperately running away from the light bullet hail. It was no longer a game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The elf that was being tortured struggled to escape using her making, but she couldn’t avoid getting more wounded. It was not a pleasant thing to watch even though it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuhahahahah… Sure… Here…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, the elf, who had been running away for a while, suddenly stopped at a certain point.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked up, glared at Sophia, and held up her fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fuh… Come…! I’ll at least give you a shot! Come and beat me fair and square!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the elf’s provocation, Sophia lifted the corners of her mouth in a vicious smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stopped in front of the elf, snapping her fingers, “Nice determination. I’ll make it easy for you with one blow.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia caught the fist directly in front of her forehead and smashed her knuckles into the elf’s face in return.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dull sound echoed in the training ground as the elf that got beaten turned around from the momentum… and stopped moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Knocked out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Umu!” Sophia nodded vigorously and was satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I did it! Now the Lord is king! This is where it begins! Our high road.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s high-pitched laugh echoed through the silent training ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Golem. Red dragon. Werewolf. Elf.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The familiars on the field had all run out of steam.</p>
<p class="calibre4">According to the rules, it was an indefensible defeat for the president.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it didn’t matter anymore. In the end, the elf had achieved her goal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Sophia-san, stop. Don’t move. It’s dangerous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I called out to Sophia, who took a step forward with an overflowing sense of joy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia stopped her steps curiously,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is the matter? There’s no danger. This Lady defeated all the Lord’s enemies…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I put on my hidden Zeus I and sent magic power to the grimoire in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s feet lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The camouflaged grass blew away, and the magic circle concealed appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Magic circle!? What is this… My Lord…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A groan went up from the audience. It was probably because the magic circle that appeared at Sophia’s feet looked different. It was something outside of the existing magic system.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Aside from the president, Asahi and me, there was no one else who knew the true nature of the magic circle emitting a purple light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, the fact that I was directing this unknown magic at my own familiar must have been one of the reasons why they all were confused.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you plan this? Why are you doing this? No way… You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t intend to pretend it’s a joke either. I’m sorry, but I really don’t want to be the student body president. I’m also not interested in being the world king or anything like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s expression became increasingly grim as I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then, frustrated, she tried to get out of the magic circle… only to be blocked by the barrier deployed on the magic circle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia violently punched the transparent wall, but it was too strong to break from just that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Is that so? That’s right, I understand very well. It seems that my Lord wants to provoke this Lady even more. Foolish. I will not tolerate anyone who opposes me, even if it is you, my Lord. It seems that this Lady, as a loyal vassal, must educate you once and for all! Yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light bullets she released haphazardly bounced off the barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s eyes widened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s no use. It’s the same as the summoning test… No, it’s far stronger than that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The flames that she fired in succession were also blocked by the barrier and disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It is a barrier that applies technology from an upper world. It’s impossible to break.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh…? Wha? An upper world, you say? You got your memory back…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I replied plainly without understanding, Sophia looked back at me curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a strange atmosphere. Oh well. There must have been some inconsistency in the information.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Erm. In case you’re wondering, it’s a special magic circle that applies some of the magic used to summon beings from worlds higher than this one, and it’s fundamentally different from ordinary ones.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Fuhn. It’s a big deal. And? What are you going to do with me with this special magic circle?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve no intentions of harming you, Sophia-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I said this, I sent my magic power into the grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic circle grew brighter and swirled, causing Sophia’s flaming hair to shine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If my theory is correct, with this magic I’ve created…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right in front of me, the ground started to glow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next moment, the grass blew away, and another magic circle appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time, Sophia’s face twisted, and she fell to her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A lump of skin-coloured flesh floated above the new purple-glowing magic circle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The handball-sized lump wriggled violently like a fetus, and when it seemed to expand in the blink of an eye, it eventually took the form of a person and transformed… directly into a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had long black hair and a slender body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“All right!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My plan worked, and I made a small gut punch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic circle lost its shine, and the woman floating in the air fell to the ground from her back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was unconscious, or perhaps she had fallen and was not moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that Chikage Fujiwara? No, there’s no doubt about it. Chikage Fujiwara’s spirit is no longer inside this Lady…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia muttered in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crowd, the teacher, and everyone else present was speechless, staring at Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was naked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah. I think I might have messed up a little bit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not good to leave her like this, so I took off my school coat and hurriedly put it on Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“President, please take care of the rest. I’ve just been drained of all my magic power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. You’ve done well. You can leave the rest to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Student Council president, who had somehow come to my side, nodded vigorously and placed her palm on her grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My magic circle holding Sophia lost its glow, and another one appeared underneath it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This one glowed blue and was a transfer circle that opened a tunnel to another world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You better have an explanation! What’s going on? I do not understand. I do not understand anything!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s voice trailed off as she punched the barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unlike my barrier, the transparent wall shook from the impact. The president groaned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked at Sophia as I fastened the front button of the school coat I had put on Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I extracted only Fujiwara’s soul from you, Sophia-san, and reconstructed her body based on that soul. That’s a quick separation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When summoning a creature from a higher world, it is necessary to drag only the soul and spirit into our world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By applying this technique, I was able to extract Fujiwara’s soul from inside Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, I’m going to use the transfer magic to send Sophia-san back to her original world. Thank you for your hard work. Please take care of yourself in the other world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be silly!” Sophia screamed out. “Why would you do such a thing? I still understand that you had to separate me from Chikage Fujiwara! But I don’t understand why you want to send me back to my world!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t want to admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia punched the warding, desperately pleading with a sad expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though we don’t share the same values, I found out that Sophia was seriously thinking about me in her own way, and I felt an unexpected pain in my heart. I should at least tell her why.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please understand. I do not deserve you. You’re far superior to me. So, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The emotion drained from Sophia’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stared back at me with a frighteningly blank expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just as I was thinking, her facial muscles twitched…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How dare you make a fool of this Lady… I am Sophia Edel Eilam. The cost of this betrayal will be high. Don’t think you can ever atone for this…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia laughed as she got enveloped by the dazzling light coming out of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Both ends of her mouth hung to the limit as she smiled with unconcealed madness in her bright red eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For the first time in my life… I’ve been made fun of… I got ridiculed! This kind of feeling! I’ll never forgive you for that…! Never! I’m not going to let you get away with it, no matter how much you apologize.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m really sorry, Sophia-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This Lady! I… For the sake of my Lord! I worked so hard! The moment you don’t need me, you’re throwing me away like trash… Do you feel nothing about me!? I’m not going to let you get away with this! Aan!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, it hurts… It hurts, but I had to do this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After my response, Sophia burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was like a broken audio player.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She laughed while holding her stomach and shedding tears, but then she glared at me with murderous intent in her eyes…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah, yeah! That’s the only way! Kuhahahaha, hahaha. I’ll make you regret it for sure! Hiii-Hahahaha! Don’t you fools think you can survive with this Lady as your enemy! I’ll kill you myself..! Ahahahaha! You’ll regret it… for sure!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s too scary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was pissed off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“President, please send that woman back as soon as possible. I’m afraid she’s going to kill me with her gaze at any moment. I’m not kidding. I’m seriously about to s**t my pants.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m doing my best without being told. I’m trying, but her magic resistance is too high. It’s the first time I’ve ever encountered resistance like this… which could break the magic spell. I’m not sure what’s wrong with that woman… but if I’m not careful, even the slightest bit, she can kill us all in an instant…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president was sweating profusely, with it dripping from the tip of her chin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, wait. Wasn’t this actually quite dangerous…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You sure you’ll be fine, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The urgency of her voice filled me with anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I rubbed my tightened facial muscles and forced a smile at Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia, who was gnashing her teeth ferociously, screamed as if she was angered by my gaze. It was scary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please calm down. You know what? It’s not that I’m trying to send you back because I don’t like you. I just don’t think the ethics of this world fit Sophia’s values.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hiii&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was the first time. It’s the first time I’ve ever accepted another man! I thought that you… with your power to access the higher realms, we could be together! That’s what I thought! It was… my first time! The man that this Lady wanted to be with was you… I really…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuha-ha-ha-ha! It’s the first time I’ve been betrayed like this… Such embarrassment, shame, shame, shame… Uuuuuuuu… I’ll never forgive you for that…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia started crying raggedly. It’s as if her emotions had reached a critical point. But I don’t think she was pathetic or pitiful in the slightest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At any rate, the bloodlust has not subsided.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was constantly punching the barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the form of a demon, and with eyes that looked like she was about to bite off your throat, she was like a wounded beast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, please don’t do this! I’m really sorry, but Sophia-san’s wrong too! You don’t listen to what I have to say. You just go off on whatever you want, and there’s nothing I can do about it; your ego is too big! It was hard for me! Seriously!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you’re a man, you should at least accept a woman’s selfishness…! Haaa, haaaa, haaaaaa, I’ll never… never… f, forgive, you! Absolutely, absolutely! I won’t forgive you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s face was full of tears, but she had a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve never seen a creature that embodied so much ‘too much cuteness is a hundred times more hateful.’</p>
<p class="calibre4">You must return to your world as soon as possible…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ggh!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president grunted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, Souta-kun, I’m sorry…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What?</p>
<p class="calibre4">A feeling of fear ran through my body as if frozen water poured into my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned around and saw the president on her knees. She looked at me with a face as if she was about to die, and her eyes were unfocused. But she was biting her lip to avoid fainting, and there were several streaks of blood flowing from her lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how you looked at it, she was close to the limit. No. She was already over the limit. And yet, she was still holding on. So I guess that meant she could collapse at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s over…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! You were so close! So close! After all, you’re merely a human! There was no way you could be a match for this Lady! It’s good to be alone! Who needs a lord! There is no one who can stand up to me! Hahaha… I will erase you all along with these shameful memories! Hahahahahahaha! Hahahahahaha!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">From behind me, the voice of a demoness filled with frenzy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My body trembled with fear, and I couldn’t look at Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Run away…! This can’t be happening…! I’m sorry…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president said breathlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, we’ll die even if we escape. I mean, how can I leave the president and run away?</p>
<p class="calibre4">But what was I supposed to do? Neither the president nor I had any magic power left to summon God anymore. Because we thought the plan would work, we had completely focused on it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the meantime, I was going to have to reactivate my barrier… If I couldn’t use the transfer magic, I’d eventually lose my life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’d just be wasting magic power even if I could temporarily contain her. It wouldn’t mean anything in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, yes, maybe the order! Oh, but will that thing really work on her?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No! It didn’t matter if it worked or not! It’s the only thing I have left to do!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then what should I order her to do? Like, die? No, I couldn’t do that!</p>
<p class="calibre4">But… Oh, s**t!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t think straight!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned around, startled by the voice I heard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was awake wearing my school coat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve regained consciousness?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked a bit sluggish, but there was no other noticeable abnormality.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, there was still a Mark of Obedience engraved on her forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to you. What’s the situation…?” Fujiwara asked, looking around. “I see. Losing at the very end?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it because of her comprehension or because she had shared memories with Sophia until just before the separation? Fujiwara understood the situation without any explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, you had to go through all this trouble to get us separated.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the urgency of the situation, there was no time for the usual hateful remarks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara shook her head loosely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No. Thank you for helping me. I’m fine. I’ll take care of the rest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure you don’t have much magic left, Ashiya-kun. So even if you share it with me, you’ll lose most of it over the supply circuit transfer.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara let out a sigh and walked over to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she stood right in front of me, she took a deep breath, looked up at me and smiled. And then she stretched her arms around my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Close your eyes?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? No, you…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know what was happening, but I felt a tremendous sense of intimidation, and I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mmph!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My lips were stolen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a gentle touch of her mouth, her tongue went into my mouth.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8jNF4Nw/000011.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“Mhm, nhm, mmmm, Mhmm!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly opened my eyes and saw Fujiwara’s face through the lenses of my glasses. She was very close to me with her eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Wow, this girl has long eyelashes. But that’s not what I should be thinking…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The invading tongue swirled in my mouth, entangling itself with my gums, the back of my lips, and my tongue, sucking the magic power out through the mucous. I struggled, but she held my head so tightly that I couldn’t escape at all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if I got trapped by a giant snake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought I was going to be eaten.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ha? W-what are you doing? Hey, are you listening to me? Hey…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia was shouting, but it fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We don’t have time for this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, fmm, hmmm, nhm, nn?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to breathe, I forcefully inhaled air through my nose and smelled a familiar scent. As soon as I realized that it was Fujiwara’s scent, which I had come into contact with many times during our life together, I felt strangely calm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And although I was upset, I also realized that the act itself was not so unpleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It must be what they call a comfort blanket in psychology. Yeah.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the field of vision, Fujiwara slowly opened her eyelids and… smiled thinly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;Pah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since she had already taken enough magic power from me, she let go of my mouth and lightly pushed me in the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Having been robbed of a large amount of magic power, I couldn’t hold on and stomped my foot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Unbelievable. I can’t believe this was my first kiss.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara spat, wiping her mouth with the sleeve of her school coat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But was it an illusion? Her mouth, hidden by the sleeve, seemed to say something else…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, thanks to you, I’ve got the magic. So yeah, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara walked up to Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president’s barrier surrounding Sophia was still barely functioning. The blue light running through the magic circle was faint, and the barrier started wavering. There was no guarantee that it would retain its shape in a few seconds. Above all, the president had already collapsed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She probably didn’t even have any consciousness left, let alone magical power. However, she still had her hand on the grimoire. She seemed to be pouring her magic power into it until the very end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fufu. Are you jealous? For a sore loser?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At Fujiwara’s provocation, the demoness’ expression broke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">An inaudible scream rang out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before the warding shattered, Fujiwara thrust one arm out in front of her. Her fingertips glowed slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instantly, a magic circle unfolded at Sophia’s feet. A blue light continued to run through the magic circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a transfer circle, but it wasn’t the president’s. It was hard to imagine, but Fujiwara had created it right there and then. That’s all I could think of.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was like Sophia, who could perform magic without the need for chanting or assistive devices.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Another barrier!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the transfer formation. On behalf of the president, I’ll send you back to the other world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic circle’s glow increased, but Sophia resisted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! You’re the one who couldn’t save that scum on your own, so you begged for help from me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a shameful past. That’s why I’m sending you back to clear up that stain.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll let you say it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara smiled as Sophia glared at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Still, this situation reminds me of the summoning test. Well, it’s the complete opposite of what I did back then. I don’t need you anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s face was bloodshot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My, you have no sense of humour, and you dare to taunt this Lady…! You’ll regret this when it’s too late. I’ll kill you…! I’ll kill you, too. And I’ll destroy this world too! Mark my words!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you can do it, do it. I’m sure you can’t, though, because you’ll be sent back now. And for the record, you can’t even stop me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re getting carried away! You big, fat, female monkey!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha, haa? You can’t stop me! Oh, you can’t speak for others either, can you? It’s so embarrassing to get dumped and then go on a rampage! Huh! It’s too bad you didn’t get any younger guys to take you seriously.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll kill youuuu! Uooooooooooooo!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia went berserk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One after another, she unleashed her magic and hit the barrier in a frenzy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Every time she did this, Fujiwara let out a small voice as if she didn’t have as much strength left. But the sharp gaze that glared at Sophia did not waver in the slightest, even if her opponent was Sophia, the most powerful demon and a monster that beat the president.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara seemed to be in great shape now, but it still felt uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Damn it. All I could do now was watch?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, I’m aware of my own weakness. I wanted to help, but I could only drag my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even the teachers watched from the sidelines, but what can you say?</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, whatever it is, I can help… Ah, yes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stood next to Fujiwara, worried just a little bit. I took Fujiwara’s other hand, which wasn’t pointed at Sophia. Her hand trembled at the touch, but she didn’t shake it off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll send you as much magical power as I can. It’s the least I can do, but good luck with that…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I squeezed the magic power out of the depths of my body and let it flow in just barely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Fujiwara was in charge of sending her back, there was still one last thing I had to do. So I couldn’t give her everything. But I will give everything else to Fujiwara. That’s all I can do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Please, please.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia’s anger reached its peak at the sight of the two of us, and she screamed like a beast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The attacks became even more fierce. Fujiwara staggered with each attack on her barrier, so I supported her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-yeah. No problem. After all, she’s worn out too. Little by little, her resistance is waning. She’s almost at her limit… She knows that too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia, who was rampaging inside the barrier, certainly looked like she was in agony if you asked me. That’s right. Against the transfer magic, where the summoner has an overwhelming advantage, she managed to resist to such an extent even though she was the target. No matter how strong, the familiar will always have a limit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If there’s something you want to tell that woman, now’s the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s words made me think for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’d like to tell her… Something, I guess…</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s just, well…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sophia-san. Thank you for all your help. And I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I apologized one last time and sent what little magical power I had into the grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Inhale.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I, Souta Ashiya command! O Sophia Edel Eilam! Forget everything you know about this world and return to your own as if nothing ever happened! Forget about us! Let it sink into the recesses of your memory, never to be called again! Never, ever remember us!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The mark on Sophia’s forehead flashed phosphorescence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a compulsory order with the mark of obedience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sophia shivered and screamed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Youuuuu b*****d!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She punched the ward, stuck to it, and pressed her forehead against it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From the other side of the barrier, Sophia glared at me with eyes bloodshot to the extreme.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Bullshit! Such depraved behaviour… Damn you, damn you, damn you! You want me to forget…! It can’t be happening! Damn it! I’ll… never forget, never forget! Never, never! I cannot forget, I will not forget, never forget this feeling, this frustration, this humiliation…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Goodbye.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time as Fujiwara’s declaration, a torrent of light rolled up from under Sophia’s feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Agitated, Sophia’s outline distorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be back! This Lady will come for you! I’m not going to let you get away with it! Even if it’s in a parallel world beyond measure, I will make sure to find you and kill you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her voice echoed, and she disappeared beyond the light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The transfer circle lost its power completely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no sign of Sophia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it over…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Were we saved, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t die …?</p>
<p class="calibre4">For real?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slumped down on the spot with a sly smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Finally…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was so tired that my voice lacked strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I held my violently beating chest with trembling hands when someone called my name, “Ashiya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked up and saw Fujiwara in my school uniform looking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We did it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, oh. Look at this. My fingers are still shaking. In the end, it was really scary. I thought I was going to s**t my pants. I think she was really pissed, that woman…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I showed her my twitching fingers, Fujiwara sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was still too lousy. Can’t you at least finish it off with something cool?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be absurd. Aah, no, I really thought you were dead. If Fujiwara hadn’t woken up at the right time, I really would have died. Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate that…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps it was because the tension holding me back was no more, but I was surprisingly honest in my thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara blinked at me unexpectedly, smiled, and extended her hand to me as I slumped down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Here, can you stand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, thanks.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took her hand, and she pulled me up forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But because I had used up all of my magic power, I couldn’t muster up the strength and staggered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t keep my footing and leaned against Fujiwara with the same force I got pulled up with.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Utto, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s okay. don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the fact that we were hugging each other from the front, I was not blamed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I was surprised by Fujiwara’s thoughtful response, she called me by name, “Ashiya-kun,” while we were still in close contact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, ah, I’ll get back soon…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for your help. I was happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She whispered in my ear with her gentle voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned my head to the side and saw Fujiwara with a soft smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dazzling smile devoid of guile or sarcasm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was so unusual that I was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara must have been embarrassed by such a reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she pulled away from me, she stuck out her tongue with a “buu” before turning away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, what’s with the embarrassment? It doesn’t suit you at all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Your ears were all red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know how embarrassed we both were.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I returned, scratching my head to calm myself down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked around the quiet training ground and finally took a breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now, what should I do?</p>
