<h2 class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre11">Chapter 2 &#8211; Mastering the Ambition</strong></h2>

<p class="calibre4">“Will I be stuck like this for the rest of my life?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Over a month had passed since Fujiwara became my familiar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was evening, and we were on our way back home from completing a quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After defeating a magical beast that had appeared in a ruin on the outskirts of a town, Fujiwara and I stopped at a cheap family restaurant to have an early dinner because we were hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I… wonder when I stopped questioning this status quo. Now that I’m aware of it, it shocks me. Why am I being ordered around by you to complete a quest and eat dinner? Is something wrong with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, who had been quietly scratching the chicken, abruptly said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… No, but now that you mention it, I have no idea.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I replied, holding back the hand that was curling the pasta.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara stared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun, if things continue like this, I’ll be in a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m already in trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? You’re not in trouble at all. You can use me as you like. What’s the problem you have?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m getting a lot of f*cking threats from your parents, and the guys from the East ridicule me at school on a regular basis. I want to live an easy life, so I hope things will go back to normal soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I could go back… How do I get it back in time?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I do not know. And I can’t imagine getting a girlfriend if things don’t go back to normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Regardless, I don’t think Ashiya-kun will ever get a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can you say such a terrible thing with a straight face? You demon!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara swallowed a piece of chicken she had cut into pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean… if this continues, we’re going to end up in that kind of relationship…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you insane?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her concern was groundless, so I complained.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She shook her head loosely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“People around me are already looking at me like that. As a matter of fact, if we don’t do something about the current situation, we won’t be able to physically get away from each other. And since we’re a man and woman of the same age, inevitably, we will eventually…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“YAMERO! Please don’t say horrible things! That is impossible!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I agree, but why do you reject me so much? I’ve got it all, looks, intelligence, background… What is it about me that makes you so unhappy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Character.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara thrust a knife at me with a straight face. It was exactly what I meant by character.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Calm down. A knife used for eating is not for stabbing a classmate. And I’m not trying to say that you’re a goddamn brat, I’m just saying that our personalities don’t mesh. If we stay together forever, I’m afraid I’ll become neurotic in the near future.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no way a thick-skinned jerk like you could become neurotic.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There you go. The problem is that you undermine me as easily as breathing. That’s why it’s absolutely impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara fell silent when I pointed it out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She glared at me disapprovingly and ate her chicken with an upturned gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But if we don’t do something about this, we’ll end up arguing for the rest of our lives.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know what? I feel like I should take you for that. You’re going to become neurotic if you wind up with me, right? Fine, I’ll make your body incapable of living without neurotic medication.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was not a hint of a joke in Fujiwara’s eyes as she said this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, don’t get desperate. No one will benefit from a relationship between you and me, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true. However, you will be adopted as a groom and will become a member of the Fujiwara family. Once you join Japan’s greatest magician family, who controls the Eastern Japan branch, you’ll work day in and out to the point of vomiting blood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, as the future leader of the East, I’ll take the brunt of the battle against the West, and I’ll also restrain my competitors in the East. Lastly, if you want, as my future husband, you would be the next head of the Fujiwara family. You’ll constantly fight for power in the family.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The daily pressure can be quite overwhelming, to the point of making factional fights in the campus look like a joke, but I won’t let you go. I absolutely won’t. Not until Ashiya-kun’s…, or Sota Fujiwara’s stomach, is gouged. I’ll keep a diary of every detail to make sure of it. It’s the only thing that I look forward to in my life… Fufu… Let’s fall into the abyss together, my dear husband… Ufufu… Ahahaha…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara loosened her mouth, but her eyes were not smiling at all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was frightening to hear her talk so plainly. I could feel a strong evil aura pour out through every word she said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was immediately sickened by her unwavering, evil enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I really don’t want this to happen. I will die. I’m definitely gonna die.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t want to, you should be strong enough to free me. If you can’t, I’ll just adopt you as my husband. Don’t worry. Even if you bite the rock while crying, I will definitely take you to my parents’ house, and I mean it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I will take care of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Regardless of whether or not I would join the Fujiwara family, I knew that I had to do something about this situation. It was pretty hard to be with Fujiwara all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What I want most right now is some time alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, we were looking into ways to get back to normal, but… no matter how good Fujiwara was, she’s still just a student. I’m not sure how we will find a solution that even the professionals have given up on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">… My future is at risk.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre4">The following day I had a nightmare where I was taken in by the Fujiwara family. My miserable life was ended by gouging out my guts with regrets after working to the bone for them in it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As for us second-year students, about half of our weekly classes were over in the morning, allowing us to spend more time on self-study and quests.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After school, Fujiwara usually dragged me to do practicals or go on quests with her friends, but today I had something else in mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara. I’ve got some business to attend to at the Engineering Department if that’s fine with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Magical Engineering Department is a section that trains students to become Magic Engineers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In simple terms, Magic Engineers are scholars of magic, and their activities are diverse. Their main activity is to manufacture magical equipment, but some also actively engage in research about other worlds and the demon ecology. Without Magic Engineers, there would be no development of magic. Thus, they are the largest group among Sorcerers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, the Magic Engineering Department has the most students and faculties in the school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you looking for some magic items?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kind of.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, Fujiwara and I headed to the engineering building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The school campus had a total of four buildings, one of which was the stronghold of the magic engineering students. We headed to a certain laboratory on the second floor of the engineering building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though it was after school, the engineering building was full of activity. It was like a Friday night entertainment district, but with engineering students constantly touting students from other departments.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, onii-san, why don’t you buy some useful magic equipment?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s new! You can maintain your magic circuits with just one of these devices!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A magic bomb for in times of need! It can shatter steel plates in one shot! What about you, summoners, out there? It won’t let you down!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sale, sale, really cheap! It’s really cheap! Hey!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were as desperate as if they’d entrusted their wives to a pawn shop. While refusing the touts, I somehow managed to arrive at the lab I wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I knocked on the door, it opened, and several people in the room looked at me, but they quickly lost interest and went back to their work. There was one woman who looked at me and smirked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look who it is! Sota!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With long, shaggy hair, a worn-out lab coat, old bathroom slippers, and glasses, this girl looked completely abandoned was my childhood friend, Misa Konoe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it that you came to see me? Yawn, I’m so happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa smiled and walked over to us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be silly. I’m here for the item you mentioned. Sell it, you money-grubbing girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you’re so mean~. That’s why you can’t get a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While saying this, Misa took out a pair of black glasses from her lab coat pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ta-da! This is our masterpiece, the all-purpose glasses, Zeus No. 1!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a shame that a pair of glasses can bear the name of a god. What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara plunged in, and Misa forcefully put the glasses on my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, well, Fujiwara-san. You’ll have to ask Sota, who will be using the glasses, about the features you’re interested in.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The glasses didn’t have any power in them. Are they fake?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi. I asked you to add a magic power tank. What’s with the glasses? It looks like a piece of junk.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Blabber while you still can. It has not only the function of a magic power tank, of course, but it also has a super convenient feature as an added bonus! Sota, I’m sure you will love it! Now then, pinch the strings and inject the magic power.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I followed Misa’s instructions and injected the magic power from my fingertips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A faint glow ran through the geometric magic circuitry engraved on the surface of the lens.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My magic power is being sucked out of me at a rapid pace. Was it really a magic power tank? How much capacity does it have?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The tank capacity is about 500 DP, which is enough for two average sorcerers. By the way, in terms of Sota, it would be enough for about five Soutas. Your magic power capacity is that miserable.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up. But I agree that though this thing is small, it’s amazing. So, what’s the most useful feature?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. When the glasses have accumulated a certain amount of magic power, concentrate the magic power in your right eye.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The lens on the right side begins to glow faintly. A little later, the left side started to glow as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And through the lens, Misa’s lab coat disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, the uniform underneath gradually became transparent, and she seemed to be in… underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Whoa! What is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa smirked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you see how transparent my clothes were? Hmm~?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she swayed her hands and looked like she was wearing nothing but her top and bottom underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I wonder how I can still see your p*nty and br*. It’s so f*cking fancy, but win-win underwear…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it is. Well, I went to the trouble of getting new ones for this presentation. Hmm… Now that you can only see through the clothes, if you accumulate a little more magic power, you can see through underwear too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Seriously?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious. You may have guessed it, but it’s a function that allows you to see through matter by focusing your vision. It is activated by consuming the tank’s magic power. The more magic power you consume, the more you can see through. In other words, Zeus No. 1 is a divine invention that will make X-rays, CTS, and MRI a thing of the past through the wisdom of magical engineering! Surprise!” [EN: Collimated Transmission Spectroscopy (CTS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t… amazing? This…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa rushed in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I never thought I’d be able to invent something like this! It’s amazing! I’m afraid of my own talent… Yay Sota! Yay!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I got a high-five with a squealing Misa. By the way, she seemed to be still in her underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have no idea how to turn off the function.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh well, I guess it’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s amazing. What’s the logic behind it? I have no idea!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure either! More importantly, Sota, come on, look at me, The S**y Pose…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah! You look great!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really? Then what about this?… Ufu~n!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hieee! It’s not erotic at all!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Ashiya-kun!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we were both giggling, I heard an unsettling voice from beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gulp. I had forgotten about Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said… you can see through the clothes?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“N-nope… I didn’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I was about to turn around, she snatched my glasses away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I could stop her, Fujiwara put on the glasses and looked disgusted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha! What the h**l is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s Zeus No. 1!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t ask for its name! This… Such a shameful and dangerous thing!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s face turned bright red, and she slammed Zeus No. 1 to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It bounced heavily from the impact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…? What are you doing? Wait, stop…! Stop it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa covered those glasses as if she was protecting a baby.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was about to chase and stomp her, but as expected, she held her ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What have you done to our masterpiece!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa, who had secured the glasses, distanced herself from Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can’t you even tell the difference between what’s okay and what’s not? You’re evil! You have no sense of decency! That’s why you’re called Japan’s Dark Lord and a walking magic landmine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hou? I’ve never heard of this!” Fujiwara exclaimed, her eyes widening in astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, now tell me! Which class? Grade? Just tell me about their department!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Those kinds of students are everywhere in the engineering department, so there’s no end to trying to identify them!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara frowned, perhaps because of the unexpected response.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s okay. Anyway, first things first, why doesn’t it bother you being seen in your underwear by Ashiya-kun? Are you a lascivious woman?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m not! It’s not like I’m going to lose anything by being seen, and it’s too late for that! Sota and I used to bathe together a lot, so I don’t think anything of underwear, to be honest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haaaa!? Oh my god, stop…! Think about how old you are! You’re not a child anymore! Now, hand over that dangerous thing to me! I’ll get rid of it! Hurry up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I won’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa hid behind my back, and thanks to her, I had to face the red-faced furious Fujiwara head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, give me a break. This girl was really messed up. If I provoked her, she might break my nose or something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun? You’re smart enough to know what you should do, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-wait a minute. The main function of these glasses is not to be used only for dirty purposes. The main function of the glasses is just a magic power tank, and even you are worried about my unreliable magic power, right? But destroying it is a bit unfair… you know…? Right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can simply buy a normal magic tank. Just a regular one! Not that nasty stuff.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I can…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;Wait!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I was wondering what to do, Misa shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is not intended to see through clothing, but only to see through objects! It’s very useful when you’re fighting in a place with a lot of shielding or when you need to go stealthy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara flinched as she heard a more serious counterargument than she expected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And the see-through function isn’t the only added feature! This Zeus No. 1 has the most powerful magic armament, Divine Thunder, built-in for emergencies!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa jumped out from behind me as if to say, “I’m glad you asked.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s an offensive electric magic that consumes all of the tank’s remaining magic power and releases it! Its power scales corresponding to the amount of magic power consumed, and it shoots out a single lightning bolt at the focus of your vision. It is the last trump card, an insurance policy in case Fujiwara-san falls and Sota, who isn’t good at fighting, is left alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you’ve put a lot more thought into this than I thought.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Fujiwara muttered surprisingly, Misa nodded and said, “Of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whether a tool is good or bad depends on the person who uses it. Guns have killed countless people in history. But at the same time, lives have been saved by those same guns. It’s the same with Zeus No. 1! I believe that if you use it right, it’ll definitely help the two of you in your quest! Whether you’re a good guy or not is beside the point!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not worrying about the rest, its function was the most important part.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara took a half step back as if overwhelmed by Misa’s passionate speech.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed that she no longer had an argument to fight back one way or the other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, who had been wrinkling her brow in frustration, let out a breath as if to give up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Okay. But if you see me naked with those glasses, I will never forgive you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry. I’m not going to look at your naked body even if my eyes explode and my brain matter shoots out. I swear to God.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara glared at me when I stated it boldly. What was it?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, well, whatever it is, now I can buy it with peace of mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, now that you’ve given me permission, I’ll buy it. How many points?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In general, when you buy magic equipment from engineering students, you would pay points instead of cash. This is because there are few quests for engineering students, and they have few ways to earn points. That’s why they’re desperately trying to sell magic tools to summoners and magic warriors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like us, engineering students need a certain number of points to graduate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you again. Hehe, that’ll be 60,000 points!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My eyeballs almost popped out of my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s too much!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa shrieked furiously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve discounted the price considerably because of you, Sota. I charge more to others! And I can’t possibly graduate without selling stuff. It is the best I can do! Reasonable price! You got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But you know what, 60,000 is more than a million yen in cash…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You think these glasses aren’t worth it? I made them for you, Souta, after working overnight! These glasses, which contain my love for Souta, have no value at all? I’ve even shown you my underwear! Oh, maybe you want to see me completely naked? … Hurry up and buy it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Regardless of that last suggestion, the glasses themselves were certainly of tremendous value because they could be used for dirty stuff. How could I not want them? I’d even be willing to give up a kidney for them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I can’t afford not to.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have about 30,000 points on hand… is not enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara and I split the reward points for the quests. We’ve done our fair share of quests, but as individuals, we haven’t accumulated much. And yet 60,000 is a bit much, you see?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mmm. That’s certainly impossible. But 30,000 for this great invention of the century is… hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa, who had been groaning for a while, clapped her hands and said,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay, here’s what I’ll do. For now, I’ll take 30,000 for the down payment, and you can pay the rest in installments.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is this a debt? Oh, no, not debt… Anyway, what’s the interest rate?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No interest, we’re good friends, right? You just have to pay back 5,000 points every month on the 15th.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Seriously? I appreciate that. Then in that case… ”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But you’ll have to make a promise…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… What kind of?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa coughed deliberately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you fail to pay back even once… then in the future, if I am still single, on my 30th birthday, Sota, you’ll have to take me as your wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ha?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi, Oi, Oi-Oi, that must be a joke, Konoe-san… You can’t be serious?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious. Because frankly speaking, I don’t think I’ll ever get married. Just think of it as insurance, isn’t it better. Don’t you think so too, Sota?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That may be true, but…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, as long as I pay back the loan, there’s no loss, right? And even if something were to happen to you, Misa is already like family to me. Her personality is a thing, but…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… Okay. I’m fine with it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you insane?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara glared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I just have to give it back! I can get 5,000 points every month easily. I just need to complete two D rank quests, and I’m good to go! I can afford it! I mean it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara looks at me as if she was looking at a worm, please stop.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t look at me like that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it’s okay with you, I don’t have anything to say…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then we have a deal. I’ll save the memorandum, and we’ll perform the magic of the contract later.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, you’re serious! The magic of the contract is something that will kill you if you break it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, well, whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She handed me the glasses, and I put them on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I plucked the strings and injected the magic power, Fujiwara distanced himself from me, hugging her body as if in caution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, no, no. I didn’t want to see you naked. I was simply storing my magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, by the way, there’s something I wanted to ask, Misa.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you make a magic device that separates demons and humans? I want Fujiwara to return back to normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa crossed her arms and groaned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It might be… difficult. I didn’t think that we, as students, could do anything about something that the professionals had tried and said was impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As I thought…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry… And this is not directly related, but I had a few questions about Fujiwara-san’s case. Why did the grimoire burn?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It must have been when Fujiwara was trying to subdue the demon. At that time, the grimoire suddenly caught fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was something I had wondered about too, but we didn’t find the cause in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked back, Fujiwara also shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Misa also said, “I have no basis for this,” before continuing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was wondering if someone had tampered with Fujiwara-san’s grimoire.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean by tampered?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara tilted her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But who did it and for what purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When asked, Misa replied, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I can’t get over the fact that the grimoire burned up clean. I heard that you submitted your grimoire to the school for scrutiny before the summoning exam. And if that’s the case, a third party could have done it if they wanted to, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Fujiwara fell silent, as if thinking about his guess, Misa waved her hand as if in a panic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just a guess without any evidence, so there’s no need to take it that seriously.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I appreciate your opinion. I’ll keep it in mind.”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">After parting ways with Misa, we decided to go to the quest board.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It had now become necessary to check the quest board frequently to see if there were any good ones to start paying off the loan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the way, I wasn’t wearing my glasses at the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara had warned me that she would not allow me to wear them on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She would probably beat me to pulp up if I wore them outside of combat or emergencies. Damn it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the way to the bulletin board, Fujiwara, who was walking next to me, kept furrowing her brow in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you concerned about what Misa said? That there could be someone involved…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara shot a glance at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, as I’ve… said many times, I still can’t believe I made a mistake. I admit that the demon was tough, and I had a hard time with it, but I’m sure I could have dealt with it somehow. In fact, I hadn’t planned to summon such a strong demon in the first place. It’s why so many things are out of place.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. But you know, even if we find the cause, it doesn’t mean things can go back to normal, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re right. It may never be the same again. That’s why if I find out that someone was behind this, I will tear that person to pieces.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t give up. If you can’t get back to normal, it’ll be the end of the line for me too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara did not respond.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She just furrowed her brows again and sank into a sea of thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of us walked in silence for a bit and reached the quest board.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There were unusually few students there, or rather, there was only one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh? Isn’t that Sota-kun and Fujiwara-san? You came here looking for a quest?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the student council president. Her usual dignified expression faded, and she gave me a gentle smile. Compared to Ryoka, who was supposed to be a member of the same western faction, there was a big difference in how she treated us (mainly Fujiwara).</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, yes. Is the president also looking for a quest? I’ve heard rumours that you’ve accumulated enough points to graduate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have good ears. But experience never hurts, does it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Huh, very sophisticated. If I were in your shoes, I’d probably be playing around already.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You seem to be completing quests at a high rate as well. It’s great that you’re still coming back to check the board as usual.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun took out a loan earlier, so he needs some points.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">You idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At Fujiwara’s words, the president’s eyebrows slightly twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not impressed. How many points worth of loans have you taken out?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">There it was. She’s angry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s too fastidious, which is troublesome for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I glared at Fujiwara, but she was looking at the bulletin board with an indifferent expression. Damn it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, you see, it’s just 30,000…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just? Isn’t that too much? Do you have any way to pay it back?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s why I’m here, to look for the quests.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. If that’s the case, then maybe I can tag along so that you can earn money at once and pay it back. I’ll also give you both all the rewards. Now, a quest where you can earn 30,000 points at once will be… A-rank or higher. How about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly grabbed her wrist as she tried to reach for a high-ranked quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s impossible! I could die! You know that sometimes overconfidence can kill! And I can’t afford to trouble you, president!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you being reserved with me? You don’t need to worry about it. I’d be more than happy to go with you, Sota-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, you don’t need to! We’ve only cleared up to D-rank so far! And one was even quite difficult. And yet, an A-rank is too much… Are you trying to kill me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In case you were wondering, our first quest was eventually revised and upgraded to a B-rank, but we can exclude that because it was impossible to accomplish in a regular way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Souta-kun, even though you’re paired with Fujiwara-san, how can a top-notch demon summoner say such things? I’m not impressed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was too high of an evaluation of my abilities!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re overestimating me! I’m a tiny fish! Seriously!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t lower yourself. That’s called self-handicapping.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh my goooood!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t reason with her!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">She wouldn’t understand what it was like to be at the bottom because she thought things in terms of her own talents!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No worries, really. If I earn 5,000 points a month, it won’t be a problem. I can take it easy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mmm. If you say so, I won’t force you… Such a shame…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the president lowered the corner of her eyebrows, looking sad, my heart hurt a little because she was being kind and thoughtful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It hurts, but more than that, I am relieved that she has given up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But then…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, you can go on a C-rank quest with me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka, who had appeared before me, said as she thumped my back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The unexpected shock startled me to the core.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa. When did you…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve been behind you this whole time. What’s with the fishy smell? If you were in need of points, you should have asked me for help. I’m always willing to go on a quest with you, Ashiya-kun. I’m sure you would be more comfortable with me than with an uptight woman like Mari-nee, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ryouka? What do you mean by ‘an uptight woman’?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was a joke, just a joke!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka, in response to the president’s glare, panicked and gave an amiable smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But don’t you think it’s a bit too much to have your senior go with you on your quest to pay off a loan? You see, I’m his rival and in the same year. It would be much easier for me than for Mari-nee. The best part is, the rank we can get is just about right, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Your rival is Fujiwara. Don’t drag me into your fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The president regretfully nodded as if she had been convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Fujiwara, who had been watching from the sidelines, intervened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let alone the president, the idea of going on a quest with you is a joke.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rejected, Ryouka looked back at me…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey Ashiya-kun, your familiar is being very reluctant. What is it, maybe she doesn’t want to go on a quest and have her master see her as inferior to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ha? Are you out of your mind? Who’s inferior to who?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka pointed at Fujiwara with a big smile, then at herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The gesture must have struck Fujiwara’s chords. The smile slipped off her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Scary!</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped if you’re lousy enough to only clear D-rank quests!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ryouka. I told you not to provoke Fujiwara-san like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In response to the president’s warning, Ryouka raised her palm as if to say, “wait.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t mean to make fun of her. I was merely warning her out of the kindness of my heart that she would have a hard time in the future if she behaved like a sore loser. I’m on top, and she is below. Even an animal could understand the order of things. Else it would be too pitiful…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was then I heard a crack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s eyes changed colour at the blatant provocation. They went from black to crimson, and she took a fighting stance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt as if my back would shatter from the magic power being sucked out of me through the supply circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara laughed, “Kufufu,” with a smile on his face and eyes that radiated black magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun. Why don’t you let this misunderstood woman know the reality?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I answered half-automatically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I still can’t. I can’t do a C-rank.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the murderous gaze directed at Ryouka landed on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That kind of gaze shouldn’t be directed at me, your hypothetical ally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My whole body instantly shuddered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t do it. But I was scared of her…</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked back at Ryoka, I saw that she was smiling in a cold sweat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha-ha, did your wild instincts get the better of you? As expected of a barbarian.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Stop provoking her even more. Do you not have brakes or something?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Please, if you’re going to crash, don’t drag us along with you.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked over at the president to ask for help, but she watched from the sidelines with eyes that seemed to imply that things couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had given up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey Ashiya-kun, why can’t you? I’m not the kind of magician who would struggle with a mere C-rank, am I? Or do you think that a mere C-rank is too much for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No-no-no. You know, if you could fully master the power of that demoness, I think you’d be able to clear a mere C-rank with ease. I-I think you could have cleared it if you were like before too. But now, the situation is that my ability to use magic… is not up to par. So, this time, I would like to stay quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. So, you mean that if I teach you how to use more magic power, you’ll reconsider, right, Ashiya-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Hurry up, Ryouka! Which quest do you want to go on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I chickened out. I was more afraid of Fujiwara than the quest right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? D-don’t ask me, Ah! I guess…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka got startled when I directed the question at her, and she quickly ripped off a sheet of paper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think this one would be great.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Crosspoint Recovery.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Destroy a small foreign world contact point that has appeared in the first layer of the Forbidden Zone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Difficulty level: C</p>
<p class="calibre4">Limit of people: Unlimited.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Reward: 100,000 yen + 20,000 points (excluding expenses)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Note: Many low-grade monsters are hiding in the first layer of the Forbidden Zone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For details, please contact the Student Affairs Division.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked at the quest that Ryouka was holding and immediately knew it’d be a pain. With a C-rank quest, we wouldn’t have to do anything stupid like killing thought entities or magical beasts. The reward for this was also a jump, but this is also dangerous. It’d definitely be painful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fine with me. I’ve been thinking about going to the Forbidden Zone myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was eager to go… and couldn’t say a word about me not wanting to…!</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Ashiya-kun. About tomorrow…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was cleaning up after dinner at the sink, Fujiwara interrupted out of the blue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I turned around after turning off the faucet, my eyes met hers. Fujiwara had a bath towel wrapped around her head like a turban.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her cheeks were flushed, probably because she had just finished taking a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s up?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just wanted to check in with you briefly about the quest. Is it okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had just finished washing the dishes, so I nodded, and Fujiwara, who had been applying some sort of serum to her face, stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shoved the wet dishes into the dryer, turned the dryer on, and headed toward Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sat down on the sofa across the mini-table.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, by the way, was sitting flat on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun, this is the first time you’ve been to the Forbidden Area outside of class, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. To be honest, I’m dreading it. Why don’t we cancel it now after all?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You idiot. It’s only the first level of the Forbidden Zone, so there’s nothing to be afraid of.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Forbidden Zone is the general term for the special area surrounding the inter-dimensional tunnels called the Crosspoint that connects to the other world. They are divided into five layers, and the higher the number, the closer to the Crosspoint it is. Its structure is similar to that of rings or contour lines. [EN: Think of a bullseye target where the center is Crosspoint, and each ring is a layer.]</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first layer was at the outer edge, and the fifth layer was at the deepest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure what the layers are like, but it’s still crawling with thought entities and monsters. If I were as sturdy as you, I’d be able to afford it, but I’m just a weak, ordinary human being.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The first layer only has small fries, so even your poor magic is enough to compete with them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Basically, there are a lot of monsters roaming around in the Forbidden Zone. The monsters tend to get stronger the deeper you go, and as Fujiwara said, the first layer was only supposed to have low-grade monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And it’s clearly stated that if you have a temporary license, you’re good enough to go up to the second layer, so don’t complain or goof off. As long as you live as a Sorcerer for a living, you can’t escape the Forbidden Zone anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, but it’s too soon. We only got our provisional licenses a month or so ago. Normally, an F- or E-rank quest, or even a D-rank, are enough to stretch your legs.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you please not lump me in with those meagre students? I’m already good enough for a B- or even an A-rank quest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">You failed the summoning exam, yet you’re so pompous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I point it out, she will definitely get angry. So, I won’t say it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And I heard that Ryouka has already completed a C-rank quest. That means I can afford to do it too. There is nothing that she can do that I can’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop lying. There are so many things that Ryouka can do that you can’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa? Like what?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such as visually pleasing males with her ample b*****s, or her character…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hm?!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I held up my hands and said, “I’m kidding!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s a joke, but Fujiwara, you have a big handicap that is me, so you shouldn’t be too hasty with everything. Just so you know, I’ll only drag you down with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s right, I’m carrying a carbon dioxide emitter called Ashiya-kun right now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha. You’ve got a big mouth.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite those words, Fujiwara put her hand on her forehead as if she was aware of her faux pas. [EN: embarrassing remark in a social situation.]</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It seems that living with Ashiya-kun is having an unpleasant effect on me. I have to be careful.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t blame others. Your bad mouth is a manifestation of your innate bad character.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Anyway, complaining about it now won’t change anything, so give it up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t say no because it was impossible to persuade Fujiwara now that she was like this. I’ve been living with her for about a month now, and she has made me understand this painfully. There was no point in arguing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m always the one who’s at the losing end. It’s frustrating.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes. Well, that’s all I have to say. Protect me with your steel body, will you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s natural for a familiar to protect her summoner, but when you say it like that, the scumminess stands out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scornful look on her face did not do any damage. I have already gotten used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara heaved a small sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can at least destroy the inter-dimensional contact point, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It depends on the scale, but this time it seems to be small. I can probably do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">An inter-dimensional contact point is a place where two worlds connect. It is said that it’d be bad for three worlds to overlap at one point. As the name suggests, a peculiar region around them, called the Forbidden Area, will be created, and in the worst case, the world will collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, contact points tend to attract more worlds, so it gets even more out of control.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Incidentally, one of the main duties of a sorcerer is to destroy these inter-dimensional contact points.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, I’ll leave the destruction of the contact point to you this time, Ashiya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh. So, you’ll escort us on the way in, as I thought it’s because of her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. I’m sure that woman will be messing with me during the quest, and I may have to deal with that anyway, so it’d be a great help if you could at least do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It doesn’t matter what she’ll do, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara huffed as she said that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were both on the same page, but she was overestimating Ryouka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, well. That’s all I have to say about tomorrow. I’m going to dry my hair.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara got up and went near the washbasin. I soon heard the shrill sound of a hairdryer and a small humming in the background. I didn’t know what she was humming. Maybe it was a war song? I took a breath and leaned back against the couch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but let out a sigh of anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was my first C-rank quest, and now, we added Ryouka, who has the worst chemistry with Fujiwara, to the group.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t mix two opposite elements, or there will be consequences. It was a predictable future.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh my god… I hoped one of them would take a sick leave…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s about time, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was writhing alone, Fujiwara came back after drying her hair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without waiting for my reply, she crawled on all fours and inserted the DVD.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the sight of her hips pointed at me through her pyjamas, I almost pulled out Zeus No. 1 as a reflex.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I bit my lower lip and desperately summoned up my reason to try and hold on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Calm down, Souta Ashiya. This is Chikage Fujiwara’s hips we are talking about. It’s against your pride to lust after something like that. Calm your mind… Alright, let’s get rid of the thoughts!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was thinking something stupid when Fujiwara crowded in right next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To my annoyance, she smelled good after bathing. This wasn’t fair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara flicked on the remote control, and a Western movie played on the big TV screen. It was a romance movie that had become a hot topic a while ago that she had rented at a rental store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara held out one of her hands to me with her eyes fixed on the TV, and I grasped it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt the warmth of her hand. We intertwined our fingers together to increase the contact as much as possible. Fujiwara’s slender fingers tightened around the back of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We watched the movie in silence, neither of us said a word.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the screen, foreign actors were happily enjoying their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the movie was about halfway through, Fujiwara muttered, “How beautiful. I adore this kind of love.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s voice was enchanting, something I would normally not have thought to be possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I learned after we started living together that Fujiwara was a fan of romantic movies and girls’ comics. She seems to be more interested in romance than most people. I’m not saying it didn’t suit her, but it was surprising.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. If you can get rid of the summoner contract, you can enjoy romantic movies like this as much as you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop it, don’t pull me back to reality. Ashiya-kun, that kind of thinking is bad. You can’t even say anything sensible at a time like this. This is why you’ll never get a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right now, the two of us, a man and a woman, were holding hands while watching a romantic movie in the room where we live alone.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0YDvcXT/000006.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">There was nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, I regret to say that I am aware that this situation is typical of a couple.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But let me get this straight. I swear to God, we are not flirting. [EN: Sure, buddy.]</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was just supplying the magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What was wrong was my magic circuit. It’s too weak. With such a faulty circuit that seemed like a hose full of holes, a huge amount of magic power was used just to maintain Fujiwara’s normal appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why I was doing this to reduce the burden. By holding hands, Fujiwara could make sure that the magic power, though small, flows in without loss, without relying on the circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it was hard to hold her hand for a long time without doing anything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was why we eventually decided to watch a movie during the magic power transfer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">See? We’re not flirting at all. It’s the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Self-brainwashing is important.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Two hours later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Amid mild fatigue, the movie ended, and the end credits started to play.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa, it was really good. It made me want to fall in love, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I agree.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded in agreement with Fujiwara, who looked pleased with the movie and began to tell me her opinions about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded and listened to her. If I didn’t give a proper opinion once in a while, she’d get in a bad mood, which was the most troublesome thing. I got used to it, though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Fujiwara. It’s about time you saw something other than a romantic movie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the conversation had settled down, I made a suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara panicked and gave me a subtle look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind, but I don’t like action or horror at all. It’s not even funny.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At this point, if I replied, “Actually, I don’t like romantic movies as much as I used to!” it would normally lead to a fight, but I held my ground. You can’t take back everything you say.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh well. Sometimes it’s good to watch a movie that you’re not interested in, like eating junk food. Also, some action movies involve romantic scenes. You should try it out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… Well, okay. Then let’s pick one of those next week.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">We get used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Initially, it was hard for us to get along, and if anything went wrong, we cursed at each other, but now if there was a request that we really wanted to get through, we thought about it first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I thought about the fact that I couldn’t even live a satisfactory life without Fujiwara’s approval, I felt like dying at night. Yet, there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides, even Fujiwara would sometimes take a backseat when necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And by the way, Fujiwara is very creepy when she is like that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the end, this is what living together is all about… I don’t know why I was so enlightened when I wasn’t even living with my girlfriend. Isn’t it possible that I’ve skipped some stage in my life?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt like crying.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">The more you want to avoid, the quicker it’ll come.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the next day. After the recess, we went straight to the Forbidden Zone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our team consists of three members: Fujiwara, Ryoka, and me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re students of the International Mage Association, here to participate in the mission to destroy the inter-dimensional contact point. Here’s our permission slip.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The entire Forbidden Zone was covered by a powerful warding system. To enter, you have to show a permit to the administrator.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I showed the permit issued by the school to the person in charge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes, I’ve heard about you. This way, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man handed me a terminal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a tablet device with a large liquid crystal display, a kind of magical instrument. On the screen was a map of the first layer, with the location of the contact point, our destination, marked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The map kinda looked like a donut with the entire centre area blackened. Once we approached that area, we would be in the second layer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The first layer’s monsters aren’t too strong, but don’t let your guard down. There are still many of them. If anything happens, please send out a rescue signal from that terminal. Once we receive the signal, we will send help immediately.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man said as he operated the console in the choke point and opened the gate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A huge, magically-treated iron door, several tens of centimetres thick, opened with a bang.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Forbidden Zone was doubly enclosed by large walls and magical barriers, separating it from the outside world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In addition, many students have come to the first layer for quests today, so if you are going to use area magic, please make sure to check your surroundings. If you check your terminal, green markers will appear on the screen, indicating the location of other terminals in the Forbidden Zone, or in other words, other sorcerers, so please refer to it prior to doing it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I operated the terminal, nearly forty green markers appeared on the map on the screen. There were indeed many. However, because the first layer is large, the density is not that high, and there are not many markers around my destination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Have a good day.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When prompted, the three of us walked through the gate side by side, and a few moments later, the massive door closed behind us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What I saw before was a desolate cityscape, weathered from exposure to the elements.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, this Forbidden Zone was now but a shadow of its former self. Before the advent of Crosspoint, it used to be a busy shopping district with many people. The skyscrapers and the wide multi-lane roads were an eloquent testament to this past.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, it was strange how much the place had decayed, even though it must have been less than twenty years since it appeared. Maybe the flow of time was different from the outside due to the boundary interference. I think I heard something like that in class, I think?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a hazy memory because I wasn’t taking it seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what’s with the glasses?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I put on the Zeus I brought, Ryoka asked me in an amused tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This? It’s a magic tank. My friend in engineering made it for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s unusual for you to wear glasses. Though, it looks quite good on you. Definitely a handsome face.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka flattered me, but I wondered what her reaction would be if she found out that it had an obscene clairvoyant function. At the very least, she would withdraw her tomboyish nature.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ain’t gonna say it and I ain’t gonna use it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How could I waste my magic power in such a dangerous place? If I indulge in these desires for too long, I’ll run out of magic power when the time comes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, where’s the inter-dimensional contact point?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara asked as she looked into the terminal I was holding.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, the map says it’s more than three kilometres away. It’s going to take quite a while to get there on foot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The blue marker that indicated our location and the red marker, our destination, were quite far apart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Well, we should just take it easy. We’ll go slowly through the areas where there are few monsters, destroy the inter-dimensional contact point, and go home. It’s perfect for a stroll. Besides, I don’t mind the atmosphere here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, come on, that’s just too boring,” Ryoka said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ve come all this way to find out who’s better. I’ll leave the destruction of the contact points to Ashiya-kun of the Department of Boundary Interference, and we can compete in the number of monsters we can hunt.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I don’t mind, but doesn’t that put me at a disadvantage since I can’t stay away from Ashiya-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara pointed out, and Ryoka cowered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re not serious? You’re not the only one who’s at a disadvantage. You have the foul power of the demon, and I’m just a human being, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I don’t wanna ask any further. Who’d have thought that the top-brass in the East are cowards? After all, I’m known in the West as the tolerant Ryouka-nee-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara clucked her tongue at Ryoka, who laughed at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you insist, I’ll deal with it. I’ve been wanting to settle things with you. I don’t want you to think you’re better than me because you’re wrong about the facts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka clapped her hands happily at Fujiwara, who replied to her selling words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s great! Now that we’ve got that out of the way, how about a bet?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? Like, whoever wins gets all the money?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That would be interesting, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Ryoka glanced at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I win, I’ll get Ashiya-kun. He has to join the West and become my right-hand man.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Huh, me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Did you have multiple screws loose?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had been keeping quiet because it was their matter, but now they were dragging me in…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi-Oi. Give me a break!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I smiled and refused, but Ryoka put her arm around my shoulders and held me close.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know how much Mari adores you, right? I wonder what kind of face she’ll make if I take you under my wing? It’ll be very interesting, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? You and the president don’t get along well?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka gave a shady smile at my question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just that the people around her, who think she’ll be the future head of the Sanjo family and believe that she deserves it, are not very nice. After all, thanks to her, I’m always treated as an accessory. Even my parents are telling me that I have to support Mari in the future. It’s just unfair.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It is fair,” Fujiwara stated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The difference between you and the president is as great as that between heaven and earth in terms of your capabilities and natural talent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unusually, Ryouka didn’t say anything back. In fact, she even smiled self-deprecatingly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, I admit that she’s too good. I’m no match for her in terms of magical talent, but that doesn’t mean that I should be under her thumb unconditionally. I’m going to stab that woman with something other than talent. I’m going to take control of the Sanjo family and eventually the West Japan branch.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka whispered in my ears, “And I need you to do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Me? Why?</p>
<p class="calibre4">… Oh, because of Fujiwara…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I suppose this girl wants Fujiwara, who has the power of a demon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, I don’t think a guy like me would be of any use to Ryouka’s high road.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you being modest? Ashiya-kun, if you choose me, I promise I won’t hurt you. I’ll do anything for you. I’ll even make you my lifelong companion if you want. Not only will you have a position in the West, but you’ll also be the husband of the head of the Sanjo family. Besides, if I do say so myself, I’m pretty good, aren’t I?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The feel of her b*****s pressed against my back. What a cheap trick. Only a fool would be lured to such a thing. But, but, but this was more bountiful than expected…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I should just be an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I got dizzy, Fujiwara grabbed me by the neck and pulled me away from Ryoka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is a challenge between you and me. Ashiya-kun has nothing to do with it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa. The owner has to take the responsibility for the misbehaviour of the familiar. Or are you just bullshitting me because you have no chance of winning? Huh. Who’d have thought that Chikage Fujiwara is such a coward!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Okay. I’ll take you up on that cheap provocation. But when I win, you’ll remember me. I’ll make you regret that you were ever born.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was still about me, but the conversation was going on without my intervention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute. I won’t join any faction…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I tried to break the strange flow, Fujiwara stared at me as if I were an idiot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we don’t lose, there’s no problem, so what are you complaining about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um, you see…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? So, you think I’m going to lose, Ashiya-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have no idea how good you two are. I’m just a small fish. But even if Fujiwara is better than her, it’s not like you could win ten times out of ten, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There is. If we fight ten times, I’ll win ten times, and if I do it a hundred times, I’ll win a hundred times then. That’s how superior I am to her. And now that I have the power of a demon, there is no way that I can lose.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Are you a child? Fujiwara’s assertion was just cringy, but as expected, Ryouka seemed to be offended by the direct condescension and let out a laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I’m talking about! Talk big while you still can! If I get Ashiya-kun, you, his servant, will automatically become mine too! I’ll discipline you well on Ashiya-kun’s behalf!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa? Don’t count your eggs before they’re hatched. On the contrary, I will teach you the harshness of reality to the marrow of your bones.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And thus, the two brilliant women were ready to cut each other’s throats.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In front of the power of the woman staring at me with blue streaks in her eyes, I couldn’t say anything, nor would I be listened to. Maybe I’ll get punched out if I interrupt her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, s**t! Fujiwara, I’m really counting on you! Don’t lose!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Foolish question. You have a magic tank this time, so I can afford it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara waved her hand and glared at Ryouka.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what are the rules?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no point in making complicated rules. The one who hunts more monsters and magical beasts before Ashiya-kun arrives at his destination should be the winner, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, but that’s a bit too simple. The regulations…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s simple enough, you know. In a way, Ashiya-kun is like an hourglass.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With Fujiwara’s approval, Ryoka continued, “Oh, right. As long as we walk at a steady pace, Ashiya-kun can help Fujiwara in any way he wants. In any case, a summoner and their familiar are a pair. In return, I will be allowed to hunt off the path. It’ll be disadvantageous to be next to a demon all the time. Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind. How are we going to handle thought entities?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No need to fight them. It’d be useless because we can’t prove we defeated one. So, while hunting, you should collect evidence that you have defeated the monsters, such as… a corpse, or if that’s too much trouble, you can use harvested parts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, the conversation came to an end, and the two of them began to do some preparatory exercises to get into the spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While Fujiwara stretched carefully, Ryouka circulated her magic power through her body while equipping herself with a magic device that looked like a brass knuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, a red geometric pattern appeared on Ryouka’s entire body. It seemed to be a physical type of magic formation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you imprinting the formation directly onto your body?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I asked, and Ryouka smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I’m the type of magic warrior who specializes in close-range combat. I’ll kill any enemy that stands in my way head-on with my well-trained fists and magic that improves my physical abilities. Isn’t that cool?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, she continued exercising by shadowboxing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her fists were so fast that I could see afterimages. She was frighteningly powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s get started.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a word from Fujiwara, we started walking towards our destination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I compared the map displayed on my device with the city streets that had been invaded by nature.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe those buildings in the distance are our destination.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re really far away, aren’t we…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if Fujiwara had noticed something, she turned her eyes to the side of the road where weeds had grown thickly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a black dog-like creature walking on two hind legs, baring its teeth and threatening us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a kobold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed that a monster had immediately appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as she saw it, Ryouka ran and approached her prey like the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was hard to follow with my eyes, so fast that it approached the limit of human speed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Fujiwara was even faster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She literally passed Ryouka with unbelievable speed and kicked the kobold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic power on her toes traced a blue trail that turned the upper half of Kobold’s body into a plume of blood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was just a kick, yet its power far surpassed the offensive magic of ordinary magicians.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka, having lost her target, almost fell down on her knees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But somehow, she managed to stay on her feet and stared at Fujiwara dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Apparently, this was the first time she had seen the current, non-summoner Fujiwara fight in person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, with her eyes dyed vermilion, looked back at Ryouka with a smile of pride.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is what I call an unchangeable and absolute difference. So, Ryouka Sanjo, do you still want to do it? If you admit defeat right here and now and get down on your knees, I might be able to forgive you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As if I’d do that!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka shouted but quickly took a deep breath to calm herself down, smiling awkwardly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haha, don’t act as if you’ve won. Without the power of that demon, you’re nothing. Such a shame.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What a sore loser. Well, if you want to continue, let’s move on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka ignored the victorious Fujiwara and looked back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun. I’m sorry, but can you go on ahead? I’m pissed off, but I don’t think I can win in a head-to-head competition with this monster right now. I’m going to hunt the monsters down somewhere else as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I could reply, Ryouka effortlessly ran up the outer wall of a nearby building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I guess she was planning to look for prey from a height. Even so, she has incredible mobility.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was out of her league, but Ryouka was also skilled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah! She ran away with her tail between her legs. It’s been a while since I’ve felt this good.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara said with a refreshing smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Follow me! Let’s hunt down more monsters and show her the difference between us”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh. You’ll be like the Grim Reaper to the monsters.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Yeah, that’s right. I mean, they feed on people.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For some reason, low intelligence monsters, called hexenbiests, relentlessly attack humans. Hence, when ordinary people, who don’t have any means to defend themselves, are attacked, they are usually helplessly killed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not often that hexenbiests appear outside the forbidden zone, but still, more than a few people are killed every year. So, let’s take care of more of them at this time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If we can reduce the number of victims, even if only by a little, it’ll be great.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If only that irritating woman would learn to behave herself and become more mature!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara said as she beat a kobold to death that had appeared in her direction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As proof of defeat, a part of its ear was snapped off and collected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, the two of you have been going at it since freshman year.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara and Ryoka’s relationship was well known throughout the school. There were probably no students who didn’t know about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a one-sided grudge. I know I’m better than her, so I don’t push. I mean, she’s just wrestling with herself, screaming and yelling.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was too afraid to agree with her, so I just nodded vaguely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And to be honest, I didn’t trust Fujiwara too much when it came to this argument. This was because I, of all people, had been involved in a one-sided dispute with Fujiwara when I was a freshman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It wouldn’t be surprising if Ryouka got some flak from Fujiwara, just like I had during the summoning test. Well, the opposite is also true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You look like you want to say something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered if my thoughts were showing on my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, no. I was just remembering why Fujiwara was so persistent with me when I was a freshman. You were like a mother telling me to work harder, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara raised an eyebrow in slight disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She put her hand over her mouth as if searching for words and looked at me with difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, she sighed exaggeratedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… It’s frustrating to watch people who have talent but don’t want to take advantage of it, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, come on, you’re talking like the president again. Can’t you see the truth?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I replied with a hint of sarcasm, Fujiwara gave me a momentary inexplicable look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if she was trying to hold something back… Well, it was really for just a moment, so maybe I’m just looking at it wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“At the very least, I need you to do well right now because your performance, or lack thereof, will affect my evaluation. Rather, I think Ashiya-kun is too unmotivated in general.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not like you. I don’t have any goals in mind. My ideal goal is to work a moderate amount, earn a moderate salary, and live comfortably without taking on heavy responsibilities.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know, now that you’re my partner, you have to change this gutless mindset of yours.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara stated as she obliterated the upper body of an insect-shaped monster that appeared in the distance with a magic bullet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I hope I can deal with it positively. But you know what they say, a person’s character never changes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t give me that pathetic excuse…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time Fujiwara plucked materials from the defeated monsters, something fell from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hello! I’m here for the report!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The one who landed in front of me with a thud was Ryoka, who was holding monster parts in both arms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve hunted down about five of them. Here’s the proof.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She threw the heads, tails and unidentifiable jewel-like objects onto the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was surprised and checked the materials with Fujiwara, and there were indeed five of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Five monsters in such a short time? That’s awesome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What c**p…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps because her ego was tickled by my reaction, Ryoka proudly put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’m good at hunting. My skills are not just for show. Now then, Fujiwara, how many of them did you kill? Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Three of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara replied, looking like she was about to bite her lip off, and Ryoka deliberately put her hand over her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh no, this is unexpected! I can’t believe that Chikage Fujiwara, who has the power of a demon and an overwhelming advantage over me, can’t hunt as many monsters as I can! I wonder how something so outrageous could happen! Guess the power of a demon is no big deal if the user is useless. Ahahaha…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s face turned serious just as Ryoka started laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at her expression made me want to run away in fear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun. Let’s move on. It’s time to get serious about the hunt.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oya? What, you’ve been holding back? I’m sorry about that! Just because I’m at a bit of a disadvantage, you’ve done me such a great service! Thanks to you, it looks like I’m one step ahead! I’m so thankful for your help!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara walked forward, ignoring Ryoka’s mocking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mmm, ha-ha-ha! I feel so refreshed! Well, Ashiya-kun, I’ll be back!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryoka patted me on the shoulder and once again effortlessly ran up the outer wall of a nearby building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the blink of an eye, her figure disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly chased after Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi, this is bad! She’s really good at hunting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know. You’re right. I was a little lazy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her voice had a hint of impatience in it while she glanced at me before looking away, hesitating.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Ashiya-kun. Can you use the clairvoyant function of those glasses right now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked her about her intentions, Fujiwara moved her mouth in a squirming motion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I was wondering if you could see through buildings and look for monsters nearby…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, I get it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded and concentrated my magic power in my right eye to activate the clairvoyant function.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The amount of magic in the tank was sufficient to make the substance in view completely transparent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I walked, I looked around and spotted a man-eating rabbit behind a decaying wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There are two rabbits in the back there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I pointed it out, Fujiwara punched through the wall and knocked down the two man-eating rabbits behind it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Two broken tails were then thrown at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hold that. What else?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, there’s a snake-shaped demon behind the trees over there…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara manipulated her magic power into a blade shape and shot it at the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The tree, which seemed to have a diameter of 50 centimetres, was snapped in two, and the snake-shaped demon died.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s next? Where do I go next?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, wait, wait! I’m looking… Oh, there’s a bunch of kobolds over there! And there are a lot! About four of them!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Got it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, with her limbs covered in magic, lunged in the direction I instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon after, I heard the cries of the kobolds, but they soon stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Covered in blood, Fujiwara returned with the kobolds’ tails.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re lucky. Now we can kill more at ease.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I guess so. Let’s see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was looking around for the monsters, Fujiwara poked me on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It seems that those glasses are nice and handy, but you’re not looking at my naked body, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not looking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t have time to reply, but the truth was that Fujiwara’s naked body was right in front of my eyes. But I didn’t have any guilty feelings, so I’m safe. I’m not in the mood either.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara pushes the kobold tails into my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I hope you’re not lying…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was about to have my hands full, so I shoved the terminal and grimoire into my backpack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Ashiya-kun, you seem to be very close to Konoe-san, who made those glasses. You have known each other since… childhood, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She asked me as we proceeded to hunt sporadically appearing monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, yeah. We’ve known each other since before we started elementary school. You see, our masters were good friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. So, by that time, you already…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara muttered, but I couldn’t hear her well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her expressions were strangely serious for an unimportant small talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if she was trying to ascertain something important.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara, what about you? Do you have a childhood friend or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Me? I, well… I don’t have a childhood friend, but I did have a fiancé.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seriously?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s amazing. That’s the Fujiwara family for you. Their level is different in every way. What kind of guy was it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara opened her mouth to say something, but it immediately went rigid.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what’s up?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… No. My fiancé was a boy of the same age. He was… a gifted sorcerer, hardworking, brilliant, kind, and… yes, the complete opposite of Ashiya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s great. Sounds like a h**l of a good person, but why are you talking in the past tense?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara glanced at me and replied shortly,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re not like that anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oops.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well… I’m sorry for your loss.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara looked up at the sky with a sigh. When I looked up, I saw that Ryoka had just landed right in front of us, lifting a cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly turned off the translucent function of my glasses, but Ryouka’s naked body, which I could see only for a moment, was surprisingly toned, and I was almost lost in its wild animal-like beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka, who had her arms full of the monster’s remains, smiled smugly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Report!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she released the monster’s material she was holding. The furs and heads rolled haphazardly on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I counted and found out that she had killed about six more of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you think, Ashiya-kun? I do pretty well, don’t I?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Fujiwara answered, “Then it’s our turn.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara released a piece of monster flesh in front of Ryouka, who didn’t doubt her lead position in the slightest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tossed the material I was holding as well, and Ryoka froze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We got ten. It’s a complete turnaround.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara was proud of her victory, even though she hid the fact that we used the clairvoyant function of my glasses. I felt a little guilty, but it’s not a foul since the use of magic items was not forbidden.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, you’re kidding…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can’t you believe what you’ve seen with your own eyes? That’s no good. Why don’t you go to an ophthalmologist or neurosurgeon immediately?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka ground her teeth grimly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, the win is still up for grabs…! I’ll soon overtake you…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she ran up the abandoned building again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What a hardworking girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… Let’s continue.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara urged me to go on.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">The competition between Fujiwara and Ryoka was fierce.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Fujiwara hunted five monsters, Ryouka hunted five more, and Fujiwara, inspired by that, hunted fifteen monsters, causing Ryouka to hunt another fifteen…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Both of them slaughtered monsters without batting an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though our side was making full use of the demon’s power and the clairvoyant glasses, we were still unable to pull off Ryouka, who was by herself!</p>
<p class="calibre4">She kept on catching up no matter how much we got. In terms of hunting, Ryouka’s talent may be far superior to Fujiwara’s.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara would never admit it, but,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“C**p. I can’t believe it’s a draw,” Fujiwara admitted, slightly out of breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We arrived at our destination, an abandoned building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah… Hah… I thought I was gonna win,” Ryouka said, who had beads of sweat all over her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was in a state of exhaustion, her hands on her hips as she looked up at the sky and caught her breath. Just by looking at them, I could tell Fujiwara was the one with the most stamina left. However, it wouldn’t matter if the number of monsters hunted remained the same.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it. It was my chance to bring in Ashiya-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In spite of saying so, Ryouka easily accepted the draw. It seems like there’s more to her character.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, it was fine. There was nothing wrong with Ryouka’s understanding of things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We quickly entered the abandoned building. According to the information displayed on the terminal, the inter-dimensional contact point was located in this abandoned building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This way. I can feel the magic disturbance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara pointed to the stairs, and we headed upstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we approached the fourth floor, even the insensitive me could feel the contact point nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it on this floor?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe. Oh, look. Over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara led the way, and we stepped into a large, cramped room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The distortion connecting to a different world was in the middle of a room, surrounded by walls in ruins.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic in the air was swirling, and images from the other side were being projected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A grassy field with the horizon visible in the distance. A frigid sea with its mountainous ice masses. A sky where dragons fly in packs. A cityscape of sub-humans coming and going… These scenes mixed and floated in the center of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed like there was a fracture in space, through which we were able to peer into another world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Inter-dimensional contact point. A peculiar place in space where the three worlds connect and soon become a ‘Foreign World.’</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What happens if we leave it like this and all three worlds completely connect?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. Well, at the very least, the whole area around it will be destroyed. Want to give it a try?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shook my head at Ryoka, who seemed somewhat mischievous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wasn’t joking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not going to try it. I don’t know why this kind of thing even exists.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“True. But you see, magic appeared in this world through crosspoint. And the inter-dimensional contact points are also created because of the crosspoint. I think the otherworldly contact points are probably a necessity. I don’t even want to think of a world where no sorcerers were born.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka smiled and held out her hand to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll leave the inter-dimensional contact point to you. I’ll take care of the device since it may get in the way of your work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took her word for it and left the device with Ryoka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took out my grimoire from the backpack, placed my palm on the cover and sent magic power into it. Six magic circles appeared, up, down, left, right, front and back, surrounding the twisting space, or the point of contact with the other world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the magic formation I had learned in class at the school to destroy the inter-dimensional contact points.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s going to take a while, so you can just kill some time,” I called out to the two girls behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the first time I was doing this, so it was going to take some time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With two short replies, I closed my eyes and concentrated on the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Little by little, my senses disappeared, and my consciousness focused completely on the formation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All I had to do was to feed the magic power into the grimoire, but it was difficult to get it just right…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, I felt a tingling sensation in my brain, as if an electric current was flowing through me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I saw six magic circles emitting a strong light engulfing the inter-dimensional contact point when I opened my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Phew. Yes, it worked.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the light from the magic circles subsided, there was no more distortion of space. Perfect.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s Ashiya-kun for you. You’ve done a splendid job. I would have never been able to do this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned around to see Ryouka smirking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I knew it, Fujiwara was standing next to her with her arms crossed, looking at me with a bored look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You did well. Now, let’s go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I reached out to take the device from Ryouka, she avoided me with a flick of her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What is it? Were you going to hold it for me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if to ridicule the thought of me being so carefree…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, wait for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka threw the terminal into the air and smashed it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The terminal cracked in half and fell to the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… You, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was stunned by the sudden outburst, geometric patterns and bright red magic circuits appeared on Ryouka’s whole body. It was the activation of magic. But why?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if she’s about to start a fight…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You see, I can’t afford to have you send out a rescue signal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt an unsettling atmosphere and prepared myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara stepped forward to protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka didn’t answer but said, “Come,” with a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, behind Ryouka, a group of people in uniforms like ours appeared from the room’s entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were students from the school. They were Ryouka’s cronies, who belonged to the west faction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I saw more than a dozen magic warriors alongside summoners with their monsters… All of them were ready to attack.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oi. Did you just set us up?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The voice that came out of my mouth was surprisingly calm, even compared to my usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, Ashiya-kun, please don’t say inappropriate things. I’m very sad when you say things like that. It is just a continuation of the game. Fujiwara and I had a draw, didn’t we? But there’s still one monster left. That’s right. If I defeat that one, I’ll win by a narrow margin.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka’s smirking gaze fixed on Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, the remaining monster was Fujiwara, who fused with the demon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This girl…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I knew something was wrong from the start,” Fujiwara said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how good you are at hunting, there’s no way you can keep up with me. I see how it is. You’ve been letting your men help you. That’s why you were able to hunt at such a fast pace.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Hey, hey! Please don’t make such accusations. Where’s your proof? I fought fair and square, okay? Against the two of you, all by myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara retorted with an empty excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, because you didn’t win the game as expected, you’re just going to whine about it? Childish.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka ignored Fujiwara and looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Ashiya-kun. Be mine. If you accept now, I won’t have to be so rough with you. You know you’re outnumbered. I planned all this way to make sure that you won’t have much left in you. Just give up now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you crazy? Do you think I will agree with just this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s your fault for not losing the game quietly. If you had, I wouldn’t have had to be so rough with you. I need power, power to beat that woman. I’ll do anything to get that. I don’t care what I have to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was a conversation we shouldn’t be having.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t care about your selfish desires. I’m going to report this matter to the academy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t let you do that. If that’s the case, I’m afraid I’ll have to keep your mouth shut.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka raised her hand goofily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if on cue, the people behind her took a stance. Their hostility was apparent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was bad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how strong Fujiwara was, it was reckless to take on this many people.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My magic tank was already low on magic. What were we supposed to do…?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara. Can you run to the exit carrying me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we can get through this, I suppose I can…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As if I’ll let you go. Throw away your grimoire unless you want us to attack you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Things were not looking good. The tension was palpable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If only we could get through this moment…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun, don’t listen to her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara, step aside…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I lightly pushed Fujiwara off to the side as she stood in front of me to protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, facing Ryouka in a straight line, I slowly bent my knees and placed the grimoire on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I love a smart man. Ashiya-kun, you are most welcome,” Ryouka said in a good mood as if she thought I had given up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">You fool. Who’s going to join your faction?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I looked down to place the grimoire on the floor, I concentrated my magic power on both eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the surface of the lenses, magic power ran through the magic circuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard a slight noise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a hint of Fujiwara coming up behind me as if she sensed my intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ryouka.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I called out to her, still looking down and keeping my finger on the grimoire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t assume that things will go as you planned.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? What’s with the attitude? Don’t tell me you’re trying to fight with us,” She commented in a dubious yet mischievous voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked down and continued.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know what? I actually admire the fact that even if you’re no match for the president in terms of strength, you’re still trying. I’m serious. I don’t have that kind of guts. I think you and Fujiwara are similar in that respect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please stop with your evaluation. I don’t enjoy it. Just get your hands off the grimoire.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, it’s just that… The only difference between you and Fujiwara is a crucial one. It’s the integrity of your spirit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara also has huge ambitions, but not just for herself. She tries to push up the people around her as well. I’m sure she’s doing it for others. But you’re different, aren’t you? You don’t care about the rest as long as it’s good for you, do you? You are selfish. I can’t stand being caught up in your selfishness.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka’s voice was laced with irritation. But there seemed to be no sense of danger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m sure she never dreamed that I would be the one to rebel against her under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ll never be able to beat Fujiwara or the President, you know. Besides…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m… selfish, a selfish b*****d. You think I’ll be under you You think you can do whatever you want to me. I hate you the most in the world.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shouted and looked up into her eyes through the lens of the glowing circuitry.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jhsTrWC/000001.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“Ryouka! If you don’t want to die, defend yourself with all your might!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a snap, my glasses electrified.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it intuition, or was it instinct? Ryouka crossed her arms with a snap and took a defensive stance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next moment, a thick pillar of light shot out from one of the lenses.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was hit by the “divine lightning” and was blown away, along with her followers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Buzz, buzz, buzz!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The electricity that had been stagnant in the air disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara!”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just as I called out, Fujiwara held me from behind and jumped through the broken wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were four stories high, but she showed no hesitation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Through the side of my vision, I could see Ryouka standing up unsteadily, black smoke emanating from her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-what are you doing! G-go after them! Don’t let them get away and k-kill them!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, she was pissed. It served her right.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t have much magic power left, but the lightning was so powerful. Misa is so freaking awesome.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If the tank were full, Ryouka would have turned into charcoal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hold your tongue!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh,” I groaned as we impacted the ground. I felt like my insides were going to burst out through my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara started running without paying attention to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(This is fast, way too fast. It’s like driving a car… I’m scared!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun. You did well. I’m impressed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we ran, Fujiwara remarked with admiration. How unusual of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But that wasn’t the problem right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-y-you’re welcome, b-but don’t drop me! I’ll die… Waa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ha! You are really embarrassing. It would be a lot better if you weren’t like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if you said it, I couldn’t help but be scared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Fujiwara quickly ran, I felt the wind resistance hitting my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unbelievable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha… No way!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, as I heard her shocked tone, I found myself weightless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Huh? Ah, ooo!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened my eyes and saw that we were floating in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned around and saw Fujiwara’s foot caught in a magic circle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ga-ha.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My body slammed into the ground, and the air got forced out of my lungs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pain was so intense that I couldn’t stand up. I had no strength left in my limbs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(What?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">My left arm had bent in a weird way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(No way, did it break?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">My grimoire was also blown away by the impact…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-it hurts, what just happened…! Sh*t, sh*t, sh*t…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun, run…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked behind, I saw several students surrounding Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was an ambush.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment the students put their hands on their grimoire, a barrier blocked Fujiwara from all sides. Even she couldn’t do anything against a seal maintained by several people.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the first place, she had very little magic power left.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-there you are! Haha… I f-finally caught you, Ashiya-kun…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I stood up, gritting my teeth, I saw Ryouka with an angry smile on her face. Behind her were her cronies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe one of her cronies healed her with healing magic… Dammit…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh my god, t-that was a terrible blow… If it weren’t for these, who knows what would have happened…! Now, I’m going to return the favour… Are you ready for this, Sota Ashiya?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps because of her extreme emotions, Ryouka’s voice was slightly trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The instability of her emotions, which may cause her to do anything, was extremely frightening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute, time-out. I don’t feel my arm anymore. It’s broken. I’m probably more seriously injured than you, Ryouka. I’ve had enough, and if anything, I’m going to faint from the pain.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about the broken bones? Y-you almost killed me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no! That’s a misunderstanding! I was confident that you would block it, and that’s why I did it. It’s a sign of trust. And look, you’re all fine, aren’t you? Ryouka, you’re amazing. I respect you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With sweat on my face, I blurted out some nonsense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, Ryouka stumbled over to me and clutched my broken arm as hard as she could.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I screamed in extreme pain, and Ryouka lifted the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad you trust me! It seems I was wrong about you, Ashiya-kun! You’re not just a small fry who has a strong familiar supporting you. I was sooo wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m just a small fish. Look, I’m in serious trouble. Please stop.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then be mine, will you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want that either… Hiii&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can you say such a foolish thing in this situation? That’s some balls you’ve got! But you see, you don’t have a choice! If you don’t want to be mine, I’ll have you fed to the demons…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, that’s seriously not the thought process of a high school girl. What’s wrong with your head?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious! If you want, we can start by killing that damned woman first.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Both of Ryouka’s eyes were bloodshot as she screamed in desperation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was hard to pull back because she could really kill Fujiwara right now. It wasn’t good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya, kun… guh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara groaned and fell to her knees, probably because the barrier cut off her supply of magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stopped moving, gasping for air. I wonder if her magic power had run out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was the worst. If I left Fujiwara like this, her life would be in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha. It seems that the magic power supply ran out. I wonder what will happen if I leave her alone. She’ll die, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I glared at Ryouka, who had a grin on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you really going to kill us? Is that a good decision? Do you think your crime will go without being found out? Let me assure you. They’ll find out eventually. That’s why hear me out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s with that? Is that the reason you’re begging for your life?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just listen!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I shouted, Ryouka choked on her words, “What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I distracted myself from the pain and tried to catch my breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even if you completely destroy the evidence, the people from the East will delusionally believe that you are the culprit. That’s who they are. The suspicion will definitely spread outside the university, and if that happens, a full-scale war between East and West could start. It’ll be your fault. Can you take responsibility for that? Are you sure you aren’t rushing things? It’s not too late for you to calm down and reconsider!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka’s voice churned as she shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah… I’ll do whatever I want! If I can’t beat Mari… I’ll kill her! I’ll kill you if I have to too! I’ll do whatever it takes!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You need to calm down! Is that really the best you can do? Do you really think you’re doing the right thing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up! Why do you hate me so much? I said I’ll give you everything if you join the West! There’s no reason not to, so why can’t you be mine?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You idiot, as if I’d side with murderers! Use a little common sense!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I yelled, Ryouka looked dumbfounded for a moment, but she recovered soon after.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t killed anyone yet! That’s beside the point, though!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I don’t give a sh*t! I said, let us go! I won’t even tell the school if you do! I’ll even help you fight the President if you want, but I’ll never join a faction! You’ll have to weigh the risks and benefits of killing us before you make your decision! You idiot!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Won’t it all be fine if you join the faction? Why do you hate me that much?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I hate you! You really need to take a look at your own behaviour before you say that again, you piece of sh*t.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka shouted, “You b*****d!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She hit me in the stomach with her knee as if taking it out on me and looked back at her cronies behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Go get a kobold! I’ll feed him to it! One bite on the arm and this fool will change his mind!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um, Miss, are we really going to do that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of the cronies opened her mouth in fear. It was obvious that they were scared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I guess she didn’t expect me to resist so much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka glared at them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I see. So even you don’t believe in my resolve either?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-that’s not it! I’ll go find one right away!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just like spiders scattering, the cronies went looking for a kobold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Only a few people remained to maintain the barrier around Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka humphed irritatedly and swung to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There, here is an extra one! You deserve it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I cowered as she kicked me in the stomach and stomped on me some more.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now’s the time to change your mind, Ashiya-kun! This is your last chance!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ignored Ryouka and turned my attention to Fujiwara, who had stopped moving inside the barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered if she was all right.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now that the magic supply had been cut off, I didn’t know how she would be able to maintain her vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Also, what did she think of our current situation? Was she willing to die rather than joining the West? Or was she somehow going to take advantage of Ryouka?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, that wasn’t in her nature.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t imagine Fujiwara’s ego giving in to such absurd pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter how much you stare at Fujiwara, she won’t help you. In fact, Ashiya-kun, shouldn’t you be the one to save her? All you have to do is say you’ll obey me, and you two will live.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I do that, Fujiwara will kill me anyway… Why are you so obsessed with power? What’s so great about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I continued with sarcasm, “What a simpleton you are, Ryoka. Is the position so important for you to turn this pathetic? I really feel sorry for you. It’s a pity that you’ve been compared to the President since the moment you were born. You should forget this and live a more carefree life.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up your lame mouth. If you don’t, I’ll break your other arm too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She sounded cold. It seems that I have hit her weak point.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a short pause, I shut my mouth. I didn’t care about Ryouka’s personal situation, I didn’t want to die because I swore like a son of a b*tch before. I didn’t think she would let me die quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked at Fujiwara again, trying to hold back the pain in my arms and stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now that I think about it, my life’s been in danger ever since she became my familiar. Seriously, was I really going to die this time?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Damn it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thinking about it, I was more desperate back with the demon than I do now. A demon’s intimidation was so strong that it could just kill someone with a gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, if Fujiwara dies, will that demon die with her?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right now, Fujiwara was in control of that body, but I had heard that the demon’s consciousness was also sleeping somewhere in her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s right. The demon was still alive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If so, is she also suffering from the pain?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt the fragility of the world when I thought that such a strong demon could be killed by Ryouka anytime.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t like it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">!!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">What happened to her?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was thinking, I saw Fujiwara staring at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When did this happen? There’s no way she had any magic power left, so how?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard her feeble voice as the wind swiftly passed by.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Lend… me… your… strength.”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was an inaudible whisper, yet I could hear it getting louder and louder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Strength… Give me… your power… this time… Give me… enough power to… protect Ashiya-kun. Lend… me… everything…! I’ll give you everything! All of it…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her speech was irregular and sounded like she was hallucinating. She was talking to herself…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Also, what do you mean to protect me? Don’t tell me you’re worried about me and not yourself in this situation?</p>
<p class="calibre4">How could that be? You should think about yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And yet, I could do nothing but to feel the desperation in her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka grunted, “Hah? What’s with her? It seems your servant lost her mind from fear.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was no longer interested in Ryouka’s mockery. I kept staring at Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, who had been pleading to someone, fell silent. It seemed as if some switch had flipped in her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her fingertip twitched, and the vibration quickly spread to her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah, argh. Aaa, AAAAAAAAH!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fire emanated from her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to endure the intense pain, she scratched herself and bent her back into an arch, and her jet-black hair turned scarlet. It was as if her hair itself became a flame.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The flames spread in the blink of an eye and engulfed her entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the first time I’ve ever seen such a transformation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her face became more dignified. Her body became more feminine. Her limbs grew longer, and her skin became even more translucent. Even her clothes changed from a uniform to a gorgeous crimson dress…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka and her minions stood dumbfounded at this sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t understand what was going on either, but I knew that this transformation was not good for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, all I could do was watch and wait.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, the transformation ended, and there was the demoness, the very entity of crimson flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The maniacal smile she wore was a look I had never seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ku-ku, Kuhaha… Hahahahahahaha!!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She laughed loudly with such intensity that it made her previous weakness look like a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s body, soul, and everything had been taken over by that demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Finally! At last, that damned little girl has disappeared!” As if to confirm my thoughts, she happily stated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And while everyone else was motionless, only one person caught her eye.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord! We have met at last! Though a human, you have taken this lady under your wing. Kuha, kuahaha!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The demoness waved her index finger in the air, and with that simple movement, the barrier around her shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The cronies started to panic, but there was nothing they could do. They were defeated one after another by her slaps. Yes, slaps.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, ah?” Ryouka grunted. “What’s with that appearance? Isn’t she supposed to have run out of magic power and become immobile? How did this happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? No magic power? Are you referring to this lady? I have plenty of magic power of my own.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if to answer her question, countless blue lights appeared around the demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic particles in the atmosphere vibrated. A large amount of magic power that seemed from another world swirled and got absorbed by the demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wonderful, the concentration of magic power in this world is dense! It’s so powerful!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">No way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How was this possible? That woman was able to absorb magic power from sources other than me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If that’s the case, she’s beyond our world’s knowledge. She’s entirely a foreign being.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if she had been turned into a familiar, there’s no way a summoner could control her because she could move around at will without any need for the summoner’s magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t use the right of life and death on her. The shackles that restricted the magic power production in her body were useless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You phony,” Ryoka retorted. “This can’t be happening. Impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka glared at the demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her entire body, covered with red magic circuits, responded to her anger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter who you are? I won’t let you ruin my plan…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She clenched her fists and accelerated with a step, cracking the ground, and leaped at the demoness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The demoness, in return, waved her hand in annoyance at the presence that was closing in on her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Impudent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In conjunction with the demoness’ movements, an invisible force struck Ryouka from the side, twisting her body and blowing her away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She crashed into the outer wall of an abandoned building.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Cracks appeared on the wall as it crumbled and fell.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gah, Ha- Hah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka struggled to get up, but she didn’t have the strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Vomiting blood and scraping the ground, she was like a bug with its legs crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The difference in strength was overwhelming.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, I knew that the demon was strong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara, a summoner weak at physical combat, had been dramatically strengthened after fusing with her. In addition, I had seen how violent she was during the summoning test, so there was no reason to think she was weak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I never thought that the change in consciousness would make such a difference.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was unable to move due to surprise, the demoness came to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiled and sat in front of me. A strange light illuminated from both of her palms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was about to be killed, so I reminisced about the summoning test.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She sure had a grudge against me for what I did to her that time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She put her right hand on my head. I forgot to breathe and just stared into her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But… the pain I was prepared for did not come.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the contrary, my broken arm got enveloped with a warm sensation, and the pain eased.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked over and saw that my arm, which got grotesquely disfigured, had healed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Healing magic, huh? And quite advanced…</p>
<p class="calibre4">But why did she?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was puzzled, she kneeled down in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m Sofia Edel Eilam, the Third Imperial Princess. You refer to me as Sofia. My Lord, in the name of the God I believe in, I hereby swear that I will become your sword and spend my life paving the way for your victory.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">What was that?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t process this sudden development…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I noticed that the mark of obedience was still engraved on her forehead. Well, since she’s linked to Fujiwara, she might be under its control. So many things happened all of a sudden that I completely forgot about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I replied with a tense face, “Thank you for the courtesy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way to victory!</p>
<p class="calibre4">As if I would ever walk that path.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you stand? Let me give you a hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh? Oh, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I grabbed her hand and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The demoness, smiling, turned towards Ryouka, who was still struggling and leaped in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, My Lord. What to do with this little girl who doesn’t know her place? I believe that only with death she can atone for her foul play.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, uh… I wonder about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her remark was vicious. I could understand why she wanted to do that, considering what she had done to us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But in this era, if I were to take another’s life for such a reason, it would turn the rest of my life into h**l.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I struggled thinking about what to say, the demoness focused her magic power into her palms in front of Ryoka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka cowered, while I couldn’t believe my eyes at how much potential she had. Her arms started to glow like they were on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s amazing…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not even a piece of flesh would remain in this world after being hit with that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hii. No, please don’t… Save me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka shivered and begged for her life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had broken completely. Just what happened to her earlier show-off?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There is no such thing as mercy for fools…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Demoness turned around as if something caught her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I followed her gaze and saw that Ryouka’s cronies had returned and were looking at us, unable to comprehend the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord. Should I kill them all together?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Absolutely not! I don’t know what it’s like in your world, but here, killing someone is a big deal! It is national law!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? What a soft world. Life is meant to be taken. Hmm. I guess the Lord will have to rule and correct the order to the way it should be.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While saying something disturbing, she raised her finger with a twitch, a flash of lightning fell from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The explosion tore the ground, and the cronies were blown away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no idea what just happened, but after a few beats, I finally understood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This woman could drop lightning with just a flick of her finger? How could it be possible…?</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">Unbelievable. The crater created by the lightning was so wide and deep that it could easily fit a one-story building. What would happen if it were to hit a person? I bet not a single hair would remain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’d be best for me to keep my distance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You bunch of imbeciles. If you overstep your bounds and dare come close to me, you will lose your lives. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The demoness huffed, then turned to Ryouka again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, what should I do with you? You are the one leading them, so I won’t let you easily get away with this. I will make you suffer so much pain that you will hate your own life, and only then will I kill you,” She announced with a joyous smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her smile was that of a delinquent kid whose moral compass has yet to develop completely. Even though it wasn’t directed at me, it sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka looked up at me with a pale face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could see an excessive amount of moisture accumulate in her eyes. I mean, she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, of course, she should be. Even I would cry and s**t my pants if I were in her place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A-A-Ashiya-kun, p-please save me… I was wrong, please…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The arrogant attitude of the woman who was convinced of her own superiority was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was unsightly. It’s annoying when people flip out like this when the tables turn against them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I’d like to give her a lesson.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I almost got killed…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I said deliberately, trying to make a point.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I let you live, you will try to kill me again. Oh, I wonder what I should do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no intention to kill her, but of course, I had to put a nail in the coffin. At any rate, if the demoness hadn’t manifested, Fujiwara and I might have died.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not that of a sentimental human being who can forgive anyone out of kindness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m s-sorry… I won’t do it again. I’ll do anything you say, p-please save me…!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t believe you. You’re so ambitious. Once you see an opening, you’re gonna come after us again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I t-told you it won’t happen again. I’m telling you the truth. P-Please trust me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Bulls*it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord. The dead don’t betray. We should kill those you don’t believe. Allow this lady to do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that this demon really did not care about human life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without a second thought, she concentrated her magic power on her palm again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hii&mdash;!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute! That’s the last resort! Uhm, I mean, let me think of a better option.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I said, the magic power that had been exuding out of her palm disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, consider yourself lucky. My apologies for the haste. My Lord sure is merciful…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was out of tune with the overly obedient servant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remembered that she almost killed me during the summoning test. But now, she has changed completely, at least for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she happened to be by my side, there would be no one more reliable than her. She’s scary, though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, what should we do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka shivered as I spoke to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was like a prisoner on death row who heard the footsteps of the approaching guards.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A-Ashiya-kun, please spare my life…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her tearful face was so pathetic that I felt pity for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Let’s not say I want to bond with her. It’s just; I was going to have trouble dealing with her. I couldn’t think of a punishment befitting her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First of all, I didn’t want to kill her. I definitely wanted to avoid the aftereffects. Since Ryouka was one of the big names in the West branch, they would bring us more trouble if I acted rashly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Above all, I had no fetish for cruelty. S***w hitting and being hit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, physical punishment was not an option.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, should I make her sign a contract to stay away from us forever? No, that’ll be not much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asking for money wouldn’t be good, either. She’ll be sure to be expelled if she did it, and I don’t like the idea of her resenting me for it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the other hand, if I could win her favour here, I might be able to make use of her later on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, but she might betray me any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm… hmmm… Aha!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I recalled the moment of my first quest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s it. In times like this, we should just eliminate the root cause.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In short, this girl was trying to draw us in so that she could defeat the President. If that’s the case, we should bring her into a situation where she can’t resist the President no matter how hard she tries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And this would be the best punishment for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“All right. I’ll explain the whole thing to the President and let her deal with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t describe the look on Ryouka’s face the moment I said that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was relieved that her life was saved yet in despair that her ambitions were about to be crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two polar emotions mixed together to form a comical switch between faces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A-Ashiya-kun? I know I’m being greedy. But if you can, please let it be someone else…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t like it? Then I have no choice. I don’t want to think about it anymore, so I’ll leave it to my Nee-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment the demoness gathered magic power in her fists with a grin, Ryouka quickly shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then her face twisted to that of an affectionate smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no! I’ll accept that! There’s no way I’m going to let Ashiya’s decision get in the way of my own! Thank you so much! You’ve forgiven me for such a terrible thing I’ve done! I’m indebted to you! I’ll follow you for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It looked like she was about to cling to my legs. So this is what it means to be desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could no longer feel she had any desire for revenge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it didn’t matter. In fact, this was probably the safest way to end it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord, you’re too kind to be true,” The demoness said in a slightly amused tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka nodded her head at her words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Haha, it serves you right.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m really sorry about this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The day after, I successfully handed Ryouka over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was summoned by the President of the student council after school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no one in the room except her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I really don’t know what to say. My sister, Ryouka, has caused you a lot of trouble…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I entered the room, the President bowed deeply in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With her back straight and her hips bent at a right angle, she showed her gratitude so beautifully that it could be featured in an etiquette book.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know that no amount of words will ever be enough, but please…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The President, with an exhausted tone, apologized so earnestly that it made me feel bitter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s alright. I understand how you feel, so please raise your head.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I said this, unable to bear the heavy atmosphere, she slowly raised her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her complexion was pale with a sense of fatigue that she could not hide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No. It’s not your fault, President. You’re apologizing too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true. It was my fault for spoiling her too much. If I had been more careful, she wouldn’t have bothered you… I feel so ashamed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She furrowed her brows and bit her lips. I could feel her regret more than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at her expression, I wondered if human beings were capable of regretting like this. At least I couldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t have to be so responsible for other people’s actions. You’re not her mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahm, mother, you say,” She cleared her throat. “No, I’ve always taken care of her in some way, and I thought of her as my own sister. And now that she’s caused you so much trouble, I can’t help but think that I didn’t educate her well. If only I’d raised her right…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought that the harshness of her upbringing might have been the cause of Ryouka’s personality, but I couldn’t bring myself to point it out. Also, please read the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, there’s nothing for you to worry about. I’ll be bothered if you apologize more than necessary.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I see. It’s selfish of me, but I feel a little better now that you’ve said that. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiled modestly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She sure was earnest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sat down on the sofa near the office table.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, where is she? I haven’t seen her at all on campus today,” I asked the President, who was sitting opposite from me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She replied while sighing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Old Masters of the main family are giving her a hard time. I don’t think she’ll be coming back to school for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really? Is that her punishment?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It might be. The main family was furious because of this incident, and they couldn’t forgive the fool from the branch family for plotting a rebellion. I couldn’t even protect her. But it’ll be a good lesson for her even if it hurts for once.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way she spoke so softly was heartbreaking. It’s not that I had any grudges against Ryouka, but she almost got me killed, so I wanted her to feel some pain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a matter of personal judgment and punishment. So I did.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The President rubbed her brow and smiled lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t thank you enough for not reporting her to the school and handing Ryouka directly to us. Thank you. She could have been expelled from school, but somehow I was able to save her neck. You see, even a girl like her is a cute little sister to me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ryouka detested her, but the President didn’t seem to detest her back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s cute about that sister you yours?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well. I always have a soft spot for both my younger brother and sister.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Huh? Do you have a younger brother, President? Weren’t you an only child?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I expressed my doubts, she stared at me in silence. Her straightforwardness seemed to appeal to me, but I had no idea what she wanted to say, so I could only remain confused.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I called her out, she let out a distressed sigh as if she had given up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ah, yes. You’re right, Souta-kun. I don’t have a brother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought so. But what was that pause you just had?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nothing. It’s okay if you don’t understand. At least, I’m definitely an only child right now. I guess that’s why I care about Ryouka more than I should.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way she said it, as if the words were stuck in her tongue, was enough to convince me that she was keeping some secrets. However, I didn’t feel comfortable getting involved in someone else’s family affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, even if she did have siblings in the past, she doesn’t now, and I didn’t want to know why.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. Anyway, I’ll leave it to you to deal with your lovely Ryouka.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Despite the way you put it, I understand. I’ll have Ryouka apologize to you again in person.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand. I’ll leave you to it then…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, wait a minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I stood up, she stopped me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She glanced down as if she was having a little trouble saying it, but then she quickly looked up at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fujiwara-san… Is it possible to bring her back…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I shook my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No. The demon has completely taken over her body. I’m sorry to say, but… there’s still no way to get her back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The President’s expression darkened, “I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe she felt guilty because it was caused by Ryouka’s rash actions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t look at me like that. I’ll do something about it. I’m also a little troubled by the fact that Fujiwara’s consciousness is still missing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“O-oh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The President was stunned by my comment… Eh? Why?</p>
<p class="calibre4">The look on her face was the same as if she had just seen a delinquent rescue an abandoned kitten.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I know I said something that didn’t suit me, but I wasn’t expecting this reaction. I was rather shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it because of my usual behaviour?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her eyes wandered hesitantly, and she continued while looking away,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, what do you think of Fujiwara-san, Souta-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s this all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, nothing serious. I’m just kind of curious.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was sure that we had a relationship that could easily be misunderstood, but I never thought that even the President would ask me this question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm… How do I feel about Fujiwara?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No words came to mind. So I looked back at my memories of her. From the day I met her until yesterday when her consciousness disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How was she? I can’t think of any reason that had either a good or bad impression on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only thing I remembered about her was that she tormented and mistreated me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I shouldn’t help her. But even so, we have lived together for a short time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The more you spend time together, the more compassionate you might be…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe not.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s a joke, but at the very least, I couldn’t forget the last thing she did, so I wanted to help Fujiwara. I honestly feel that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A troublesome partner, I suppose.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I struggled to come up with the right words, she gave me a rather smug look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Partners, huh? Is that as a summoner and a familiar?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She heard my affirmation and gave me a small nod.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. Well, whatever it is, you said you’d take care of it. I guess you’ll make it happen.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she smiled as if somewhat relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Again with the secrets.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I am so tired of hearing this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you… for your unworthy high praise as always.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s so unworthy about it? You can do anything if you put your mind to it, Souta-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gave me a sharp look, full of conviction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have a talent for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe, I do.</p>
