<h2 class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre11">Short Story &ndash; The Tale of a ‘God’</strong></h2>

<p class="calibre4">I had a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a dream about a girl with long black hair, who was about to enter junior high school, and me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl looked a lot like Fujiwara, but a smaller version of how she currently is.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were somewhere in the darkness, in the centre of a giant magic formation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The magic formation was incredibly complex, and I couldn’t understand its composition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Somehow, I knew that the magic formation was a summoning circle, but that was all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know why I was struggling to draw such an advanced thing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl who looked like Fujiwara was watching me work without doing anything. We seemed to exchange a few words every now and then, but the dream was silent, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, I completed the magic formation and smiled at the girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl, on the other hand, was serious. Yet, there was a hint of exhilaration in her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I activated the magic formation, and out of the dazzling light came…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Whoa!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">God, in the form of a woman, and…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly looked around and found myself in my room, sleeping on the sofa as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was pitch black. Fujiwara was sleeping quietly on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… Ah, ah? What was that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dream?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt like I had dreamt about something very important, but I can only remember it vaguely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s like I’ve forgotten something important…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hnn… What happened…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was trying to recall what I had forgotten, Fujiwara groaned and squirmed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she opened her eyes, her face twisted into a mangled mess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Apparently, I woke her up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara rubbed her sleepy eyes and reached for the phone under her pillow, squinting at the bright screen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fwah… It’s not even midnight yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, I woke you up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara raised her upper body, giving off an unattractive look. Not an ounce of cuteness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I found out when we started living together, this woman didn’t appear to be a good sleeper.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nothing, I just had a weird dream and woke up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha? You had a nightmare?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know if it was a nightmare or what. I might sound crazy, but I had a dream that we were kids, and we were doing something together…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“─Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know. We didn’t even know each other before we started school, and it was just a dream. But somehow, I feel like it was something vital. I feel as if I’m forgetting something.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, tell me, tell me. What were we doing in that dream?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara’s sullen face changed, and she asked me with a curious look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s as if she completely woke up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? What’s with that look?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just tell me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her unexpectedly strong tone of voice scared me lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t remember the details well, but I think we were trying to summon something? There was a huge magic formation in some dark place, and that girl looked like you… huh? Fujiwara?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara looked at me with eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What’s with the reaction?</p>
<p class="calibre4">You’re being ridiculously dramatic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Souk&mdash;” Fujiwara choked on her words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way. No way…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m being weird, aren’t I? It’s just a dream, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s not… S-Souta, have you remembered anything…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was taken aback when she suddenly called my name.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, not at all. Why are you calling my name all of a sudden? That’s creepy. Are you sleeptalking?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara dropped her gaze in blatant disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… I’m not sleepwalking, but you? You wasted my time waking me up at this hour and telling me some weird… story.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I said I am sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmph.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fujiwara laid down with the futon over her head, turning away and muttering.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ashiya-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a few seconds of hesitation, she added, “If… you remember… the dream tomorrow morning, I’d like to talk to you again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tilted my head at Fujiwara’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What was she so worried about?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t care.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So… good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. Good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I pulled the covers over my head, my consciousness sank into a deep reverie, as if hit by magic.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♦♦♦</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Ashiya-kun.” When I left the dormitory in the morning and headed for the school building, Fujiwara, who was walking next to me, said, “Can you tell me about the dream you had last night?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I looked vaguely at Fujiwara.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dream?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? What do you mean by the dream? Did you see something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I asked her back, Fujiwara muttered, “I knew it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked a little sad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know why, but the look on her face made my heart ache.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s with that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nothing. It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With that, Fujiwara kept her mouth shut.</p>
