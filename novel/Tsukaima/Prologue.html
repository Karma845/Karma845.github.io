  <strong class="calibre11">Prologue &ndash; A Story That Begins With An Unusual Master-Slave Relationship</strong></h2>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmph. It’s just a Stone Golem, the lowest-ranked monster.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked for the voice’s owner and found a female student with strikingly shiny black hair leaning against the wall looking at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was my classmate, Chikage Fujiwara.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I wondered what she was doing here. Since I had no time, I ignored her and looked back at the examiners.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A middle-aged male teacher wearing a black robe, the classic formal attire of a sorcerer, gave me a slight nod.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Very well. Souta Ashiya, you have passed the summoning exam and will be allowed to advance to the next grade.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I patted my chest at those words.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A mage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It is the term used to describe those who can use magic power to cause supernatural phenomena.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">There are only a few people in the world who wield magic. There have been many disputes with the public in the past because of this. But after several twists and turns, they have settled down to the point where mages are considered ‘rare, but they do exist.’</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well then…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked at the summoning formation on the floor and the familiar which was entirely made up of stone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The Stone Golem. It was the first monster I had summoned from another world.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Getting a familiar means that you have obtained a provisional license as a Summoner, and at the same time, it means that you have been promoted to the second year of the International Mage Association’s affiliated school in Japan, the Boundary Interference Department.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In other words, I had now taken my first step as a Sorcerer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… Yes. As a person who doesn’t like to work, I’m not as happy as I should be, but I’m more depressed that my moratorium was steadily diminishing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wait a minute.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I was about to leave the exam room with the familiar, Fujiwara stopped me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ah, you were still here!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Aren’t you ashamed to have such a weak familiar?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara is the top student in our grade and a talented girl. She was next in line to become student council president.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yet, for some reason, she is a strange girl who always gets involved with what I did at every turn. This time, she even went out of her way to observe my exam and complain about it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Is watching other people’s exams without permission even allowed? I don’t think so.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;“Oh, are you talking to me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Who else is here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">There were three examiners. You could’ve asked any of them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I don’t think so, oh future great sorcerer, Chikage Fujiwara-san. You shouldn’t be talking to a piece of trash like me. Are you bored by any chance? Even so, you shouldn’t. You need to make the most of your time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Aren’t you ashamed of being such a pathetic Summoner?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It can’t help it even if I self-deprecate myself. But still, she’s a pain. I bet she was going to preach to me again anyway.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Nope. I guess I don’t know the word ‘worthy,’ Fujiwara. It is enough for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She clenched her fists in annoyance and stepped in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oh, no. I raised my hands in panic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wait, violence is not good! Let’s just talk it out! What’s wrong with you? What is it you don’t like so much? Please don’t! I’m ready to rub my forehead on the ground if I have to… Hiii&mdash;.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She grabbed me by the collar.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Why are you still unaware? Why can’t you aim for something higher?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t deny that I’m unaware, but please don’t try to physically lift me higher instead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I groaned as she lifted my collar.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I can’t breathe.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m going to summon a Demon right now. Even though I’m just a student, I will challenge a difficult feat, even for a first-class summoner. And you, sit tight watch with your low-level monster.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A Demon is a humanoid monster that can manipulate powerful magic at will. They have extremely high physical capabilities and magical power. They are considered to be the highest-ranking summons that can be used by mages.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It’s said that there are only a few sorcerers in existence who can summon Demons as their familiar.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I snickered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“How can you pass the exam with just your self-esteem? What if I try too hard, fail, and fail? Fujiwara, you should relax and live more comfortably. Just like me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara’s eyebrows furrowed. She loosened her grip and then just stared at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m dumbfounded. Enough. Just stay here and watch my examination. I’m sure that even a bonehead like you will have a change of heart once you see my feats firsthand! Yes, that must be it! You should tremble at the sheer fortune of witnessing my feats from a privileged seat! It’ll be special!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She pointed a finger at my face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Please get rid of it. It was depressing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I’ve to go to a party with my friends to celebrate my graduation. Yei!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“For that kind of thing… Why can’t you just… understand?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Wait! That was a lie! It’s a lie, and I’m going to watch, so pull back your fist!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As Fujiwara prepared her fist with killing intent, I hurriedly pleaded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… Geez. She’s too hot-headed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Contemplating, I took the Stone Golem and stood by the wall, away from Fujiwara.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You have to watch me. I won’t forgive you if you run away!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She shouted, and I waved my hand in the air.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She stared at me suspiciously and picked up a brush dipped in magic paint. She ran the tip of the brush across the floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was drawing a summoning formation. It was far more complex than the one I had drawn to summon the golem.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Just looking at it was depressing. I’m sure if I worked hard, I could understand the formation to some extent, but I just didn’t feel like it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Hmm?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I stared blankly at it, Fujiwara, who had completed the summoning formation, gave me a smug look.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What do you think? Doesn’t it look artistic?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s amazing. By the way, in addition to the main magic circuit, are you using three auxiliary circuits outside of the system?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She raised her eyes when I asked a question without thinking.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You can tell! You do have talent, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her gaze was fixed on me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t you think you’re wasting your talent? If you work hard enough and develop your talent, you can become a great mage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There’s no way I have such great talent. Motivation is the most important talent.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“When people are rotten to the core, they can’t take even well-intended advice seriously.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Are you the kind of person who can’t even breathe unless you make fun of me every now and then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She ignored me and picked up the grimoire from the floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She placed her palm on the cover, and after a beat, the magic formation started to glow with blue light.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She had activated the summoning formation through the grimoire.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A grimoire is an auxiliary device that helps mages control the magic power released from the magicians into its desired form.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Even though we mages can generate magic power in our bodies, we don’t have the means to convert it into magic directly. Therefore, when we want to use magic, we have to process it through an auxiliary device or chant a ridiculously long spell for minutes on end.</span></p

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Well, in modern magic, using auxiliary devices is the mainstream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Whatever technology needed was refined and optimized throughout history.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, you still need to make your grimoire, and you have to come up with your formulas for activating magic. It’s where the difference in ability as a Mage, especially as a Summoner, comes in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In other words, Fujiwara, who has an enormous amount of magical power and could create the formula for such flashy magic, was much better than the professionals around the world.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She’s the epitome of talent. I couldn’t help but wonder why she was so full of herself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Here I go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She muttered, and at the same time, the magic formation shone particularly strongly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The woman who suddenly appeared on top of the magic formation was like a personification of hellfire.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her hair flowed down to her waist like a veil, her eyes were big as if to show her strong will, and her dress was gorgeous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The atmosphere surrounding her was dyed deep red. In contrast to her translucent white skin, all of the red stood out. Her face was more well-shaped than any woman I’ve ever seen.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The woman glanced around the room and then caught Fujiwara’s eye.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Is that you? You are the one who summoned this lady to such a lowly world.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes. I want you to be my servant.”</span></p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="images/000000.jpg" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div><p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon narrowed her eyes at Fujiwara’s fearless attitude.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Huh? What’s this nonsense? Don’t you know that this lady is the third princess of Eilam, the Imperial Kingdom?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Where is that? How am I supposed to know when I’m just looking for an individual who might be useful as a familiar?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Fufu, you think this is a joke, monkey? How amusing. I shall grant you death as a reward. Begone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon pointed her index finger at Fujiwara. The moment that fingertip glowed red, she fired a light bullet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It must be offensive magic. How easy it was for a demon to unleash such an attack without any assistive devices or chanting…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, the light bullets were blocked by the barrier on the summoning formation and dispersed before reaching Fujiwara.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, the transparent barrier still wavered considerably. That was a h**l lot of firepower.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara gulped as the demon narrowed her eyes in displeasure, but she didn’t falter and began to inject magic power into her grimoire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Immediately, the demon’s expression turned grim, and she covered her face with one hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ugh… You’re getting carried away! I had enough of this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She might have been under obedience magic, but the demon resisted as her eyes flashed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She probably had a very strong resistance to magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Kuh” Fujiwara groaned in pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Such an intense battle was going on between them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But if it was too intense, it wasn’t very helpful for me to look at, was it? Hmm, I had no time for this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was bored, so I glanced at the stone golem standing next to me. It was a low-grade monster with a simple mind, but it was more than enough for me. I didn’t think I needed anything better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A power that is too much for someone to handle is like poison. People with more power have to do more things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And while I was wondering, the grimoire Fujiwara was holding suddenly ignited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Agh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara threw the grimoire in surprise. It was instantly engulfed in flames, and before falling to the floor, it disappeared without leaving ashes behind!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ha! Why did it burn?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara was astonished, “H-how?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It seemed to be an unforeseen problem. Whether the grimoire couldn’t withstand Fujiwara’s magic, or whether the grimoire itself was inadequate, the obedience magic had failed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She had done it. She was doomed to fail this exam.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’ll have to make her use honorifics starting next year.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Anyway, the most concerning problem was the demon. Without the grimoire, there would be no barrier protecting her anymore, and the unleashed demon would start rampaging.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In fact, the demon was looking down at Fujiwara with a daring smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Fujiwara, back off!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The teachers shouted as they injected magic power into their grimoires and summoned their familiars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A werewolf, an ogre, and a fox demon. All of them were considered high-ranking summons, though none of them are as good as the demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The three familiars attacked the demon under the command of the summoner.&nbsp; </span><span class="calibre12">　</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But,</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Turn to ashes, you vermin!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon brandished her right arm in a horizontal line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Then, explosive flames were created in its path, engulfing the three familiars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">They burned up without a trace. Wow, that was amazing. It was no ordinary flame.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oh no! Does this mean that all of the teachers’ familiars are dead?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You damn Mages. Know your place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon fired an extra-large burst of light at the teachers. It easily broke through the barriers they had created and blew the three of them away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I could hear them groaning, so they were not dead, but the teachers showed no signs of getting up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No way. She was too strong.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Now-now, little monkey. Are you ready for this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hah-hah…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Unable to keep standing, Fujiwara collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t think that you’ll get a swift death… Your crime is being an inferior species and misbehaviour.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon’s eyes completely focused on Fujiwara.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Gulp, I should go and get some help.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">No matter how strong that demon was, if the school’s teachers worked together, they might not lose. Hopefully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">To be honest, I wasn’t sure if Fujiwara would be able to survive long enough to call for help, but there was nothing else I could do. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel guilty, but I didn’t want to die in vain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I ran toward the doorway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Humph, you can’t escape!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon snapped her fingers. As if in tandem, the entire room was covered with a thin layer of invisible magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I reached out to the door, but it didn’t budge. It was stuck. A barrier?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I turned around, the demon was looking at me with a grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I reflexively put my hand on the grimoire and shouted, “Golem, go!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The golem, which had been standing near the wall, obediently ran towards the demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But it was crushed by a single light bullet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’m stupid. A moving stone is no match for a Demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You won’t be a man if you run away without your woman.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Cold sweat broke all over my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… No-no, I’m not running away. I was just going to call for help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Why do you need help? It’s a man’s duty to protect his woman at all costs, you scum. You deserve death. Fine, I’ll grant you death as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’ve been told many things, but I understood what she was saying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I knew that I was a pathetic piece of s**t right now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But you know what?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ah, you see. Onee-san has a good point, but even if I risked my life to protect her, I would only die in vain, and Fujiwara would be killed in the end. If that’s the case, I think the chances of both of us being saved would be much higher if I went to call for help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Fumu. I’ll finish you off even after that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Then, there’s no point in defending Fujiwara.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There is no point, you say? But if you are a man, you have to protect her, even if it’s for nothing. Do you understand? Then be prepared.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t understand a word she was saying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was sure she would kill me no matter what I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was done with this b*llsh*t</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t want to die for nothing. I was going to make her as uncomfortable as possible before I die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Then I’ll die, but… Fool.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her lips twitched…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Huh? What did you just say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Oh no, I couldn’t stop sweating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ha! Are you deaf? Is that head of yours full of whipped cream instead of brains?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t even stop swearing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Her face appeared to turn grim.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was scared. It was really scary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But I wouldn’t stop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ho, Hou? Whipped cream, huh? Do you know whom you have spoken to with such disrespect? If you don’t know what you’re doing, you will die horribly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Looking at the demon, who was still acting like a big shot, something snapped in my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Shut up, you idiot!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I found myself yelling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Do you think a person who is about to be killed is going to be intimidated by a threat like that? Or will you let go of me if this humble me carefully licks your feet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’ll kill you if you do that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Right? Then who’s going to respect you? You’re an idiot! I’m ready to die. I’m invincible, and I’ve decided that I’ll make fun of you until I die. In this day and age, there are equal rights between men and women. Why should I care about an old hag like you? And what’s with that outfit of yours, are you an underground idol? Or some kind of pervert?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Y-you!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon roared, and her face turned red. Her mouth was open like a goldfish that was trying to breathe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was as if she couldn’t find the right words to describe the emotions raging inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Good luck to me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“In the first place, I’m ten times weaker than Fujiwara, who’s lying over there. I have to save Fujiwara? That’s ridiculous! Can’t you even understand that? You can probably kill me here, but I’m losing my mind! I’m going to make a fool out of you! Do you understand me, you muscle brain? I hope that in your next life, you’ll be born a civilized person who can have constructive discussions.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Y-y-you… you deserve death!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She pointed her palm at me and fired a light bullet!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">My body was blown away by the impact as if I had been hit by a rock, and I rolled on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">My vision blurred, and I couldn’t think of anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Geho! You’re a savage woman who resorts to violence because you can’t talk back. Is your mouth just for decoration? Use your brain, barbarian. Go ahead, kill me. Kill me now! Intelligence wins! Come on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Y-you are still saying that! That’s enough. I’ll crush that filthy mouth of yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In a flash, she came right in front of me. Her arms were glowing like they were on fire as she was concentrating her magic power. The magic power in the air was shimmering in the response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a beautiful sight that made me feel scared. I never thought I’d be able to see the magic of the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Whatever it is, I’m dead. Yes, it was over. May I be reborn as a giant tree deep in the mountains in my next life?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon who was right in front of me raised her arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’ll keep my eyes open until the moment I die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Our gazes met, and she smiled wickedly… and then blew up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It wasn’t me. The demon, who was right in front of me, just blew up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She flew to the edge of the testing room and crashed into the wall. The mortar shattered, and half of her body sunk into the wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Get out while you still can! We’ll buy you some time!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">One of the teachers, who seemed to have woken up, shouted out in a daze. The remaining two also got up and unleashed several offensive magic on the demon while slamming magic power into the grimoire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">However, the demon didn’t seem to be particularly hurt and began to fight back irritably.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was too tough. Was she made up of tungsten?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Thanks for the help… but where are you telling me to run to?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">There was a very powerful barrier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Guess I should head to a corner of the hall so I would not get caught up in the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I grabbed Fujiwara by the arm and dragged her, coughing, to the wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What a mess you’ve made. If the teachers lose, she will kill us next.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I didn’t do anything wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara shouted…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s ridiculous… I wasn’t going to summon such a powerful demon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I thought for a moment that she was making an excuse, but after looking at the desperate look on her face, it didn’t seem like she wasn’t lying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, yeah. I don’t care whose fault it is anymore. We’re going to die anyway. Look at the teachers who are helpless despite being outnumbering her. That woman is too strong. Hey, do you think I’ll get in the way of the teachers if I yell at that demon now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara ignored me, swept her gaze suspiciously, and caught sight of the grimoire in my hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She mumbled with a tense expression and seemed to be thinking about something,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And,</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“We can’t defeat her, but we can turn that demon into a familiar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Didn’t you fail already? I mean, you don’t even have a grimoire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara ignored me again and snatched my grimoire. Then, she started flipping through the pages with great speed and stopped her fingers at a certain… page.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a page about magic to subjugate a summoned demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">After staring at it for a few seconds, she started to unbutton her blouse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oi-oi! What are you doing? Are you so scared that you lost your mind?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t be ridiculous! I have an idea! We’re going to turn that demon into a familiar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What did that have to do with your stripping?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s impossible. We can’t escape. I should die peacefully. I guess I’ll die with a foul mouth…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara took off her blouse and revealed only her upper body. Of course, she was still wearing her skirt underneath. Even so, I can’t help but notice her slim belly and armpits, which are rare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What a disappointment. Hmm, why do you have small b*****s?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I stared at Fujiwara, thinking that I was going to die anyway, she took the bucket that had been left in the corner of the room. It contained a brush, and magical paint, a complete set for drawing a magic formation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara dipped the brush in the liquid, ran it over her abdomen, and began to draw something on herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oi! You’ve lost your mind. Why are you painting your body? Even if you’re out of your mind and your morality got out of control, you shouldn’t be painting your body… And please don’t take off the bra.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I’m drawing a magic formation that will match your magic circuits. Why do you keep talking like this? You’re distracting me, so shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t understand, but she told me to shut up, so I did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara moved her hand craftily and drew a magic circle on her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Apparently, she read my grimoire and constructed a corresponding magic formation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She’s so smart. It’s usually impossible to immediately understand and apply someone else’s magic circuits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s done!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was almost the same time that Fujiwara finished drawing the magic circle that one of the teachers went missing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The balance that had barely been maintained, was broken, and the demon intensified her attacks, and another one fell swoop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">At any moment, the two of us would be next. Our end was near.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Ah, I can’t think of a good death poem. The great old men were amazing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Just as I was about to give up, Fujiwara grabbed my arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ashiya-kun, please! You’re the only one I can rely on!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She looked at me with a strong will.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You can do it! You will if you put your mind to it! So please, don’t give up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">You’re still saying things like that?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Why does this girl have so many expectations of me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Argh… This misunderstanding was terrible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But anyway, she had a plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Okay. If there’s something I can do, I’ll do it. It’s not like I want to die. What should I do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For a brief moment, I saw a thin smile on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Originally, to engrave a mark of obedience on a demon, it would be necessary for the target to be inside the magic formation. But it’s hard to lead that demon to one. So, I’ll act as a magic formation and stick to that woman.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara pointed to her abdomen and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She had drawn a small magic formation on herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“After I stick to her, I want you to use obedience magic. Our magic circuits should be evenly connected.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see. But Fujiwara, will you be okay with that? Using a human body as a magic circle is absurd.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yes, I am. There’s no precedent for this, and it might be reckless, but this is the only way. I can’t back down. This happened because of me, and she will kill me even if I don’t try anything… I’m not a fool. If I’m going to die, I’ll do anything! Otherwise, you won’t forgive me…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">You could see the determination in Fujiwara’s eyes…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see. If you’re ready, it’s fine. Just don’t hold a grudge against me if I fail and you die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No hard feelings. You’ll be dead by then too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">So be it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Fujiwara took a detour and headed behind the demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And at the same time, when the two remaining teachers fell, Fujiwara jumped on her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She grabbed her shoulders and put her legs around her waist. There was no distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ngh… What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Convinced of victory, the demon who was completely off guard raised a surprised voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ashiya-kun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I know!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I circulated my magic power into the grimoire, Fujiwara’s body began to glow blue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon rolled her eyes and fell to her knees.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The glow from Fujiwara’s body increased without bounds, becoming a mass of light in the shape of a person.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The light was so bright that it seemed to burn through my retinas, but I couldn’t take my eyes off it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon who seemed to have finally understood what was happening to him shouted,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Stop… Guha, get off… Get off… Get off me! I’m warning you… Stop it. Are you deaf, monkey?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The distraught demon was swallowed by the overwhelming light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and turned my face away but continued to channel my magic through the grimoire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Eventually, the dazzling light disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon was lying on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A small pattern was carved onto her forehead. There was no doubt that it was the mark of obedience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Did we succeed? I thought I was going to die!!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I don’t know what to say, but where is Fujiwara?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I could only see the demon, and Fujiwara was nowhere to be found.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She’s dead! No way! Guess it was inevitable after such a reckless act, but… Damn, that left a bad aftertaste.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Is that for real? I should at least pray for her soul.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She was annoying, but she wasn’t a bad girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Nanmu-nanmu. I hope she won’t haunt me like a ghost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ugh…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I held my palms, the fallen demon groaned and meekly opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She blinked in a daze.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hn… Ashiya-kun? H-hey… What’s going on? What happened to that demon?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She muttered.</span><span class="calibre12">　</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">*Shivers*</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I felt uncomfortable with her tone of voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Don’t tell me. N-No, that’s impossible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon sat and looked around in awe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ashiya-kun, are you listening? Did we succeed? Where’s that demon…? What’s with that face? Why do you look like a fool…? Huh? There’s something wrong with my voice… Eh…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I took my smartphone out of my pocket and took a picture of the demon (?).</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Then I showed the photo to the demon who was looking at me curiously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The demon… Fujiwara squeezed her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“W-w-wha… What is this? Why did I become a demon…? Ehhhhh?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That’s what I’d like to know.</span></p>
